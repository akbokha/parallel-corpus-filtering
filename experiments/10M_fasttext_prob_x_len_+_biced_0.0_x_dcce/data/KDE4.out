package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; despite its low size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by using this easier .
further information on the use of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions .... open the box card tools and choose the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard modules modules from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the package base , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , containing before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extr@@ as Ab@@ cr@@ ashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for crash , or the list of down@@ stream , if available , delete . &quot;
the module App@@ filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extract filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory on different types .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M architecture in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; to use Extr@@ as DO@@ M tree , and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document , example : document@@ ate , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this worm . &quot;
the module &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view of objects containing the M@@ IME @-@ Type I@@ node / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various tool@@ bar and text views to see the content of your local file system .
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; consists of portr@@ ayed folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of sizes of sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller , or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . therefore , large files can be detected even if you are far down in the folder hierarchy . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; is an entry in the stair@@ way representation , which represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ es@@ ystem . for simpler navigation , the rect@@ angle of reasonable colour and certification settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is swit@@ ched on the colour mode , can be either depth for light detection of the inter@@ viewer or the illustration of another file self , such as name , owner , group or m@@ ime type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be used with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify if there is enough space to display or if the surface of sub@@ ordinate law@@ suit will be used ( whereby consequently , the surface of sub@@ ordinate cl@@ ash may occur ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the marking in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; the surface algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ at &amp; F@@ S@@ View , this goal is not always respected . note that the sub@@ ordinate entries are no longer available . note that less space for the frame is lost if the rect@@ angle square . &quot;
&quot; as a division of the surface of an entry for the sub@@ ordinate entries is left , the implementation is left to implement . here , it is for the circum@@ fer@@ ential and to prevent space wast@@ ed by frames , the best methods of this regard are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimal booked area for an entry over the menu item view . instead , a smo@@ ker will be drawn into the surface of the sub@@ ordinate entry to indicate that this area is actually covered by an sub@@ ordinate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; F@@ S@@ View was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , which was developed for applying K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;
you can find the picture gallery in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extr@@ as picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you call the picture gallery , a dialog will open up with which you can specify the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the option title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page .
the option pictures per line has a sli@@ der and a rotating field to adjust the number of mini@@ images of each line at the gallery .

&quot; display the cross @-@ edge file size of the picture , set firm whether the file size is displayed under the mini @-@ images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; displaying the image size , see whether the size of the images below the mini @-@ images can be displayed in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder , set firm where the gallery will be saved and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file sel@@ ector saving in HTML file , please indicate where the HTML page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the cross @-@ border sub@@ folder , you can adjust to a sli@@ der or set up until which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
&quot; to copy original images , you will copy whether the original pictures are to be copied into the gallery . &quot;
&quot; using the cross @-@ field commentary file , you can specify a commentary file for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the cross @-@ cross area , you can specify a different color image than in the original image . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings offers you an easy access to the general &amp; HTML settings ; settings for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extr@@ as HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

&quot; an easy to use camera interface will be made available to you with your digital camera , so that you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tization . of course , each medium and any ticket cameras will be supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every dealer will be supported by your OS , with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; includes a quick image processing with basic training tools . you can use them to evaluate and correct your photos , comment , and correct . the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE image plugins ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ tization came ; simply to use it , it is dual @-@ time professional skills available . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit Far@@ br@@ aum and all available modules support the raw use by li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC @-@ color administration . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens , which can be sought for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ tization ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; attempts to make the mil@@ king of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the help menu contains an associated entry or wishes . all required information S@@ ind here already entered . follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers came to each other . if you have questions about other users of &amp; digi@@ tization ; however , we would like to answer any questions about other users of &amp; digi@@ tization . in this mailing list , however , we would like to answer any questions about other users . in this mailing list , however , you should be aware of this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ tization ; Homepage to visit news about fre@@ el@@ ded versions and other information about it came .
&quot; the best start to get involved in &amp; digi@@ tization ; is the registration in the developer mailing list . guidance for the registration in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; if you got &amp; digi@@ tization ; for the first time you start , you will be asked where you specify your pictures and your database . you can simply specify a local , remote or remot@@ ely folder . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder , simply click on the folder -@@ symbol folder to select a folder . &quot;
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folder .
later you can add as many folder as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ tization : will you additionally use as Al@@ ben@@ Library . attitudes of the collections set up collections
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the images , as a basic folder . &amp; digi@@ tization ; no picture will be changed . during passing the folder you will get a progress like this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tization came ; dur@@ searches the libr@@ arians in his whole depth . you cannot include sub@@ folders , unless it was i@@ ste in pet@@ eck@@ ter folder . this allows you to insert an item in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will have no photographs as symbols . you can change the game by taking a popular photo from the album and use this on the folder symbol . further details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up in &amp; digi@@ tization ; your digital camera set up ; then you should learn how to use M@@ eine albums and folders , to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw material support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so you can &apos;t cope with it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , so you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu aid resource support . &quot;
&quot; as you set up and work with raw files , in sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ o@@ der@@ Settings and Ro@@ h work@@ flow . &quot;
&quot; an easy to use camera interface will be made available to you with your digital camera , so that you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tization . of course , each medium and any ticket cameras will be supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every dealer will be supported by your OS , with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
modern digital cameras are registered by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ link ) to data transfer . the connection can also be realised as USB @-@ mass storage device . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras can use under certain circumstances to connect the respectable port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tization came ; used the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras . g@@ photo@@ 2 is also supporting the Picture Transfer Protocol , which was continually developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images of digital cameras to machines and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with calcul@@ ator . since photos in general are large files and transmis@@ sions about the seri@@ al port are slow , this connection has been out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation came ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of the pictures with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . you will find a complete list of supported cameras under this link . &quot;
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to have been created with li@@ bex@@ if support . the additional support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 @-@ camera drivers . if the P@@ 50@@ s support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the P@@ 50@@ s support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things along &amp; digi@@ came ; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE image plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module for &amp; digi@@ tization ; the Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as there is also a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ came ; by writing a small module to supplement a function , when the changes entered &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either switch the side with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Um@@ sch@@ alt + F . &quot;
&quot; this and store of pictures works everywhere : you can place an image in a different part of the tree tree , on the horizontal divi@@ ding line or another application window . the only restriction is the image does not appear in keywords , fil@@ en@@ list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a fil@@ yp@@ tic selection allows you to lift you the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields , which is currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . thus , the filter@@ ing on the fil@@ en@@ ames is displayed only if this ind it is displayed and displayed in the dialog box you can configure in the dialog of the aluminum settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your phot@@ ographi@@ es . all photos that have been stored by &amp; digi@@ tization , in which they were stored on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties , or after the date when the album has been created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also add a screens@@ hot directly to an album . select the screens@@ hot of the screens@@ hot . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and move there . you can move on the same way several photos and copy it . simply select all photos and move them onto the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to give you information about this collection . to access the album properties , you must right click on the album and edit in the context menu of the album properties . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name , if you choose a collection from the tool@@ bar or view albums sort by collection . if you want to add new collections or remove new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
Alb@@ um@@ - date : is used when you sort your albums on date with view albums sort by date sort by date .
&quot; the buttons elders , average , latest : these are the date on the one of the oldest , the new image or the average of the album . first , first attempts to calculate the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first came a album in &amp; digi@@ tization ; this is the first image in the album as a symbol for the &quot; &quot; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; &quot; &quot; this is to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first photo in the album is not representative , and you might want to select a different photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select a different photo as an album icon , you must click on the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; as a night@@ mare set . in addition , you can draw the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; an album can always be included in a collection , and collections may not be bl@@ acked . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tization came ; supports the input of sampling for individual photos in the area M@@ a sampling list left down in the main window . album collections have another effect . currently you can use all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window introduces you the main view of your photos . if you choose an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can custom@@ ize the size of these curtains in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time you will briefly wait , while the umb@@ nails will be generated . this can be avoided , in which you can use the Extr@@ as View all of the images . &quot;
&quot; information about any image are displayed below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can change about settings and change . choose the albums page and adjust the area @-@ looking for your wishes . &quot;
&quot; the umb@@ nails feature aid window , the ad . if you can rest the mouse over a moment on a picture . the help displays the main features including all of the keywords of a photos . the screens@@ hot above in the section introduction to the main window shows such a Help window . &quot;
photos are all that made it at &amp; digi@@ tization : about . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . you can get all the functions that associated with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can get the choice between the viewing menu or the menu image in the menu bar . you have the choice between viewing the pictures , a sli@@ deshow or the processing of images . &quot;
you can open the image editing with a photo by calling either F@@ 4 picture editing ... or the context menu of the picture with the right mouse button and editing pane . in the section you will find a guide how to edit your photos . with the image processing you can view your photos and change them .
&quot; it may occur that &amp; digi@@ tization came ; the functionality you need , not available . you can select a photo in another program by selecting the text menu . below , and how to adapt it to your needs , if your program is not enum@@ er@@ ated , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after processing through other image processing programs may come to problems with the related met@@ ad@@ ata programs . some programs do not store this data with the revised image . thus , this information comes from EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , blood , etc . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; represents two ways of rotation at disposal . the simpl@@ est is it with the right mouse button to click on the P@@ review and shoot . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ames of a photos , you can right click on the P@@ review and F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you came a photo of &amp; digi@@ tization ; delete it is del@@ ayed in the M@@ ül@@ men of &amp; k@@ de ; del@@ e@@ 8 image Del@@ ete or Ent@@ f Falls you prefer to really delete , you can use this by Shift ; Ent@@ f . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organized your photos according to the data . &amp; digi@@ tization ; used for this either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ ashe@@ et below in the file sharing , so that you can only be shown the photos of the selected days . &quot;
photos with key@@ boards provide a flexible and powerful opportunity to organize your photos and cat@@ alo@@ es . tags are sti@@ ckers to be assigned to individual photos or all groups . as soon as a key@@ word can be assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this sampling or a search again . &quot;
&quot; if a key@@ word is selected , all photos , which were marked with this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . you can also organize your keywords . you can also summ@@ arize parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My sampling record , so you can find the keywords which you are looking for , easy to find . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and proven key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JP@@ EG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . besides , the keywords in loss of the database re @-@ imported , as soon as you came ; the pictures notice . &quot;
&quot; you can add new tags by clicking on &amp; quot ; My sampling record , and then select new key@@ word . if you have a new key@@ word , after you click on an existing password , this key@@ word is called this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word , right click and delet@@ ing . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a sampling by moving it to the desired position in the tree and put it out there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to push the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be in the tree at a time .
you can modify the properties of a sampling by selecting it with the right mouse button and select in the context menu key@@ word . you can change the name of the sampling and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My sampling .
&quot; to select a different photo as an album icon , you must click on the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu . in addition , you can draw the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to get out &amp; digi@@ tization ; s functionality with key@@ ed handle , you must first select your photos with key@@ word : once you select the photos that you can click on the key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; alternatively , you can also click on the images below and select from the context menu key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can choose a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be shown as soon as you choose one of the keywords for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was done so etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with sampling , this is displayed under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
you can remove a key@@ word in which you can click the context menu of the photo and select from the keywords menu . the menu shows you only the keywords which were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent hist@@ og@@ ram of the number of images per time unit . to select a time frame can select only to the lower rect@@ angle of the selection framework . thus , all related pictures are displayed in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this then appears in the list below .
&quot; include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps , and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; Neb@@ u@@ ck Such@@ box is a small lamp the green is when searching for . if you click here , the filter@@ ing will be deleted and all pictures again displayed . if there is nothing found , then the lamp is red . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this , you get a simple search box such as the top described above . you can also find this search here as a search crit@@ erion . after you have been saved , he added filters in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your choice , press the head OK and the search is displayed . the results will be displayed in My search list in the main window . if you want to change your choice in My search list , you only need to select the appropriate entry from the view of My search list and select a option in his context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to work out , the form to enter the search results again with the previously mentioned search results . if you are looking for an advanced search to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for finding your previous search . here you will find more rules for the Advanced search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search out of the list , select in the context menu search . &quot;
the Exten@@ ded search represents an extended search form with many search parameters available with which you came in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ tization ; s database can be found .
&quot; the list of search rules will be used to set the options for a search query to the Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank . all rules will automatically add or deleted from it . each option can link with other about the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or minus ... link . in addition , you can create Su@@ chen des Type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; create . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; character@@ iz@@ es each picture by a long numbers with a special technique , the hair @-@ algorith@@ m . this allows to compare pictures to compare these sig@@ natur@@ es . the lower the difference between two images , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each picture . by means of an os@@ ell@@ erts , the results can be enlarged or decre@@ ed . if you slide a picture of somewhere else about the symbol of f@@ ew@@ ing search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open up and you can drop it there . &quot;
sketch : hand @-@ hand color sk@@ et@@ ting : draw a quick sk@@ et@@ ches and &amp; digi@@ tization ; find the matching pictures . also here can be a corpor@@ al value .
this rider is an intuitive map search engines available on the Mar@@ ble @-@ mini program . you can drag the mouse button or drag and move it . move it during the left mouse button . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this requires your pictures ge@@ o data .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . he works like a live geo@@ ord@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; represents a lumin@@ ous in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . he works with all supported image data formats , also raw files . &quot;
&quot; choose one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em lumin@@ tically added from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ ous and open its window . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ tization ; main window , you can open the lumin@@ ous fast with L extras lumin@@ escent . &quot;
&quot; from the clo@@ ck@@ bar you can see the pictures you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . if you preview your copy in what window area is to see . if you preview synchron@@ ise from the tool@@ bar and then you can preview them on one of the pictures , then they can compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to order quickly from a picture series . if you want to navigate with the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the fields to the same . use the right neigh@@ b@@ oured picture is displayed in the right side . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal holes also work directly from the lumin@@ ous as e.g. F@@ 4 file mach@@ ining .... &quot;
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both umb@@ nails in the lumin@@ ous . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swing function , which you recognize in the crossed pole . to keep the visible area of the picture , you must keep these anch@@ oring and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed in the mode P@@ review , then both images are shown in the same picture area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . just use the z@@ oom @-@ Reg@@ ulators under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel around in the picture in and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures when you sne@@ ak in the mode P@@ review .
&quot; what is a digital issue , apart from the mode@@ word ? digital components , considered every part of the process after the picture has been taken up until the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos sp@@ ans , sc@@ ans or digital photos , this is not in a systematic and efficient manner . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , provide a plan and practical tips how to secure your images , protect and use photos . we regard the procedure to ren@@ ame , remove , review , em@@ ailing , archi@@ ved , wait , wait and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; quot ; digital components , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , con@@ fabri@@ cated , and exports the content that have a mon@@ et@@ ric or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata are provided in accordance with your definition data that can provide information on or documentation of other data that can be managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you do not know more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need not even know how many photos you have , then you need not even know how many photos you have , then use the met@@ ad@@ ata to be able to access both in a database and in the image files . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you must do and know before you have done anything to your system , the structure of information structure is to be arranged in contrast to your computer . you need to decide whether other access to your photos , whether you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network run &amp; etc . notice that you will need to switch to a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found at your location . if you have enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then export is a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant intake of images to different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years will have 95 % archives and 5 % working files and you will not want to organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the p@@ ile processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files is simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend the option Metad@@ ata store in the setup page of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ tization . this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data stored into the file . if you forget this , then you can also save the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate point in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? this provides a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should now use any photo key@@ word , marking and an assessment . of course , you can select all the pictures that need the same attribute and value the value . this makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let us go with key@@ word , key@@ word , as you can proceed with other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import Catalan images from another source with embedded sampling , then it will come ; automatically the tree for you build b@@ z@@ w the images in the building is not a problem and can simply be done by drag a sub@@ tree on one another . the modified keywords are updated by &amp; digi@@ tization ; updated while it tr@@ acked the under@@ trees . &quot;
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over@@ cut itself . this is a very cru@@ de representation since every block of met@@ ad@@ ata is in truth out of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and cal@@ ender data are qualities of all images .
&quot; enough the keywords - the next section refers to alleg@@ ations or comments , the third important tool for your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you want most nobody to see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are interested in getting your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you will start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . Wow ! it starts to dream , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you might even hear the silence . the cap@@ tion has completely changed your perception of this painting . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos is the title possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest . remember , the key is to be given to the viewer , helping Him more about the mot@@ if you are moving to understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine when an image is not perfect , if the strength has only to act with a cap@@ tion for themselves alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can export as much text , in an internation@@ alised alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as well as lab@@ eling . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . you can even tell him for a selection of pictures at the same time . you have to tell the story to your wishes in the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the web @-@ system . &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find yourself in a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now starts with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities that can open the Ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alisation are already countless . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can export your travel through geography . you can also export the photos at the reception area . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Maps observer . &quot;
&quot; copy@@ left is a wording with copyright and describes the practice to use the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the interior side of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creators and Writ@@ er ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s name , then the name of a company or organisation may not be changed . this field does not support any coma nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ating signs . &quot;
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for editor ) : associated with the author . examples of this field contains the working record of the photographer . examples of this may be as : employee photographer , fre@@ ed photographer or independent commercial photographer . as this is a note to the author , it must be filled out . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the provider to identify who the photo offers . this does not necessarily be the author , if the photographer is listed for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the image is a stock photo , then here the group / Agency will offer the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this is no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge of work with computers , delete or change . the solution for this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this protection is very important for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection against it is very important . &quot;
&quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ tization came , will provide such a module for for@@ kli@@ fts in the near future . &quot;
&quot; topics : PL@@ AT@@ TEN@@ FE@@ H@@ LER , record , black@@ out , EC@@ C , transmission error , aging the storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we are not talking about CDs that have lost on the road or a fire . this kind of losses are the same that you can happen with traditional paper photos or negative . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data re@@ organization of the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a data loss . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs and you must buy them longer than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ ved quality . of course , there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe this is in your measurable room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good cav@@ ity . the best DVD cav@@ ity are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you are writing a lot of reliable . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors , even if you just have written it . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for the form@@ atting and the control of control . despite this massive protection they need for form@@ atting , ultr@@ avi@@ olet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently causes miracles for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; however , there are also similar applications which damaged data from damaged dis@@ ks , HDDs , Flash@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the For@@ mat@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray Disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything about CDs and DVDs was naturally also true for Blu @-@ ray Disk .
&quot; do not burn slowly with a good recording , on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ er format . please read the media with a description , date &amp; author , and afterwards you can store the data on the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
flo@@ ps retain your statistics for themselves . your vend@@ erg@@ arten include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard disk : dis@@ error study &quot;
&quot; in short : dis@@ ks hold the longest when you are operated in the temper@@ ament of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temper@@ ate , these errors are not notice . some of S@@ MAR@@ T are the most common failure . these are particularly read@@ ings and shift counter . the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the full ver@@ able due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a black@@ out if you have saved the files , but these losses can normally get back without big problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices are not much involved , this may result in devices with computer chips and high speed percentage . these can cause serious damage . therefore , these an@@ om@@ alies may cause serious damage , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . therefore , protect yourself from the in@@ avo@@ ids that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against electricity tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that a part of energy heat absor@@ bers absorbed and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar , but remember that not each connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to UL 14@@ 49 Standard . this guarantees a specific minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protection against light@@ ning bolt and thus protects the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as a over@@ voltage of each cable can use to your computer , you should be aware that also all Periph@@ eri@@ als who are connected to your system . this also applies to teleph@@ oning and cable mode@@ ms as well as by these an over@@ voltage . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ ax@@ ial @-@ cable between the cable mode@@ ms and the TV map . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for mo@@ dem . so you are ideal for traveling . &quot;
&quot; while keeping your system protect your system prior to smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete loss . even a fall of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in an inter@@ rup@@ tive @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically transfer cordless energy when a black@@ out occurs . this gives you the opportunity to purchase your data and proceed to the system . if you need a US@@ V then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life @-@ time of the battery and the attached software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concerns about the potential risk that your b@@ illing system is exposed to you and compare your safety in power disorders with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ grade over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . in conclusion , you should always remember all cables before you go to the holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration , you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the hard disk , you are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data about compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . therefore , it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are at your disposal . your free memory is limited to photos , in case of Flick@@ r dramatically anymore . for 25 $ a year you get un@@ restricted memory , which should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data protection , the Web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically transfer@@ able thanks to the TCP protocol automatically and with the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a partial memory . thus , they are Des@@ ast@@ er@@ secure . &quot;
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transmis@@ sions are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody says if a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your computer . all these distur@@ b@@ ances remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection until you . no one seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than that in your computer . &quot;
un@@ reliable PS@@ U are another source of transmission waste because they generate inter@@ ferences within the data currents . for normal file systems these errors are un@@ noticed .
&quot; even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates to deal with turn@@ tables at low level . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for &amp; Linux , and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanism that is used and is also available for &amp; Linux . but it is not part of the core .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data transfer at the not@@ ebook and 46 % at the job systems . at Not@@ ebooks , the proportion of rob@@ bers is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most of viruses . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux , has been no longer si@@ ghted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , travel F@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to give the common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process in a sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . if however , a file cannot be completely saved before the problem appeared , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 Bl@@ ending settings from fundamental physical borders . meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and smo@@ ker characteristic for all types of light sensors are no longer far away .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution has been too high for compact cameras and the end result is more deterior@@ ated for comp@@ ac@@ t@@ cameras and a high quality optics are the optimum solution for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro , so make sure your data is often affected by a data loss . so you can make your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make something dangerous like the rein@@ stall of your OS , the exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you daily make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a light@@ ning proposes you lucky if the drive is not connected to the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster proposes locally and destroyed a lot . forget aircraft un@@ gl@@ ücke : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data hazardous enough . they usually affect a whole room or the complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention means always a not local storage . bring your f@@ uses the stairs up , into the neighboring house , in your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files required to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot of all history and represents a complete copy at a time .
&quot; differential assurance : a backup of the files that have been modified since the last complete backup , creates a complete snap@@ shot of two times : the complete assurance and the last difference . &quot;
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status of any time back to such a backup . this backup comes to a version@@ ing system next to the exception that it comes only down@@ get@@ et and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmis@@ sions the files that were really changed . this happens com@@ pressed and if you want to increase security about ss@@ h .
secure important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer to DVD or other optical medium .
&quot; this approach makes you enough time to detect losses and restore it . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for every month . each other di@@ lu@@ tion should have done manually , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , in the image file stored by X@@ MP files , original , storage , scal@@ ability , media , recur@@ ring images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , refl@@ ector , ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; with that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that is about time period in which you truly are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature is un@@ predic@@ table , all 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is back@@ wards . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use and switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is nowadays available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and visibility format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the subject pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means to enlarge .
let &apos;s go out that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift to a new record :
&quot; check the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected from the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
&quot; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ dc / dc / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ dc / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2 , fat@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier for year to year . &quot;
&quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that disappears from the market . you should therefore no longer use it . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG was developed as an open source standard of GI@@ F . however , X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can save Gam@@ ma@@ - and Chro@@ matic information . this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures . &quot;
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ com@@ pressed form or in a container with a lu@@ sty com@@ pres@@ sion@@ sal@@ li ( De@@ fl@@ ate ) . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G has been developed because of the need@@ y . DN@@ G has been designed now and we hope to use the competitors of Canon and Nikon there at some point .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible met@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the file information for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive a original of your recording , mostly in the resource format , as it saves the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the file file . therefore , you should think about problems when connecting the met@@ at@@ end@@ at@@ ei and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , providing a wide range of applications and modelling , discussions and joint work in the D@@ CM@@ I @-@ Communities and the D@@ CM@@ I working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card@@ les@@ er or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera dium , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your resource archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine processing , you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ tization ; edit , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut under certain circumstances from other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheet , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section add a photos to an album , you can add a description of how you can already add photos to your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import the import of images to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; connect them to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , this is trying to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ ior -@@ indicator is displayed at the bottom and the umb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras are not available , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file access for each file , photos , movies , music etc . on the camera displayed . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information to each entry . with the side features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information that is stored internally from the camera . a symbol shows that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . notice that with some digital cameras do not provide all information .
&quot; the rider Metad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as P@@ 50@@ s , GPS etc. of the image . these informations are the same as in met@@ ad@@ ata @-@ side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tization . please note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on their computer , the click on the button will download and then download the photos of their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ es ; . downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures will be downloaded in an album before you delete photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired application method of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the button to download the button . the button is chosen as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is supported this , an option New download is available . these images have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ tised . in this case the new pictures have been downloaded with a star in the showcase . if you choose this option , the new pictures are downloaded only . &quot;
&quot; if you can download the buttons all or download it , a dialog will be displayed in which the text files will be displayed like normal folder . please select the list of existing albums as normal folder . then select the target album out of the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ tization came ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once , by selecting the button Del@@ ete All . if you only want to delete the button so you must select this first and delete deleted . &quot;
&quot; note that there is no possibility to restore the photos that you deleted from the camera . therefore , they should be carefully deleted if you want to delete them from the camera . if you don &apos;t want to delete them from the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly expres@@ sing name . this file may normally fall back after the photos from the camera . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was made , into the fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ rors of the image and for dat@@ ory @-@ based submission . if you use this last option , automatically a folder per day is created . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens three more options that are performed before the photos stored on the plate . the first two concern the information about the author in section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use another date format than the standard format , you can use e.g. in editing field the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . place the option Date &amp; time . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command &apos;s command . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the possibility to download the fil@@ en@@ ames in small letters . or in case case , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , used &amp; digi@@ tization ; for a photo used , is displayed below the name that the camera is stored in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame is stored and automatically used if you open the next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tization : can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to perform an automatic rotation during downloading . not all cameras make this information ready . in the section side@@ bar met@@ ad@@ ata , you can read further details of the information that has embedded your camera into the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually swit@@ ched , and if your camera does not provide this information , it lets you install the button . if you want to switch the automatic rotation , use the button Exp@@ anded and select the Autom@@ atic rotation in the bottom area of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera was informed about the date , which the photo was made available , can be downloaded for downloading . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can read what information your camera is embedded into the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually off , and in this case saves cars directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to switch this option . use the button disk @-@ based sub@@ al@@ ben at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to upload photos from her computer to your camera is the button to download . then select up@@ loading of the file sel@@ ector dialog &amp; k@@ de ; in which you can select the files you are supposed to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ tization came ; you where the images are to be loaded high . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it may be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place . not everyone uses an airplane to keep an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was done , you can access a browser which shows the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tization ; users want to loc@@ alize the location of the photos , it is good the position data of a photo with us . &quot;
&quot; the question is how to get the GPS data into the image ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 has supported many GPS data fields such as the direction , saddle and maps refer@@ enced ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post@@ processing of GPS data and pictures files with the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ Module to the geographical assignment ( manual ) and last over the manual input of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recip@@ ients to work together . either as map module or by sending the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS @-@ interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you need to store this data in the g@@ p@@ x format since this is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract data from images and GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itu@@ dinal and l@@ ati@@ tudes or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the hall@@ mark of the coordinates , which can be created for example by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ googl@@ e.com does not show European roads . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; try to give you as much control over your work processes as possible . there are many settings that came to the behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization ; you have to switch to these settings , select in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; select action can be set on built @-@ in preview or image processing . they therefore attach the standard behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization ; however , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardization identity and the legal data . these data are automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is selected in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author is a syn@@ onym for editor : this field should contain the profession @-@ drawing of the photographer . these can be design@@ ations like an employee photographer , fre@@ el@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description of the author , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for vendors : use this field to specify which the photo offers . this must not be the author , as such as rep@@ ut@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , then the group or Agency should be at your disposal here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC campaigns save the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC field . this met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently included in the image and not only came in the database of &amp; digi@@ tization ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available in other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tization ; they will be imported without lost .
&quot; images stored as built @-@ in fittings ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JP@@ EG images : this synchroni@@ zes the comments that you add to your photos , using the pictures embedded in pictures . therefore , your procurement can also be viewed from other images , these are already lab@@ eled by other image . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all options for the information that appear , if the c@@ ursor in the main window above a file rests . depending on the option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tization came ; supports a number of different image formats , and some video formats . to determine which data types &amp; digi@@ tization came ; display , you can add the file enh@@ ancements of this list ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , which has no such extensions , supported by &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; the default settings can be reset once again , by pressing the button Re@@ fresh right of each category . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ escent of &amp; digi@@ tization may be set on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . however , you should only use different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can get a better view results . &quot;
&quot; by default the image processing a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can switch it here . you can switch to the tool@@ bar if you use the tool@@ bar in full mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or h@@ ghter color in the image . these colors will be set here . in the image processing this post@@ mode can be activated with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are stored in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia .
&quot; with the setting P@@ NG com@@ pression you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not decrease the image quality , as P@@ NG used a lu@@ st@@ less algorith@@ m . if you have a quick computer , you can put this value on a high com@@ pression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high com@@ pression . &quot;
with the option T@@ IF@@ F files com@@ pressing you can switch the De@@ fl@@ ate -@@ Com@@ pres@@ sion@@ sal@@ g@@ a.@@ mus for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it does not affect the image quality because the De@@ fl@@ ate algorith@@ m is working @-@ free .
&quot; with the cess@@ ation @-@ free JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can easily store up . even if you were writing the loss of quality loss and file size far better than at normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata were still not supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tization , the image processing was only a sculp@@ tor for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the standard formula is that all green pixels are identical to sensitive to ultr@@ avi@@ olet light . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option draws a little soft , elimin@@ ates but the 2x@@ 2 G@@ itter@@ ing pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD @-@ quality method . &quot;
&quot; when this option is set , the white @-@ straight the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Autom@@ atic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used only if the white cut is not set out . standard , it is a fixed color balance that has been photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting will only be supported for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that sub@@ mer@@ ged pictures in four steps will get more details in the nickname . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the standard is it the top @-@ up , so the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ capacity to catch the top of your camera . finally , the setting colors will create some unusual results , as they create the sh@@ re@@ por@@ ters in various ros@@ at@@ ches . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the nickname . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general does not come as fast as green and red . &quot; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the lack of green and red compart@@ ments from the yet not saturated blue pixel . of course , this is a question how much colour or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option re@@ constructed , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each picture individually . &quot;
&quot; put the lum@@ bar worth according to your taste . you probably need to put it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be made later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should be conservative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorith@@ m is a digital imaging process to rede@@ em a complete picture from the sub@@ t@@ onal image sensor which is made of the coloured pixel sensor . this algorith@@ m is also known as CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ construc@@ tion .
&quot; and digi@@ w came to you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . according to some tests it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorith@@ m of the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting , if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color vari@@ ance of your lenses , you can get the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , since you are carried out during the raw use . &quot;
a profile translated the color information and gives instructions such as these to be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tization ; information such as color information to translate into the other so the colors are as accurate as possible .
behaviour Ques@@ tions if a picture is opened in the image editing / colour management module with raw files .
&quot; color @-@ profile folder S@@ ick here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ tization ; exam@@ ines this folder during the start . &quot;
&quot; settings of the ICC profiles , you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to store . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later . &quot;
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are just your pictures colored not the whole screen .
&quot; the input profiles should fit to the camera producer and model that you use . not all profiles are included in the same way . currently , there are some , like Canon , which do not have any color @-@ tone or gam@@ mak@@ es@@ y . currently , d@@ w Gamma is not for con@@ versions at 16 bit depth . this means you have to perform the color mapping yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the soft @-@ proof profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your printer can be returned from one device . this is very useful when you print a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated . this could manually correct , rather than to leave on the blind algorith@@ m of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided with them for what is intended . unfortunately , there is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ officially : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profiles leaves the style to detect the target : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface that supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; sculp@@ tors and image lab@@ ours . many modules support which have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules that you want to use , and these are then loaded by &amp; digi@@ tization ; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short command for tasks , which are carried out by modules can set up in the menu under settings in short time . &quot;
&quot; for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules , you can get information about the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manual books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the sli@@ deshow should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator stops the time between the image above , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other cross @-@ edge areas turn the met@@ ad@@ ata or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera features show on the left a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button of automatic detection , which is trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . here are the portals . currently , here are the portals , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage cameras selected . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / remo@@ vable on which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you need to connect the camera with your computer , connect them to the display mode . &quot;
&quot; try out whether &amp; digi@@ tization came ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set the camera dell and port manually . after you have set your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this will be displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option of confirmation dialog for the moving of &gt; Images in the M@@ ül@@ men , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ tization ; when delet@@ ing a photos in an album . in the sections of a photo and delete an album you will find further details . &quot;
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ tization ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without any queries . otherwise you need to apply changes to the kno@@ b changes .
you can also under@@ go the display of the screen@@ portrait of &amp; digi@@ tization . this acceler@@ ates under certain circumstances the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ tization .
&quot; the setting Bei@@ m start looking for new photos are forced &amp; digi@@ tised ; the base ord@@ ner was deleted after new or deleted albums / photos ; this extends the start @-@ time of &amp; digi@@ tization . this extends the start @-@ time of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ers , asks &amp; digi@@ tization came ; you whether it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ tization ; to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings can be selected under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is enum@@ er@@ ated below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tization ; you will find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ tization came ; includes a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correction and improvement . the image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the ads .
&quot; the image processing contains a range of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tization ; therefore , they are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be set in section image processing . &quot;
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current date number , repe@@ ating factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top edge and below the tool@@ bar to quick access to the most commonly used functions .
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will have used the original photo before you save the original photo . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo any more once you have the image saved . &quot;
so you should therefore create a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file saving .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original picture by using the menu File Rec@@ restore or the kno@@ b The kno@@ b rein@@ stall the image editing in the tool@@ bar . they then lose any change that you have been performed in the photo since last time . &quot;
&quot; virtually any action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or recovered . the last action you can und@@ one by selecting editing , or recovered , by selecting processing out of the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make yourself the keyboard abbrevi@@ ation , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to make the cat@@ chy and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to recover . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; via the back @-@ running or re @-@ producing button in the tool@@ bar one moment will press a moment longer . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between also have been revers@@ ed and restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between the pictures in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navig@@ ational button in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture under or the entries in the menu . if you have any changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can use in the photo and zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the panel menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlar@@ gements factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view of full mode is displayed in full mode . you come in the normal view , in which you will use the tool@@ bar button . normally , you can change this in the creation dialog by &amp; digi@@ tization . you can view this from the &amp; digi@@ tization ; main window . see the section for placing the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the menu image and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole propositions . all images can be printed out of your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the standard method and select from the menu album . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to meet your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which is important information and promotions available for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , even in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders clicks . &quot;
&quot; multi@@ f@@ aches clicking on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear , or again disappear into the edge . &quot;
&quot; in the lab@@ eling view , you can insert lab@@ eling with unlimited size or insert . note the remark below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to be copied into the EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data only support ASC@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut down to 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC certification field in other applications , you should be aware of these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you commented there , you can use either the button or simply change the next image , the complaint are then saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the use button , there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also use the met@@ ad@@ ata to write files into the files . however , this is always done when you choose a met@@ ad@@ ata settings that will always be written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the section review shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Su@@ chen and Sor@@ ti@@ zations . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar , or with the keyboard abbrevi@@ ation C@@ g + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select this and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
&quot; the keywords indicates a search box to the filters of the keywords , the sampling tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ tization ; session sho@@ cked the key@@ word . &quot;
the sampling tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the given search engines . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word quickly . this ability is especially useful when you have many key@@ word .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering the key@@ word in a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for fast access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by mark@@ ings of the corresponding attachment fields in the tree . all of the tags of an image are stored into the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; selecting multiple images in the main view , and select a key@@ word in the key@@ note tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , please refer to the key@@ word filter section . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar sampling filter is used to change the selection of the displayed images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - fil@@ um , sampling and search engines is used , only the inter@@ sections of this two are displayed . all listed keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw up and lay down . suppose you have selected multiple images in order to pull you with key@@ ed . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put on the selection . then , a dialog will be asked if you want to use the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the sampling filter is reduced to one key@@ word . you have been selected with Str@@ g + a , and afterwards a key@@ word was drawn from the right sampling tree on the selection and stored there . a dialog will be asked if this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be swit@@ ched under settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be one or be , you can easily change this with a double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; 1 ) : entry to the database is sought after in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ note , etc . &quot;
&quot; 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can choose a Exten@@ ded search over all the elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need to use the cross @-@ box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then see as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly got to digi@@ tization ; s concrete implementation adapted .
&quot; the reason why you have a colour@@ less work@@ flow is that the colors available from your camera or scanner , you can reach that colors available on your monitor those of your camera or scanner the same and the colors you print or publish in the web of which you will publish them from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the topic on color administration comes , everyone would like to know what buttons must press for the results which he wants . unfortunately , the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with adequate background information about colour management . in addition to you , links with deeper information enable you to make your own informed decisions to make you obtain the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your work@@ work@@ flow meets all six below criteria , then you do not have to worry about colour management . &quot;
they work on a monitor of the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum . ( more information can be found below )
their only other images are via e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is .
&quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should you use a different color room and thus have to worry about colour managers ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors that we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ sol@@ ation @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some bigger colors , then visit Bruce Lin@@ d@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and then click on Info and then to information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
must I calibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , as s@@ R@@ GB , you need to work your monitor k@@ alli@@ bri@@ an , as s@@ R@@ GB of it , closes the circle . if you are working as in the Far@@ br@@ aum of s@@ R@@ GB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , you need to use your monitor to the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a pass@@ able profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , paragrap@@ hs Ab@@ same and contrast , from the menu Kor@@ rigi@@ d Autom@@ atic correction are automatically trying to make your colors the best . you will need to experiment with these effects , to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method scal@@ able the lumin@@ escent point of black and the bri@@ gh@@ test point as bright as possible , without its colour sh@@ aded . this function is often a magnetic correction for images the dark or adult . &quot;
&quot; un@@ equal : this method j@@ us@@ fies the illumin@@ ator of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ og@@ ram of the Inten@@ tion is as flat as possible . sometimes , the very good results achieved in the improvement of the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful surgery which can either be caused by a picture or destroyed it . &quot;
&quot; automatic shut@@ ters : this method maxim@@ ises the color range in the red , green and blue canal . you will find the dark and bright border @-@ tones and j@@ us@@ zed the red , green@@ - and blue @-@ channels on the entire hist@@ ograms area . &quot;
contrast to contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image through the move of the lowest and highest value on the greatest possible range and a new generation of all values in between . this is only visible in full images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
&quot; the white @-@ straight away from &amp; digi@@ tization ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ straight photos . &quot;
&quot; the white @-@ straight @-@ correction is slightly limited because over a color foam with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you can go far from the original picture , which works in the blank mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode works , so your ways are to be better off . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white balance sheet of the copyright of P@@ aw@@ el T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you start it over the menu item , white white items identical to the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the anter@@ oom can be adjusted to the size . on the left , both the original picture and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynam@@ ically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white straight away , then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the audience has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ og@@ ram .
&quot; right up there will be an hist@@ og@@ ram shown that dynamic as you change a parameter . this hist@@ og@@ ram is very helpful there , even in well illuminated pictures , most pixels very small lum@@ bar levels . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow of the shadow lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even down . &quot;
&quot; as a stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature Pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere to the picture view on the calculation of color temperature of the white balance . this type of color will also set the temperature and green values automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white comparison with the list of settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ se@@ aling indicators increases the colors when more than a colour channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. you will be shown the combined result in the white version . this is shown in the preview as r@@ an indicator and has no effect on the final image .
buttons save as and store just this . each setting of the white balance you set may have to save you in a text file and later load it later .
&quot; the kno@@ b preferences set all the filter values again on their default values and the associated white white balance . please note that , neutral settings are a different photo as your original . if you save it , your original picture will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can set here the codi@@ les per colour channel of the mach@@ ined image . 8 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality pictures . this coding requires also more record , processing time and stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of colour pro@@ fil@@ tration . color mapping can be performed by the sig@@ natur@@ es for the use of colour pro@@ filing , you can rate the chapter color administration . &quot;
another important tool is to be found in the menu under colours audio @-@ correction . this tool provides an integrated way to use multiple colour channels at the same time . this is helpful when your camera or scanner always need the same error and therefore you always need the same correction . in the manual for audio @-@ correction you will find more information .
a very powerful opportunity to correct problems is the tool for gr@@ ad@@ ation that you can find under colors Gr@@ ad@@ ation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; tool Far@@ be@@ ff@@ effects introduces you four color effects , a solar energy effect , a bicycle filter effect , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ een filter available . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of the painting . the colored areas shel@@ tered out of the additional light . this had the effect that the ligh@@ tening areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second light . this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what chemical is possible . another increase will eventually create a negative picture that is not to be found on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of solar energy efficiency . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processes ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the vi@@ vid filters simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contrast , that he makes a stronger contr@@ ast@@ effect that makes the colors brilliant and smooth@@ ing . try it simply , it em@@ bell@@ ished a lot of photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on day@@ light , the name is created by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are also a few phot@@ ograph@@ s , especially those that hardly mar@@ vel@@ ous landscapes , too much . &quot;
the ne@@ on@@ filter si@@ zing ne@@ on@@ light on the contr@@ asts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide re@@ ps the strength of the ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . at large pictures the filter may exp@@ ose the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the color contr@@ asts and to correct the lumin@@ osity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all of your judicial options can be seen in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you are used .
&quot; if you can get a photo with bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a good choice to reduce the satur@@ ation instead of increasing them . all changes you can perform in the preview . if Him would like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool Gr@@ ad@@ ation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma is the tool of key correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated , you need only the area of sli@@ der to explain just the area of sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ og@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a grap@@ hing of the intensity values , an hist@@ og@@ ram , the active channel , or the selected area . under the graphs are three sli@@ ders into the cli@@ cked and the move can change to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to postp@@ one the Reg@@ ulators and look forward to seeing how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right hand , the original and the preview of the image can be considered . the preview is dynam@@ ically based on the settings of the picture , updated . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set whether the hist@@ og@@ ram can be displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for pictures of a constant colour , the linear hist@@ og@@ ram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ age is useful . &quot;
&quot; three regul@@ ators : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle t@@ ints , frequently used gam@@ ma values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ ec@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original image , to automatically paint the input values of the shadow , middle and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic protection . &quot;
&quot; output levels : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each sector . there are also two regul@@ ators to change the output levels , e.g. to create the output levels , e.g. to create a well @-@ known image as a background , while to see something else in the foreground . &quot;
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and loading : with these buttons can be saved in the file system and later loaded again . it will use the Gimp levels format .
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color chains , the input values will be automatically re@@ mun@@ er@@ ted for all shadows , means and Sundays that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for rotation , green@@ - , blu@@ epr@@ int and the lum@@ bar channels . &quot;
&quot; the option of over@@ se@@ aling indicators controls all color channels to display over@@ loaded pixel and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of the judicial values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as output levels are unchanged . the original picture is with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the origin@@ als and the target image is displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modifications channel : this selection box allows the channel to indicate which is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this cas@@ ket there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures that have been taken with a digital camera . for pictures with large areas of a constant colour , the linear mode creates a broad range . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will continue . &quot;
&quot; if you add a cur@@ v@@ ator to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones with a dar@@ ker menu of Cor@@ respon@@ dent and that the associated image dar@@ ker will be dar@@ ker . &quot;
on the preview of the original photos is a red marking to see . if you want to change this mark@@ ings on the area you want to change the original value . create a point on this line and move it on and down until the value after your taste .
save as and loading : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each bend that you created can be saved in the file system and later loaded . the file format is the Gimp cur@@ vy format .
&quot; if you are using this method and the three color buttons automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sun @-@ t@@ ints that you want to use and click the original image to set the check@@ points for the red , green , blu@@ epr@@ int , and lum@@ bar curve . &quot;
&quot; the option of over@@ se@@ aling indicators controls all color channels to display over@@ loaded pixel . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result . here is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ous canal . shadow and Sundays were used with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tions ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ er of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the colour shades of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er of the image processing .
with the channel @-@ op@@ tionally box you can select the color for the hist@@ og@@ ram : this gives you a first reference how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed compared to its own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture appears a vertical line in the hist@@ og@@ ram to show you the appropriate colour value .
&quot; controls for the module are right down : shelves for Red , Green and Construction allow you to preserve this channels , as the channel mix@@ er then maintain the general brightness as well as the channel mix@@ er then retain the tool tool to generate great black @-@ white con@@ versions of your photos . try to reduce the green canal for black @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Monoch@@ rome , the reduction of a color comes into a visible smoke that comes from the colour@@ ing . colour@@ ing consists of small spac@@ ecraft in any channel different . if that &apos;s the case you can improve your Monoch@@ rome conversion to improve in which you will reduce the colour@@ ing first . &quot;
saving as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any mix@@ er setting can be saved for later and then load it . the used file format is the Gimp channel mix@@ er format .
&quot; the option of over@@ se@@ aling indicators controls all color channels to display over@@ loaded pixel and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel is re@@ constructed . the option L@@ umin@@ ity is activated . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the edited image under ( 2 ) .
black / White photography was always fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography is black / White a working ride because color pictures can be converted easily on the computer . also with a set of film rolls profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white movie filter with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scenarios and fits especially good to portraits against heaven . so similar to the 00@@ 4 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Green@@ filter . &quot;
Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter : simul@@ ates a black / white movie filter with a or@@ acle Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air @-@ photos . therefore similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) orange @-@ fil@@ tered . &quot;
rot@@ ect : simul@@ ates a black / white movie filter with a red lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates dram@@ ati@@ cal effects and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ shore at the time @-@ time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white movie filter with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) joint filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and middle t@@ ints while he adds a little cold in the loop . this is very similar to the process of a print and re@@ formation in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; using the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool texture , you can apply decorative textures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a screen , a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a wall screen on a wall . the menu application is used to use the image processing can be used for it . &quot;
Rel@@ ief : move this parameter to the right increases the ascent of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the image .
a paper text effect is applied in the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping an eye on the limits of a photos is not an easy task . it is an opportunity to keep his attention to the image . this is a psych@@ ologic barrier for the stre@@ aming eye . under image frame the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter you put the desired quick yp for your image . all around the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce enclosed with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , de@@ du@@ ce it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button @-@ piece and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value area for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image with the frame is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the pressure of the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after page ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can insert a single @-@ format text into an image at any time . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it using the mouse . use the image size , the bigger the character set . you will simply enter a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ clear background . already , the image is ready . &quot;
&quot; every setting that you have chosen for your text , you can press for your text , until you press the button OK , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool sten@@ cil , you can use a sten@@ cil over a picture . &quot;
the menu picture pattern can be used in the image processing can be used to sten@@ cils sten@@ cils on a picture .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format ( 9 ) to the reduction of the file size of the sten@@ cil . if you want to add your sten@@ cil ( 9 ) to the reduction of the file size of the sten@@ cil , so simply send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ tization ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ tization came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use this tool for the first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil with the kno@@ b base folder in dialogue . select the folder in which you get the sten@@ cil copies . these settings will be painted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root @-@ ord@@ ner for the sten@@ cils , a construction super@@ visor appears to re @-@ reflected the folder structure of the sten@@ cil &apos;s folder . selecting a folder is updated the templates of sten@@ cils automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image . &quot;
&quot; enlarge : this button enlarged the following image . it is centered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you want to change the position of the mouse . in case you want to apply the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the sten@@ cil on the whole image , you need to use the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to shift that under the sten@@ cil picture . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the sten@@ cil on your image . the picture will then be customized to the size .
&amp; digi@@ tization came ; three different tools available to the har@@ ps . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for har@@ ps . it is very fast and simple , but , especially in dark areas , gr@@ acious images . &quot;
un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture tough@@ er . in fact it is not a bit like it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken out of Gimp and he is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Win@@ ston Chang .
reaction is possibly the best of the three because he really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters to adapt .
&quot; photos without a focus as well as most digi@@ tised images need to put together a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this , in turn , causes a little vulnerable to a colour point . the same phenomenon can be observed if colour points are printed on paper . SLR cameras usually need more subsequent sc@@ oring as normal cameras for the private user . &quot;
&quot; with JP@@ EG images , often a camera internal sc@@ ure has been applied . images in the resource format , must always be used in processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner turn a sc@@ arf already during the reading of the image . if you de@@ activate this , you get control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you can obtain additional results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the sharp@@ ens procedure . this allows you to call the menu of the menu .
&quot; but you should hereby handle cau@@ tious , since the results are not very natural : the har@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fy the noise . in general , the appropriate technology is to re@@ focus on the tool . you can also find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharp@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : one image is too cr@@ acking . the solution , the image is a little soft to draw , is much easier than it to shar@@ k . use the tool for soft@@ marks with the menu supplement cor@@ rigi@@ d soft , and experimenting with settings . the showcase on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter is bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help edit the image . the showcase of the filter shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should first check out the effect . if you make the in@@ sharp@@ ness mask too strong , cra@@ ving and the impression of gr@@ ats will produce close to sharp edges . &quot;
the radius represents a how many pixels on each page are affected by the filters . high @-@ res images allow greater radi@@ i . they should therefore raise pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the original image is added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the Corpor@@ a is a break from the maximum R@@ GB value and to use the difference . you can thus use a minimum difference thus for a channel of filter is applied . in this way , areas will be avoided with a soft change between the tones of sharp@@ ness and therefore beauty faul@@ ts in faces , cel@@ esti@@ cks and water surfaces . &quot;
this is an example of the un@@ sharp filter filters . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a corpor@@ a = 0.0 . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; tool re@@ focused on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ protected un@@ f@@ alt@@ ation filter algorith@@ m of Ernst Li@@ ppe . &quot;
this tool is trying to use a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ ussed on . this is better approach than trying to raise the photo . it is using a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters . use the traditional technique for the sharp@@ ness of images is the use of an un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask . they can run it out of the menu by using colors Re@@ foc@@ us@@ sing in the image processing .
&quot; in practice the circular catch is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung is a very long tail , which goes far from the original pixel size . the F@@ IR Wiener in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen F@@ altung is even influenced by the distant pixel . this causes unwanted results . &quot;
&quot; circular loop : this is the radius of circular flow . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures , it is possible to put a higher value if your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red if your image should be very bl@@ ur@@ red however . &quot;
&quot; cor@@ relation : a increase in the cor@@ relation can help to reduce art@@ e@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.95 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ ly effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; Rau@@ sch@@ filter : an increase in the smo@@ k@@ filter can help you reduce art@@ e@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 is very helpful . however , values higher than 0.1 is very bad . a reasonable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will still be mer@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe . in most cases , you should use this value to zero to annoying art@@ e@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , so you may also have to increase the cor@@ relation and / o@@ der@@ den smo@@ k@@ filter . &quot;
&quot; total size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ational size . however , a increase in mattress size can produce good results , especially if you choose great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen archipelago . however , note that the module is very slow if you choose great values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
saving as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any re@@ foc@@ us@@ sing parameters that you set will have set it later and can then be loaded for later .
&quot; try all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much surger@@ ies changes that are not immediately visible , but later left in@@ convenient arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you are reading pictures and com@@ press , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to un@@ com@@ pressed image . &quot;
generally produces bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king better results as a scar@@ ce . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood as sharp@@ ens .
&quot; theoretically , it needs to be bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king and generate art@@ e@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of in@@ sharp@@ ness . for the Vienna Filter one can never show the effect of the F@@ IR filter . practically , the F@@ IR filter filter is often better in processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between different filters , in a small un@@ focused picture , see : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture must be corrected . this picture was done with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light to the auto @-@ focus lens .
&quot; for more information about the methods of sharp@@ ness in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
&quot; the Reg@@ ular Gl@@ ät@@ te puts the in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed of the area , in order to generate a natural p@@ up@@ ille . &quot;
&quot; the colour tin@@ ent allows an adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you wish blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here . &quot;
the tool error correction is one of the most developed tool to not remove the desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ struc@@ algorith@@ m was developed from the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g @-@ Project .
this tool contains different settings as star@@ points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are enum@@ er@@ ated below :
if you want to use the filter settings f@@ ake you can use the rider smooth@@ ing and advanced settings .
&quot; detail@@ ing p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to a uniform glass smooth@@ ing about the image . however , a value of 0,@@ 9 should receive details so that no sharp@@ ness should be necessary . note , please note that the detail@@ ing always should be ordered . &quot;
&quot; jud@@ ging Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es even@@ ly in all directions , while a value close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a fil@@ gr@@ itt or C@@ CD Rau@@ schen will produce a high value @-@ similar patterns . JP@@ EG art@@ e@@ facts are best placed at a value close to 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum smooth@@ ing factor over all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . put this value to the degree of smoking in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this figure is necessary , as it is difficult if you want to generate a lot of noise , as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
re@@ petition : returns to how often the algorith@@ m is going through . normally here 1 or 2 .
&quot; Win@@ kel@@ gradual page &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ en Alpha . in case of Alpha small , it should also be small to create that small angle create a long term . you should therefore choose this value as much possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integr@@ ates &#91; 0.1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ ical st@@ ints in pixels . you should put the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More about quality that you receive by selecting this option is only small . he has doubled the term . we therefore recommend it to him .
buttons Save as and loading exactly this . every setting of image faul@@ ts can be saved into a text file and later be loaded later .
&quot; image error is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take very long and a high CPU load after you . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b break@@ down . &quot;
&quot; below you can see how image faul@@ ts with small art@@ e@@ facts can be removed . the module is displayed on a photo that is caused in Guatemala City with an an@@ alogue camera . as you see , there is a peculi@@ ar black arti@@ fact that caused by a bad film storage while the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; Rau@@ sch@@ reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce images . it uses a copy@@ protected algorith@@ m of Peter H@@ eck@@ ert . &quot;
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable sculp@@ filter available to remove spots and other art@@ e@@ facts , e.g. by dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ th@@ ier ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensors using digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screens@@ hot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ting noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings may remain in the default settings . &quot;
radius controls the window size of 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the amount of filter per pixel and can dis@@ agree the image via the image and the colour in it and thus fixes the smaller mistakes .
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the pix@@ el@@ ude to determine the filter down@@ side . if it will be increased , smo@@ k@@ pointed switch off . you may need to change the edges filter . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details does not get more and smo@@ other or lubric@@ ate again . &quot;
edges : controls the tak@@ eover of the filter . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not occur the whole smo@@ ker or smo@@ k@@ ets can occur . put it on a value close to the max@@ im if you want to remove a sh@@ aking smoking or JP@@ EG @-@ art@@ e@@ facts without losing details .
&quot; lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance intoler@@ ance of the picture . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change , to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the details of the details . &quot;
color : controls the color @-@ toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the details of the details .
Gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ anc@@ ers of the dark areas which typically are more tricky to increase . he also mer@@ ged the shadow ranges .
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the judicial system of phosph@@ ors . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius of variations of illumin@@ ant . if he is increasing , the edges gl@@ at@@ ters can occur . he can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter at the edges . he can remove noise and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
&quot; store and load : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for smokers , which you have set , can be saved in the file system and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) , and the correc@@ ting with ( 2 ) . the ru@@ ction reduction was applied with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; sometimes a picture is too scar@@ ring for your purpose . the solution , the image is a little soft to draw , is fortunately much easier than one image to shar@@ ks and experiment with the menu . use the effect on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease phot@@ og@@ ef@@ oot .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts of your pictures . it is very well adapted to dive Gau@@ ß &apos;s cra@@ ving , scrat@@ ches , com@@ pression , com@@ pres@@ sive images and thus receives the content as it also makes the human eye . &quot;
&quot; same algorith@@ m may be used for color and textures . the text box is used with a different tool , the error correction , carried out by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce : the com@@ pression of JP@@ EG is not perfect in some areas even very far away . as a lu@@ sty com@@ pres@@ sive com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ism he generates some com@@ pression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts . this setting should correct this problem .
buttons Save as and loading exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later be loaded later .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take very long and a high CPU load after you . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
below you can cut down like a photo with par@@ ade@@ mig@@ es smo@@ ker .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the ber@@ ed movie gr@@ itt on the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ting below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time the textures was reduced to an old color photo which was created with a scanner . the original picture is seen below ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove hot@@ pixel of photos with a C@@ CD camera , eight were to be removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project that are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , tot@@ e or hot pixel are especially high at high quality raw material Mode photos a problem , since many cameras with JP@@ EG com@@ pression over an embedded oppression of hot pixel . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; name Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ screen method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark . the tool will see automatic the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the picture show .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can discover the dark picture right next to new hot or bright pixel by C@@ CD defect . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correct image . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark picture and automatically loads it in the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result . the default column shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are taken out in all cases .
choose an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing this pix@@ el@@ blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; Dur@@ ing : it will be an average of neighbouring pixel . the resulting colour is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels on the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels which have a distance of 1 from Pix@@ el@@ block are used to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear pixel ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixels on the block .
square : this is the default method of method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pix@@ el@@ block will be de@@ duc@@ ted to calculate a bi square surface ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that will then use the pixels on the block .
Cub@@ an : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be pulled to calculate a bi @-@ cube surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an pixels on the block to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
&quot; below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to be applied . the original picture was enlarged at 300 % ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive image is under ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ fier correction is a tool to correct the Vign@@ et@@ ting , i.e. under@@ laid corners , one image to correct . &quot;
&quot; for@@ d@@ angle objective , especially the light and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ate the whole range of sensor . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) them the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . Tele@@ objective show under circumstances also this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he also has dis@@ advantages . many Center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at Bl@@ ending filter , which should keep the necessary wear time under circumstances which it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . &quot;
&quot; with the large loading areas of today &apos;s fil@@ tration and colour scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by using a qui@@ val@@ ents to trans@@ forms the transformation with a Center@@ filter on a picture . the algorith@@ m is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the correct correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light enh@@ ances at the point of the greatest density that filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , what a optical filter with a bl@@ ending adjustment of 1 , or acci@@ dental filter to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of Vign@@ et@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : the editing of an image with the Vign@@ et@@ ting correc@@ tions decreases the lumin@@ osity of the target with these options . however , the controller must provide you with positive values , as you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine re@@ mun@@ eration of the target image , so let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gr@@ ad@@ ation from the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing from the menu color Gr@@ ad@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the Vign@@ ti@@ tious correction to a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the correc@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correc@@ tive image . a lumin@@ ous and contr@@ ast@@ ed correction was also carried out in the image with this tool . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; Lin@@ sen@@ distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses to photos . it uses a copy@@ protected algorith@@ m of David Ho@@ dson . &quot;
&quot; this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colored distor@@ tions , cannot be corrected using this tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient of the second gr@@ ades treated the general geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ able form of the image .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third gr@@ ades has a similar round @-@ effect , fl@@ acht but at the edges . this correction is not used in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth gr@@ ades corrected the remote corners opposite to the second gr@@ ades . if you combine these two can be eliminated any geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion virtually eliminated .
&quot; generally , this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second gr@@ ades . with negative values can be corrected , mid@@ ated distor@@ tions are corrected and positive values of kis@@ sed distor@@ tion . &quot;
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth gr@@ ades . this value appears stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameters used the sign of the parameter .
z@@ oom : this value is scal@@ ded the image size and thus leads to the correction first di@@ ades through . negative values enlarge while positive the image distor@@ ted .
&quot; bright : this value j@@ us@@ hed the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image into the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialogue with a preview the distor@@ tion correction . the values which you use for your image will be saved and used at the next start as standard values . &quot;
&quot; the tonn@@ or kis@@ ses @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all the cutting or size changes . in case you can re@@ cut this correction as all the first . if you have a picture new to cut and then perform a heavy @-@ shaped correction , the effect of the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction and provide you this tool a vertical and horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the marine edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in connection , you can fix the tonn@@ ages / kis@@ ses with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a ho@@ ver@@ ous distor@@ tion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can transform them with the cutting @-@ tool in the menu , trans@@ forming the image processing or over the z@@ oom Reg@@ ulators of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures extends the heavy @-@ shaped correction . the next logical step for some motives , such as recordings from the front , frame and painting , it is the perspective to correct all angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the heavy @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorith@@ m is based on a method of simul@@ ating infr@@ ared @-@ film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org web page that can be accessed by this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ i@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters set up film gr@@ itt and film @-@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . activ@@ ates the option of film texture and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; since the filter color channels used to produce infr@@ ared film , especially the green channel , there is no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , since the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ ared fil@@ me@@ ff@@ ek@@ tes applied to an Land@@ scape photo from New Zealand . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the top .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; filter film gran@@ ting is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce film gran@@ ularity , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturer of great sil@@ k@@ ets of the photo@@ em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film maker gives your photo a certain mood or appears to move back into the past . if you want to get this particular , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight specifically to your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the Kör@@ ner k@@ ali@@ bri@@ des . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more bas@@ k@@ ner , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film drive to a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the used ( 2 ) . the used film @-@ hyper@@ sensitivity to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and nursing are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to affect this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five out . th@@ icker brushes are better suited for large pictures . smooth@@ ing controls the smooth@@ ing or , from the other side , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ining is marked with the ( 2 ) . twe@@ et size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and Gl@@ ät@@ te 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to generate a K@@ ohl@@ esk@@ iz@@ ze . therefore , images whose gra@@ dient are slow to change . it &apos;s helpful if you would like to imagine which scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ating you . this would be good pictures to begin with . &quot;
&quot; there are two shelves with a value area of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regul@@ ator select the bull &apos;s size and the lower j@@ us@@ hed the contrast , respectively . &quot;
this is an example of the cohesion filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adapting the Inten@@ sity .
&quot; the engra@@ ving came ; filter engra@@ ving in 3 @-@ D , as if it was set up in wax . it uses a copy@@ protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important on the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ed landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast to the filter@@ ing . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the original image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ tions . it is used by copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave blocks 1 : shares the image into cells and lets it look as if it is seen by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wav@@ e@@ blocks 1 is distor@@ ted the image here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can break these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of in@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
z@@ oom un@@ sharp@@ ness : dil@@ utes the image along ster@@ n@@ fo@@ er@@ ers lines set off by a center . this simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness to see a zo@@ om@@ ous camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ ale Un@@ sharp@@ ness : knowing the image through rotation of the pixels by a centre . this simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a revol@@ ving camera .
remo@@ ves the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; freedom of movement : know the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera . &quot;
sof@@ tening un@@ sharp@@ ness : dil@@ uted the image soft into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and sh@@ iny soft focus ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
sho@@ ok : knowing the image through random dis@@ shift of the pixels and simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a random moving camera .
intelligent un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the color @-@ bas@@ ins in the picture and bl@@ amed it without change the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo into rectangular cells and then created it , by filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es are a nice small tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your image . this gives it natural your images a n@@ asses appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m .
&quot; dri@@ p size allows it to change the size of the drop . as the tro@@ pe size does not automatically increase the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and the density of drops . fishing changes the op@@ tic effect of the drop on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can hold with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing an area free of rain drops . use the tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that will be free to choose . if you then start the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es , the area will remain free from shelves . &quot;
this is an example of rain drops . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or rotating in the right orientation . the tools can be transformed in the menu or transform them into the menu . &quot;
photo magni@@ fied is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is easy . the big question is , how can you keep an image , and the details are sharp ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you see the missing information again , here is a good job . try him and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can change it on the desired size with the tool size . select size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below . &quot;
&quot; the tool used to change the size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation@@ method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; many imaging programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation on the enlarge of an image . &amp; digi@@ tization has been using a further developed approach . the underlying algorith@@ m Photo auf@@ bl@@ ases was developed from the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you have to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New Size and are listed below :
&quot; default ratio : if this setting is enabled , the entry of the new size is maintained by the original image of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this figure is necessary , as it is difficult if you want to generate a lot of noise , as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effects , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
buttons saving as and loading are used precisely to enlarge . each single @-@ set for photo can be saved as a text file and later be loaded later .
&quot; photo shooting is very fast with what it does , but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after you . you can break the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
&quot; you can see below for photo above , by adding a small color picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear default enlargement to comparison . &quot;
&quot; cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a commonly under@@ estimated tool to get a picture by pressing the mouse button , by pressing the mouse button and draw the rect@@ angle , then you &apos;ll see this rect@@ angle then you &apos;ll see the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would be cut down . you can draw the size of the rect@@ angle area by moving on the corners of the rect@@ angle . just create a new rect@@ angle by clicking the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting edge , use the button button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file to save or save file under the menu to save the newly released photo . &quot;
&quot; in the fores@@ try area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in dialogue . &quot;
&quot; in the tool after aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool after aspect ratio is using a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you can use inches , intro@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see e.g. below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to detect the choice automatically horizontal or ver@@ tically .
&quot; bottom in the dialog , you can use the Max . relationship button to cut the area for access to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation ( horiz@@ ont@@ ally or vertical ) , these settings are displayed as standard values depending on the orientation . the modified image measurements are displayed in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the assem@@ blies will allow help to help , so that you are better together to get your images better . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ic ponds are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third party , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are an opportunity to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles . &quot;
&quot; golden middle : the golden middle is a partition that is on different natural growth pattern , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy , or the bl@@ ender blades of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all the possible things we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians , and Greeks used to give your temple and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i eps . 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where every number is the golden middle . a composition that usually follows is considered vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious . &quot;
the golden middle makes liquid relief lines at your disposal if you put together a picture . these help are enum@@ er@@ ated down :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results to achieve good results for your photos . compared to third party rain , the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye along the line of the spiral , and creates a symmet@@ rical flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule are called the right angles of the golden spiral , also known as golden spiral . it should be something that the eye can be in the center of the composition . it can be a line or different objects . this one can simply be there without the eye to guide it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles are also leading up from the above golden spiral . you are aware that in contrast to harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal to these lines . di@@ agon@@ ale can be placed on these lines , a static object can be published . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect of professional phot@@ ograp@@ hen dynamic Sy@@ mmet@@ ry . try your image batteries at one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition you cannot achieve differently . &quot;
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ ally mirror and Ver@@ tical reflect can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic ponds .
&quot; with the button of button , you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have an image with a lot of colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image around any angle .
if you make a photo then it happens easily that you are not exactly ver@@ tically or horizontal . this creates a picture in which the things turned into an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image editing and the tool free rotation . choose this free rotation and j@@ us@@ ze the target angle .
&quot; turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are shown in degree . with the button pres@@ et , you can put the slide back to 0 degree . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the Module Free Rot@@ ation provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse button in the picture show around the two lines , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now j@@ us@@ ze the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
once you filmed a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix it is to transform it the function trans@@ forming from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is an automatic assignment . choose one of the following options :
&quot; the option of anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation , but take note of the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ v@@ ative transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog box you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left bottom : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adapting the perspective the image becomes a bit w@@ aging . for single adaptation , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after having requested the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes on the corners . a way to rep@@ licate it is to cut the picture with trans@@ forming the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool system is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is no rotation , the image is distor@@ ted . in other words , a rect@@ angle turns into a parall@@ el@@ og@@ ram . you can transform this module through transform@@ able sc@@ iss@@ ors . &quot;
make your picture by using the horiz@@ ont@@ als angle and the vertical angle . you can push horiz@@ ont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the preview .
&quot; to your help will be a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool system to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the lam@@ ination , the image will be a bit confused . for a single shot , this effect is usually neglected , but two verti@@ ces are twice as much bl@@ iter@@ ation and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
after the grin@@ ding has the image un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with trans@@ forming the image processing .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tization came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries comp@@ ili@@ es are used . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all files available on their system available file formats . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and T@@ IF@@ F . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; displays only files in formats to know . this happens on the file extension and a comparison of this with a defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file contained in the list will display &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section configuration you will find more information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras will allow you to select the format you need . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports both formats .
image com@@ pression is the application of data com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ists on digital images . thereby redund@@ ant information is reduced to store the image data on a efficient way .
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , gl@@ atter@@ y results as JP@@ EG with the same com@@ pres@@ sive dis@@ proportion@@ ate . the 200@@ 0s version can also be processed if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the resource format , you can read about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format pictures in JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F with the raw @-@ converter of &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tization came ; supports the store of raw materials only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is included in &amp; digi@@ tization . all the cameras can see below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats that came from &amp; digi@@ tization ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in Avi@@ - or MPEG @-@ format ; however , there is not a film processing program and therefore does not have built @-@ built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ tization ; settings to play movies to play the program to play back . &quot;

K@@ IP@@ I module is exported to a range of images in a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth .
&quot; if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 what you can do well if the initi@@ ale contrast already was very good , then you can perform the first four judicial system with the module white . &quot;
many tools you need the photographic record are included in &amp; digi@@ tization ; your description will follow here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as har@@ ps , soft@@ ness , rou@@ ghs , dis@@ foc@@ us@@ sing , un@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that is applied to the effect in a preview . below you can see &quot; texture &quot; ) ; in this dialogue : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progression @-@ beam shows the status of the filter on the current image . links from him allow five buttons to change the comparison smo@@ ked of the fores@@ ees . these modes are :
ver@@ tically share without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected equ@@ itable area .
horizontal share without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower displays the filter applied to the area below the selected range .
ver@@ tically split . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal share . the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays the preview when the mouse is not in the sitting area , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can switch to show over@@ - and under@@ p@@ ation . the colours available can be adapted in the general introduction .
( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of the P@@ review . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and on the part of the picture you want to preview . the preview in the left part of dialogue will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all settings vary from the last use of the module .
the side@@ bar characteristics shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained by itself . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : displays a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider is an intuitive map search engines available on the Mar@@ ble @-@ mini program . you can drag the mouse button or drag and move it . move it during the left mouse button . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this requires your pictures ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and to choose and use colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files , which are of &amp; k@@ de ; installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and un@@ used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder to files . &quot;
the c@@ ursor is displayed in the pall@@ et view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it displays on the color next . the color is described below the pall@@ et view . here also the colour name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to choose out . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the c@@ ursor to move . then move the mouse with penet@@ rated left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the cross panel is adding c@@ ursor to the button , the color is inserted from the color panel at the c@@ ursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode transm@@ itter was selected . this mode can set you by writing the cross @-@ box under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the promotions , cut and inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; used the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each colour three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a po@@ len@@ ght sign , if another color follows , can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the colours can be with@@ drawn with the mouse .
you can choose a color somewhere on the screen and then select in the color box on the left .
&quot; there is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in science , especially in inform@@ atics . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; -@@ program to visu@@ alize graphs . so far , there were no modern &amp; GUI ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions . &quot;
&quot; this project has set itself the aim of replacing these programmes by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de , program . &quot;
&amp; graphical viewer ; is a KDE program for the viewing of &amp; graphical ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; shows grap@@ hing with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; programme in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graphs in &amp; Kate ; the graphs are re@@ counting and in &amp; graphical viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; Kate ; to open or the graphs in &amp; graphical viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; component to open
charging large graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than these knots )
&quot; further required software : &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; programme , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs are required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . at the beginning , if you start to open the tool@@ bar only like in the bottom screens@@ hot . in this case contains the tool@@ bar only open the symbol file , and the ( empty ) list Fin@@ ally opened files . click on the first icon to view the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot file , the main window looks like in the bottom of the screens@@ hot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is bigger than the string . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; using the mouse wheel ( high and r@@ under without special ta@@ sts , left and right at penet@@ rated &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file has just been modified in &amp; graphic viewer ; downloaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ graphical viewer ; see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a Graph@@ ite outside a running &amp; graphic viewer ; an instance open , in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice to open whether you want to open a new &amp; graphic inter@@ viewer ; the instance , or want to present the graphs in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change this with the registration dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the program start , you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph on several pages is to be split . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphs that are to be placed on a page , the side ratio will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
Road@@ show with one on several pages shared graph without head@@ line and with a different font
&quot; the page again shop gives the opportunity to set the behavior if a file has changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program each time . &quot;
&quot; the page opens the opportunity to set out the behaviour of &amp; graphical viewer ; you can set a default behavior for this case ( or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time is asked . &quot;
&quot; the site management gives the opportunity to set up the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session open or not ) , or to determine when they are asked for each start . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears on a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ I , opens up further options : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose among different &amp; graphical design ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms , select the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; Graphi@@ vi@@ z ; are : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dot ; -@@ algorith@@ m , the standard for targeted grap@@ hing . he produces hierarch@@ ical or se@@ ated represent@@ ations of the grap@@ hed graphs . the algorith@@ m puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few cant@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Ne@@ ato ; algorith@@ m is the standard for un@@ coated graphs . he produces depic@@ tions in accordance with the spr@@ ing@@ table . thereby , the Kam@@ ada K@@ aw@@ ai algorith@@ m is used , which is equivalent with statisti@@ c multi @-@ dimensional scale . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorith@@ m created for un@@ controlled graphs a spr@@ ing@@ table model layout . it uses the fru@@ g@@ man Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi@@ mo@@ ons for the treatment of great and g@@ ec@@ lu@@ gs graphs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorith@@ m provides the knots of circular shaped according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a lay@@ out@@ command as parameter , and the calculated layout of graphs after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give special options , or even the graphs with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graphs ( directed or un@@ just ) and uses the default algorithms for the respective type ( dot ; for targeted , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ coated graph ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed where this is necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
shows the What is the mouse @-@ mouse button . click with this mouse @-@ c@@ ursor to a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get more help on this item ( if present ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images provide tools available to create new images and to submit them .
&quot; this module can be used to appeal to new images from external sources and decre@@ es . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
&quot; pictures sc@@ ans : using the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports through the SAN@@ E project , or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . so that this works you have to install K@@ oo@@ ka and SAN@@ E . &quot;
&quot; if you open the pictures sc@@ ans , a dialog will be displayed between all available sources on your computer . choose the source of which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will replace the pre @-@ given standard values dual cr@@ ates to select your picture before you check with the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; note that the window is completely displayed , since some settings may not be displayed otherwise . &quot;
&quot; once you have pushed down the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window will specify the options of the target image . here you can also select the com@@ pression and type of image file . you also need to select the com@@ pression and type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image saved . &quot;
screens@@ hot photos can generate after you selected in the menu imports &gt; Wall@@ photo ... selected . a window appears in which you can set up the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete work@@ space to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all its own program window is selected , the open program will disappear so that you can read other screens and windows . otherwise , you will be read after a short delay to read the current workplace . if you have read the complete desktop panel , the window is read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen photo will wait , before it starts . if you need to switch on other work@@ space , you should need to pick up this delay high enough to navigate the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screens@@ hot , the dialog options of the target image appears with the options described above . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Calendar is currently not a documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. &quot;

Flick@@ r is an online phot@@ ovoltai@@ c on the Internet . with Flick@@ r it is possible to show his pictures to the people that are important . you can show your favourite photos of the world who show photos of your camera &apos;s online and show your photos safe and your family all over the world .
Flick@@ r module can be used to use images from your computer to a Flick@@ r server in the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time you will use the process of recovery of a Tok@@ ens . it is thus a browser used for your authentic@@ ation . it is thus launched by your credit card . a browser will run , so that you can register with Flick@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to Flick@@ r website . you will be presenting the following page after a successful login . &quot;
simply close the browser window and return to the program back . after you pressed on Yes you get the dialog to upload photos to Flick@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
&quot; if the module ex@@ porting to Flick@@ r for the two times , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which provides the current access to the module , the module does not support any other permission . you will be asked if you want to continue with these eligi@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; the button photos should add once , after you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload . if you press to the O@@ k button , upload the photos to Flick@@ r server . &quot;
&quot; the keywords field can be filled with one by coma @-@ separated list of words . these are added to the image as tags during the flood . &quot;
&quot; with the options open , friends and Fam@@ illi@@ e you can set the access to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the option Modi@@ fy the size of the photos in front of the up@@ loading , the photos are changed before the up@@ loading in size . the size is taken out of the size indicated by the maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of images . the size is so changed that the aspect ratio is constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery @-@ Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server

the K@@ IP@@ I module to geographic loc@@ alization allows GPS co @-@ ordin@@ ates to add and edit . geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF sampling of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization poses tools available to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordination system that is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itu@@ dinal and l@@ ati@@ tudes are used . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS trace as XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ For@@ mat@@ . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert data to you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ relation . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the pictures that you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to load a possible cor@@ relation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains the same time at the same time as the images of your camera . &quot;
if the file is loaded a automatic cor@@ relation is carried out by the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera should be calculated with the GMT . this can be performed with the time zone . place your camera zone here .
&quot; the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and compani@@ es@@ eit , the devi@@ ation below are the data gathered together . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you do not have a trace details of one place for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. can be used if you don &apos;t have any proper data . if you know that in reality a location in a big difference between camera and GPS is , you can put these borders here and then push the button of cor@@ relation to the inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you use a number of photos on the same place . because the dialog will use the coordinates of one call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the present picture . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found with the shown map to be found and set . select the relevant region and enlarge you will have to be selected . the amount has to always be selected manually . the card can be swit@@ ched between map mode , satellite screen and a mixed mode . &quot;
complete outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the exi@@ bition is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to Version 4.01 . you can select the albums as HTML pages , and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is UT@@ F @-@ 8 , to provide the best internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the module has four riders where the settings can be adjusted . the tab is allowed to select all the albums . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically displayed . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly choose a large number of albums . in the area below the Al@@ ben@@ ch@@ schau and the text is displayed in the head of the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely explained by itself . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in the picture . otherwise the image is displayed directly with your default screen , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , indicated &quot;
&quot; the rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you write your writing . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ gu@@ Export , which contains everything there will be created . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures are also stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other colour@@ ing depth , you can change the default colored depth . the influences of course also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the tab shows you some of the settings from the album rider for the umb@@ nails , these are small images displayed in the gallery displayed . &quot;
a progress window shows the user to how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages the window will not automatically be closed . you can therefore read the programmer , to determine whether error occurred during the generation . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery . press Connect around the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I sculp@@ tor is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to look at pictures .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I sculp@@ tor allows you to see a selection of pictures and perform on them base operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or rel@@ oc@@ ating . the observer can be used with short and clicks . it was developed for fast pictures and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after starting , a picture is shown in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free module is a tool to change images without com@@ promising your quality .
&quot; this module allows to store the actions listed below , images in the JP@@ EG format , without the usual losses for quality or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the ver@@ less storage is it that the file size is rising , since no com@@ pression of color information is taking place . this can be found e.g. at the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Digital@@ camera is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Digital@@ camera has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ Module Metad@@ ata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import of the met@@ ad@@ ata function , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the file @-@ optional dialog with which you want to copy the file screen , so the image to which you want to copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data will be copied after you click on the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please check out exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a range of images to a MPEG video in the form of a sli@@ deshow .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG @-@ video , using a defined length to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual images you can add a base transfer . you can also add a audio file at MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV the Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
all images are automatically displayed on the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition you can use a background color for the sli@@ deshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can upgrade the K@@ 3@@ b program .
&quot; first , you first need to be packed in the MPEG sli@@ deshow . after that , you can start using extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to create the module . &quot;
the images selected by you are then enum@@ er@@ ated under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sor@@ ting of images or the content of the list .
&quot; once you are satisfied with your list , you should edit the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is set and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; next step , you should indicate the time in seconds that will indicate a picture . the speed of the image is fixed below . a low value is created very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change . &quot;
the background color can be adjusted as next . in doubt you should leave them black . the name and path of the generated file you can set under name of the MPEG @-@ output files . keep it possible to keep the end@@ anger mp@@ g .
&quot; if you specify a audio file under name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the film . after you have adapted all settings to your needs . depending on the speed of your machine , you can go to the creation of the film . depending on the speed of your machine you can enjoy a coffee and enjoy the sli@@ deshow , if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages on the right down to the button . &quot;
the printer assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet paper together in standard photo@@ size . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print with the Gimp module to direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your data stored in one of three formats JP@@ EG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original symbol of Him is : expect you from d@@ cra@@ w not that it generates the same results , as the software from your camera maker . sometimes you get a bit better results ! &quot;
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted and launch the module . the Ra@@ w image kon@@ verter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now use the values new to optimize the con@@ versions process . the first option decides whether the camera Settings is to be used immediately . if the result is not optimal . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour r@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera is working in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the con@@ currently result . JP@@ EG uses a lu@@ cr@@ ack algorith@@ m and produces for the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the tag@@ ged image format , T@@ IF@@ F , maintains all the information of your image and uses the ver@@ less @-@ free L@@ Z@@ W com@@ pression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to process your pictures frequently or use it later , you should not be able to use the JP@@ EG format since there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ated . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JP@@ EG as storage format , the met@@ ad@@ ata will be contained in the RA@@ W file in the JP@@ EG file in the P@@ 50@@ W file . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start with the execute button . if you want to break this process so you can break off . &quot;
&quot; the st@@ acker processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . use this mode , so if you are sure , e.g. by testing in a single picture , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; however , the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , here you have created the possibility of existing file automatically . however , a preview is not available . a preview is not available on how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ com@@ press all pictures in an album . it uses the program convert from Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can use the pre@@ fix , number of number and tim@@ est@@ amp of the tim@@ est@@ amp . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can enlarge the image , or enlarge . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , selected depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 2 d@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format . &quot;
not proportional : not dis@@ proportion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; printing preparation : preparing the image for photo printing . the user can set the pressure resolution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ api@@ ers . the target image , including background size , boundary size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the pictures before . more images can be drawn to the list of the pictures . &quot;
&quot; after which you started the module , the images -@@ window will be displayed with the pictures selected by you . you can add additional pictures with a file sel@@ ector dialog . for the recently requested picture , a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and add it to you to add it to the list of the pictures .
with the kno@@ b images the selected images will be removed from the list of pictures .
after you have selected all pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected are attached to you as an app@@ endi@@ x .
do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most email accounts are limitations to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and every@@ time again until you change them .
&quot; choose your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the text@@ field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; following the selection of comments in a dup@@ lication file , the comments to the images added to a text file and the mail attached . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo@@ files , but it is best adapted among the distor@@ ted formats , such as T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore use P@@ NG , if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality will not be changed . otherwise we recommend to you the JP@@ EG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JP@@ EG under images file format and the original files in the JP@@ EG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data are added to the pictures . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically be closed so you can see the status quo in search of errors , see . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the kno@@ b box you can ski@@ p this window ? s . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the module , Di@@ asch@@ au appears a window with questions like you have shown your sli@@ deshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL stations in the presentation use very elegant images via OpenGL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , as otherwise the sli@@ deshow will be very slow . &quot;
the option names show that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the pictures are shown in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final sli@@ p@@ loop . you can then manually connect to Es@@ c .
the option pictures by chance choose that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of images in the album .
&quot; under delay between the pictures can be set off between the individual pictures . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen Tran@@ sition . you should therefore show this before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . acci@@ dentally choose any transition between the pictures and another effect .
during the sli@@ deshow you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn off .
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can hold the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the sli@@ deshow . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background is a tool to put an image as a background for working surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your KDE work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image , so in each group , so in persons , places and in group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories , for which you have information entered as you look at your pictures and videos with comments . additionally , there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current umb@@ nails . in the following , each one is described for itself . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you choose another person , only the images are shown on which both people are to be seen . by this selection method , you can limit the number of shown pictures of a few thousand pictures on some single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view the pictures to see the pictures of your action . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can store the same symbol in front of her name . however , for each person , it is also suitable for places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button that you want to use the right outside on the tool@@ bar . you can select the advantage that you can display for example , for example , for example , you have a list of key@@ word ( if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to specify which picture is displayed for every single person . to see this , you need to select the image panel as shown in the picture . here you can select the image for the appropriate person . in the course window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and therefore choose which part of the image is displayed and cut . &quot;
&quot; when you call in the main window entry , you will see a dialog , which is very similar to the dialog for fixing the image properties . this dialog can still be seen on the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a string into the field of lab@@ eling or description , the description shall be sear@@ ched and descriptions of the images after this text is to be chosen ; the date can either be part of the total data , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the bottom part of the window , you can browse all pictures after specific names as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , are not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but rather like to try out the functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and have a look at the quick entry the screens@@ hot photos and the introductory videos .
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help menu k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo will boot . then some sample pictures are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a connected HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of these bar is seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each body shows then another unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by clicking the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used on the following ways : you can preview the requested entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date in the preview file displayed ) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by selecting the mouse button pressed and the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , thus the tim@@ eline , draw up only pictures of this time period . you can break the selection by clicking on a beams of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two options available to create HTML @-@ web sites with your images ; the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module is available ( see ) . the following part of the user album is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the menu file HTML .
&quot; before HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are split into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each section is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the over@@ looked and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album , HTML sample pages , you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album album ; -@@ export file should be created on the overview page . more information about the export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . therefore , you can avoid that information is displayed by a party . for example , that all pictures are exported from a party . for example , that all pictures are exported from a party . you can not use this attitude to hide certain images from certain viewing . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can specify how the HTML pages are to look like . most settings are clearly , which is why not specifically received . &quot;
&quot; bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures . therefore , those who have to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images can download for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you have set up . so it can easily get your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , as well . if he wants to get a picture larger then it changes to higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setup area , you place the different folder and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; the best way to select all your HTML files , and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you must select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder is stored and select for all future images the location . here you can choose either a folder or a of KDE suppor@@ tive protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if this really is visible for the viewer . if you have been created for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , the URL you should be here . otherwise the web browser will launch in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the most of you created HTML files do not have to copy it manually . thus , the import function , see , correctly you will need to specify the final goal of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base ord@@ ner in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the options described in this field have all three on basic folders or URLs . in this one sub@@ folder , whose name you define in output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re looking for a family party , a meeting at the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you might want to use a HTML page to view the pictures , reception , etc . then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not yet even . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ in file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are stored with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ whether the pictures themselves are stored using the file or whether the images can be stored in the file and can pass on all pictures to the file . the obvious disadvantage is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ in file is looking for images in two different ways . first , the images are not found in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . if the appropriate images are not found , the images of the URL are specified . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML @-@ Export . &quot;
in the following will be described in the dialog for export pictures that you can export over the menu .
&quot; the main option of this dialogue is whether you should act in internal or external .@@ k@@ im files , following three choices are available : &quot;
&quot; to copy Manu@@ ell to the .@@ k@@ in file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ in file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Autom@@ atic into the proximity of the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the images automatically copy for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ in files are normal Zip files . since most pictures already have been com@@ pressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not the files com@@ pressed . if you would like to do this anyway , simply tick the option export file . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page reads Maxim@@ ale image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , as the .@@ k@@ im file else would be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that every picture is at a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Format ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the exported database is described as described in . &quot;
&quot; the assistant for Im@@ por@@ ters consists of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then , in which folder you want to import images . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are to import the category people of the file , while this category is called for your database persons , while this category is asked with your database persons . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialogue window in which categories of which are to be imported , and which categories will comply with them in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can import the categories of the following file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse and look for pictures : if you look at pictures , you want to view images of your Italy holiday and to discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find the different steps from the ( 1 ) commemor@@ ating the information about your images , via ( 2 ) the flow and reputation , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adapt@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program for the pamper@@ ing of your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual , more pictures talked about pictures , but frequently it also includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all his information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their pictures . these are a simple XML file , which you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they would like . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , notice the folder in which your images are stored and used in future start@@ ts again . if you have a different folder with pictures , you can start another folder with pictures , you can start another folder ; with the option -@@ c album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / index@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; to set up the menu settings k@@ photo@@ album , set up ... enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user book , you will explain the various settings options . &quot;
&quot; links see six different symbols , with which you can view settings for viewing and the options for the viewer . for each setting , you can access the F1 button and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; in case you describe how to set up different properties like you for any picture of different properties , e.g. individuals , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for any existing group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section , sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead , instead all groups of a Medi@@ gli@@ eds as stated in . &quot;
&quot; in fact , you can see the settings options available to you . with the above selection list , you can choose the category you want to configure . in the left window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , his module with other graphic applications , such as the K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page , which you can view over the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; as the modules can be used together with each other , it can be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is only very little tested with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album , demo database , you can either visit the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . tell me , I would not have war@@ ned ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , allowing it to be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , this kind of order does not support , simul@@ ates it for some modules the order of albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all pictures that shows you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also has to pass a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category is an album available for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category that you have defined in the creation dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you have for example the category individuals will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , so if you have chosen people to view and to pass this module . &quot;
&quot; because some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start on the setup dialog and select in the area modules which modules should be loaded . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you can see an example of a start screen , once you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used from any other KDE application , see the window top of a menu and a tool@@ bar . currently , it does not have a lot of information , as you do not see any information about your pictures . in the section we will return to this window , then click on the entry pictures , which shows you an overview with all existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , is the possibility to see any image with notes on the picture where the picture was recorded , etc. you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of pictures certain comments at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for finding and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes , if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , as you always use it again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea lies the moving of images within the list : if you have a family party and have shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can find that the names of the names are moved upwards , the people can find faster and assign . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get a alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have any comments on each image individually , you might want to edit all selected images and provide these pictures with comments . click in this case simply on the front and back buttons , which are under the preview of the image right above . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all these images and use the menu item for multiple entries at once with a comment . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . furthermore , San Francisco and Los Angeles in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you see a browser window of the USA as a survi@@ ving group . to show you that it is a group of group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the principal p@@ ale , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also create an entry to a category and insert it to create this to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . see it . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the attraction by putting the bar , which form the upper edge of the frame , anchor and postp@@ one . you can make it out of a frame also a separate window by moving it outside the window . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to suit your needs , click on the button options ... , which allows you to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can make a frame also completely eliminated . if you want to see this window later , use the button options ... and here the window will see a / out . this process will see you in the picture . &quot;
&quot; selecting the entry pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with a review of the currently selected images , or all pictures in case you have no filter here . you can configure the size of the umb@@ nails , configure the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it just times . &quot;
&quot; if you leave an image on the background of your desktop , this picture is set as a background for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this in the picture is displayed . if you have not yet opened a window with a sculp@@ tor , a new indicator will be created . &quot;
you can delete images in the picture show too . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the removal button or select in the menu Edit selection . now you can see the window you can see in the picture .
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use this problem without you stored on your hard drive . of course , you have to record the pictures anywhere else , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can view the pictures from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; pictures where the right upper edge is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the umb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can view the preview of these images . however , you can also view these pictures with the image . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and again copy . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , it is not yet to ask you to avoid the one of the relevant CD . if you do so , if you would like to avoid connected with your images , please buy a larger disk to save all pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to stay a little more privacy , you may want to stay in the menu . alternatively , you can also view all the pictures that may see your small sister , cont@@ ests and the menu item All except current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have set out what images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop now your little sister , just select the menu of your little sister , adding all the images you have locked up . if you want to see the pictures again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that must be entered . to submit this password , just choose password in the menu . &quot;
&quot; please note that this picture protection is not very safe . for example , all pictures on the hard drive and the other can be able to read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only suitable for those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to bl@@ asting the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours for hours so that you want to see them at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has a picture _ and video view . you can preview the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; of course you can see the viewer . of course , it shows the image , but additional all the information you have to enter the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ Box on the upper part of the image you want to see , so you can simply drag them with the mouse and click here . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . you can see the menu menu menu . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see , suitable entries to this view . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have chosen individuals from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can jump between them and go back by using the keys image high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a sli@@ deshow . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it can press a new image by pressing the Str@@ g Taste and Plus or minus . the Di@@ asch@@ au will run through the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
&quot; a very useful capability of the beh@@ older of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , is to change in full mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . just use the input button to switch in full screen mode and back . &quot;
if you use the viewer you can use the viewer in the picture and finish zo@@ oming . with the mouse you can easily drag a rect@@ angle . with the minus button you can return again r@@ aus@@ zo@@ oming The plus button zo@@ oming is marked in the middle of the picture . shows how a z@@ oom rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
&quot; with the point button you can reset your z@@ oom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed to be zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ alisation of the zo@@ oms , so any pixel is equivalent to the screen a pixel of the picture . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work with videos that are in and can be zo@@ oming with the plus and the key issues .
&quot; with the bases from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you look at pictures it can happen that you will have a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can view the om@@ iting and configur@@ ations dialog of the picture to give these names . however , you &apos;ll possibly prefer to highlight the picture and look more pictures . &quot;
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and highlight them as good or bad while you are one after the other .
&quot; for the two examples above you give the viewer the possibility to watch pictures with features , while reading them . features are the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you press the appropriate letters . in see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your images , they are available to you in your browser . so you can see all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the front view . if you view the categories in dre pre@@ view , then you can press features to the pictures by clicking the picture once the picture was chosen . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
&quot; the mind is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can use your mind later . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can see a picture on the ground @-@ old . to switch the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , click on the picture paint out of the context menu . to finish the cap press , simply put the cross in the tool@@ bar top on the window . &quot;
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must not know the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not completely master , but the documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the property tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties tab and displayed the object in the wire @-@ model items yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the properties tree , select the position in which you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are several possible positions , the following set @-@ up menu ends , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with delet@@ ing either from the menu bar under editing or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click on applying these changes . if you have invali@@ d values , a message with a fault description will be displayed . then you can edit the input data and apply the changes with ab@@ rupt . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray , user documentation in the interior dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the shown object with the help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press review in the peculi@@ ar view and a small example of the scene is selected with the selected texture . as default , the whole texture will be selected . if you just want a part of texture outside ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , cross locally . &quot;
the screens@@ hot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can draw these check@@ points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; if a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points disappear and it becomes a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifting . you can change the shift through the mouse within the whole window . &quot;
&quot; each object has an output level of visible stage . you can indicate this value relative to Visi@@ on@@ eness of the higher level of object , or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or its visible stage , smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar selected visible stage of the scene . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as an attitude . the lens tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the default window , or if you need any other arrangement , you can adjust them to any number of windows . you can also switch several window constructions and easily switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window on or below a view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter on the right or left side of a view . the new view is anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views of each other , drag the starter turn right onto another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the cart@@ on top of the views on top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window lin@@ eup are sh@@ ad@@ ful views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the starter on the desktop or click the small to the left above arrow in the editor . &quot;
&quot; to view a view , click on the small cross in the editor . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu View you will find entries for any type of views . new views are narrow , you can anchor them at any time . &quot;
the current window view can save you with view window to store ... save . it will be a dialog in which you can save the window to an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to the ren@@ dering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , was &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 does not support . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ dering The icon ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item view scene . &quot;
&quot; a ren@@ dering mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to ren@@ dering a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of Ren@@ der modes , from a quick preview to full @-@ pictures in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the symbol The Ren@@ der settings in the tool@@ bar , or in the menu View Ren@@ der Mo@@ di ... , the following dialog will open : &quot;
&quot; each Ren@@ der mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that can recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the cardboard card size , you can insert the width and height of the left picture . if you only want to ren@@ dering a small area of the picture , select the cross section and enter the image section to the ren@@ dering in the input fields . &quot;
in the combination field quality you can choose the characteristics that uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; to ren@@ dering it . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refl@@ ections . a detailed description of the Ren@@ der properties can be found in the user manual and Pov@@ ray .
&quot; if a picture is displayed with only a beam each pixel , there are often different mistakes . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or ste@@ pl@@ et effect in cur@@ ves and lines , also sometimes details are not displayed when it is shown in the representation smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors , in general see images with this feature better . &quot;
&quot; when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam each pixel . this technique is called great sampling . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling the adjacent pixel is adap@@ tive ; recur@@ sively because every Pixel is moving forward and adap@@ tive because the record system depends on the calculated shades .
&quot; if you choose the first method , following POV @-@ Ray set a ray each pixel . if the difference between the colour values are loaded with super sampling , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated , with a low value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams of pixels . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the colour values exce@@ eds the pre @-@ level threshold , the pixels will be followed in 4 sub@@ pixel , which can be checked individually and can be checked on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of records can be checked by lowering . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of reducing the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ atter@@ ing . if you turn J@@ atter@@ ing , changing &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the bl@@ asting around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use of light reflection , it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this box card , you can adjust if the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding beams have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for the display of the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ consoles . if &amp; Pov@@ ray is finished , you can find the reason for this here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray , select the menu of import ... and choose a file in dialogue window . &quot;
currently &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; Not yet supports the complete command of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if you encounter any error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window shows a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can export objects from the properties in the editor to import the source text in the Editor &apos;s text file in the Editor . to import objects into the scene , just highlight the source text in the editor , and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; also fit .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene is ren@@ amed . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in the peculi@@ ar view , opens up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation to the indicated object . place the path to your document , and the version . supported the versions 3,@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example high altitude data ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; library . if you get files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to those files here . if a file occurs in different ways of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire @-@ models . the second color is used for the display of the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the refl@@ ective in the camera view and in the window type characteristic .
&quot; you can set the object to adjust the points to the R@@ aster in the context menu of the Dra@@ ht@@ Model views . you can set the R@@ aster separate for shifting , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values give a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the shown objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball you can set the details for two directions separately . &quot;
&quot; if you hit the high level model for advanced proj@@ ections , all the wireless model &apos;s views will be divided into account when the camera is an extended projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the bottom right proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; if you show wall , a wall behind the objects displayed . the wall is displayed in a chess boards from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you display soil , a soil is displayed below the objects . the floor is displayed in a chess boards from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you activate the cant@@ onal , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more detailed information on the parameters can be found in the Ren@@ der @-@ modes . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can modify existing lin@@ ders or create new window orders . in the section V@@ asi@@ an lists , you can create and save window orders . &quot;
the combination field standard window window : displays all the existing window systems . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window to start the start of the program .
the list available lin@@ ders displays all existing window systems . a new arrangement can create you with the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button removal .
every window of window will be identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the chosen window order . new views can add you to the button and delete selected views with the button removal .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , you will create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with unknown card , you will get a cart@@ on card along with the previous view and sound@@ ing the view not in the main window , but produces a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just installed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among its beginnings very popular : a bul@@ let on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should consider the following war@@ nings carefully before you complain that you as a result will only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules are applied to the ren@@ ders , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not fit light sources , your whole scene is in the dark , and you just get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have all faul@@ t@@ less installed , you can see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window . &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can expect a proper idea what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use this menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the lens tree . select the scene and then select the menu editing editing . so you have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the Dra@@ ht@@ Model View shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you generate . in particular , you notice the scene from the view of the camera . this is the view of the scene from the scene . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the lens tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click here , see the content of the view of the lens Properties , in which the various parameters of the camera is found . in the user &apos;s documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera in view points will change . simply click with the left mouse button on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; if you apply the button or the entrance paste , the Dra@@ ht@@ Model views and the lens tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result you see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could insert a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body quart@@ z ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a ren@@ unci@@ ation method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simple option . you can use an infinite level as a floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the plane in the property tree , change the name and then press the button or the entrance paste . in the lens tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the Dra@@ ht@@ Model View now shows the level , even at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the layer extends up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the lens tree , you will notice that you click on the symbol + before the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case
&quot; in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horiz@@ ont@@ aneous line , only to get some of these parameters . select shift and place the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; only select the ground in order to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialog opens , in which you can choose how the object can be inserted . please choose the name in the property tree ( name = soil pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview see how the pig@@ ment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course the preview of the pig@@ ments only shows a Matt@@ es black material , because you can still enter settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , you can always remember the colors for pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the easiest . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to view a color on qu@@ ader and ball , just click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the ground is now correct . if you ren@@ dering your image now with a click on the icon , you should receive the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color . you are expected to enter two new attributes . in the case list , you have to do two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this also more frequently , but the Chess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; select in the lens tree every time , and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
this step you should already make you easy to run as you should have understood the fundamental functioning of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have understood . the ball can be just as easy as the ground :
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can instantly change the settings . put the value for radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input paste or the button . otherwise the bul@@ let go above the bottom , since you have moved the bottom to a unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ dering now results a strange result : as before seeing , the ball surface as a Matt@@ es black material . put you in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material you now . as on the ground , enter the sphere of a pig@@ ment as colour : &quot;
&quot; select First sub@@ object and change the name for example in the sphere of pig@@ ment . click on the sphere of pig@@ ment , then select the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach interest@@ ingly , if you take the time to set some finish @-@ properties : &quot;
change the values like in the following screens@@ hot and click on apply or press the entrance paste .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and refl@@ ections already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or ch@@ rom@@ ed surfaces , even if Met@@ allic : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you have &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can easily create , but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tr@@ ay@@ cing is a ren@@ dering method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts , the ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical stress from the perspective of the beh@@ older ( i.e. from the camera , which is reflected the scenes ) through the objects in the scene and like the atmospheric effects of light sources in the scene and like the atmospheric effects , such as fog . thus the scene is pixels for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be en@@ rolled , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open a new model or create a new model , the file is inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaced the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and storage space . &quot;
imagine the scene in the last stored version . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
this menu item you can only select if you do not yet have stored changes in the scene .
&quot; to repeat the last one @-@ out command . this menu entry , you can only select if you have used editing life . &quot;
saves the current window system and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new order or write an existing order .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new files with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; orders change or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove this option tool for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; -@@ commands and remove .
&quot; a B@@ ump @-@ map is a way to assign surface finishes , without any b@@ ump on the surface separately and without change the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself . &quot;
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both B@@ ump @-@ Map and for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ rical shapes which you can use as a building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced by do@@ zens or even hundreds of these basic body . these models will then continue to give them a realistic appearance .
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixels base , by applying an image file as a color card . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable sculp@@ tor and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
pictures can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking on &amp; L@@ MB@@ I ; or the button return .
you can adjust if any picture should be displayed in a separate window or if all pictures should always use the same window .
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply tap the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field was found in the lower right corner . if a password file is highlighted , the file is highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in dialog - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cardboard cards . in three of them , general and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; setup . in the two other , short command for the display and short command for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this is selected , then the pictures are opened in full mode . if the picture is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad screen filled with the background color , which you can adjust further down . default settings is not a full mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is enabled , invites &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still see the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for sli@@ deshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; with the name of the last open@@ er folder . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the coloured beams to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full mode . if in the window mode the window is bigger than the image , it is also filled with the selected colour here . &quot;
you can set up &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; so set up that only some of the file types are shown that the program can also be present .
&quot; with this option , the display will be enlarged for large images to the full screen . this option is swit@@ ched as a default . &quot;
sets whether the sli@@ deshow will start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the time span between the image change at a sli@@ deshow . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default setting is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the sli@@ deshow will be repeated until it is broken down by the user . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default setting is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of &amp; cu@@ ick@@ show ; in the cardboard maps short command for the display and short command for the browser .
with this option you turn between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .

&quot; show@@ photo ; makes it as easy as possible errors or possible improvements . wherever you use the menu , the menu contains a link to reports of problems and wishes . all necessary information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to finish your message . &quot;
&quot; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that &apos;s , that users and developers can help each other . if you have a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; then we would like to answer any questions about other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; but hopefully , we would like to answer any questions about other users . in this mailing list , however , you should soon be aware of this language . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . guidance to join the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; &quot;
&quot; show@@ photo ; try to give you as much control over your work processes as possible . there are many options , the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; change to these settings , you must switch in the menu settings show@@ photo ; you can switch between them by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure to indi@@ g@@ ators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ ne@@ al or over@@ se@@ aling indicator should be selected , if the under@@ carriage should be displayed , in contrast , a bright color and over@@ exposure should display a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and promotions to the selected images . the same page bar can also be found in the image processing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for sc@@ ans of images that does not make more than a sc@@ ans and fixing .
&quot; &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and storage of images , which can no longer make a dialog to store and save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the pictures before storage . &quot;
you can check the status of support of your sc@@ aling on the SAN@@ E proj@@ ections by clicking the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; can be set in terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner was specified , then a dialog to choose the scanning . &quot;
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . Canc@@ el will finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; finish .
the other settings contain more detailed options of driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not address these options especially .
&quot; to record a picture , the user can start a pre @-@ off and then start scanning for the final scan . the pres@@ sch@@ can start by the preview button . &quot;
to better select the picture the user can get into the image and out of the current selection out zo@@ oming . he can also set the z@@ oom so that the complete preview is fit into the window .
when the picture was chosen then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
&quot; if the stor@@ ing a preview show in the settings is selected , then the image is displayed in a showcase , shown below . if saving pushed , then the image will be saved and rip ? s leads to a break@@ out and you get back into the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the kno@@ b settings , the ep@@ onymous dialogue will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before stor@@ ing . in this case the option before saving a preview is selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures stores it . dialog to save any picture opens the dialog in front of any sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must save without having to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting is defined where the pictures are stored on the option . if the pictures are stored after each scan , this folder will be used as a standard for dialogue to saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture fix for the automatically storage images and is also the proposed name for image in dialogue to save . the automatically @-@ stored image gets an num@@ eric Su@@ ff@@ ix of each time , when a picture is saved . the string # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adapt to the saving user quality . this value also changes the com@@ pression level when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the kno@@ b help starts the KDE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the KDE About -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing may be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to finish .

&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used as all other programs short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of this cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can set you up , clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , click with the right mouse button in the player window and select short command ... &quot;
you may need to set existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; -@@ short command . thus make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control centre .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which usually can be found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists and scripts . an example set up for the D@@ CO@@ P function . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the command lines of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok still has some own commands options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback when the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependence . please check in your script , whether all necessary modules are present and use the dialog , so that the user ID is not running . &quot;
desire &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ un@@ dum ( KDE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder scrip@@ ts / , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts , or they can easily find the required functions . you will quickly notice that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , you can control your scripts with Amar@@ o@@ P and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p , which should be included in every KDE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages enable the output of external programs and commands . this is usually used the function Ex@@ ec ( ) . this way can d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be called . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends messages to all running scripts . for this reason scripts , script should be monitored continuously and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the interior dialog . to save the saving and store of the furnishings , each script needs to take care of each script . if a script is run , Amar@@ ok will be stored on the folder , where all data should be saved . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is tr@@ acked . the script could now be &amp; eg ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the pier ) .
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alizes a change of volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu item@@ id Tit@@ le to use the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user @-@ defined menu item can be used . to remove an entry again you can remove d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item@@ tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it stops , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. Au@@ fr@@ aming . this signal should be used for example the saving of data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ oks script management can also install script packages , which can be downloaded with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which can also be com@@ pressed to b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ o@@ script script . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Exten@@ sion amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right right . &quot;
&quot; the main@@ page must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to inv@@ ading modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameters -@@ p to obtain the file right : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can rech@@ arge it at www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and the link to the Wi@@ ki script . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you only look for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . perhaps you are looking for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection @-@ browser and the quick@@ search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have already some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult to choose the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically choose the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many general USB devices . besides , many more useful features make Amar@@ ok for the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music again ! &quot;
&quot; usually , one has to enter the basics of Amar@@ ok &apos;s sources to compile and install Amar@@ o@@ at : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should be compiled with the compile no difficulties . if you encounter any problems , please report this please to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok , has the most applications able to enable or dis@@ able some options that you can activate or dis@@ able the comp@@ iling point with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ ili@@ er@@ options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system requirements . &quot;
&quot; de@@ activated de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help when developing &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without any trouble on the interior dialog . the interior dialog has several cardboard cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
&quot; player window display the player window in addition to the playlist , or off . if the option is swit@@ ched off , only the playlist window is sho@@ wn@@ 1 . &quot;
mood bar@@ ometer use : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar has been compiled . the option swit@@ ched the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer .
&quot; elabor@@ ation of design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , it is modified by the colour scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; voting files in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise , the .@@ 29 files are stored on the storage location of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise , the .@@ 29 files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser is run by &amp; Amar@@ ok , when a browser is needed . &quot;
&quot; other browsers are using : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot;
playlist save the playlist automatically stores the current playlist automatically at the end of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist .
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this attitude , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , use from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; up @-@ to @-@ date pieces in the piece change can be visible , that the play@@ lists are up @-@ up , to keep the current piece always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when compared to the context @-@ browser context , the context @-@ browser will automatically change the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is tr@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; in the section of appearance , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the fonts section you can use the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . you can select fonts for the following section : play@@ lists window , player windows and context @-@ browser . press release ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of user @-@ defined color scheme , you yourself the Qu@@ al of your choice and can set up a separate color scheme . use the included color selection for shape and wall@@ papers . &quot;
&quot; you will continue playing at the start that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start the play@@ back automatically with the piece , with which it was stopped with the last load . &quot;
the sub@@ window On @-@ screen display allows you to switch off the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is displayed , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click to select ... to select from the dialog the required font for the O@@ SD . the cross @-@ field shade will be represented by the text in the O@@ SD sh@@ aded .
&quot; own colors will use the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and backgrounds . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog to the color selection . if appropriate colors will not be activated , the pre @-@ placed &amp; k@@ de ; colors will be used . &quot;
&quot; the input field display text presents the text shown in the O@@ SD text . by entering dimensions , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available sets and what they mean . &quot;
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to set up on which screen to appear a multi @-@ bit monitor around the O@@ SD card .
the cardboard card audio edition lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers will enable further adjustment options in this box card .
the cardboard card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , browse the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , just mark the cross @-@ edge fields next to its name . this section also contains the cross @-@ edge fields to set up , as with the selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folder speak : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders to music as well .
changes : allows &amp; amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) in order to make the necessary changes to your collection .
play@@ lists import : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection can be added later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part of the exec@@ uting database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected is still further set up in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ ql setup .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql @-@ establishment panel is used for inser@@ tion of the database for &amp; Amar@@ o@@ . under calcul@@ ator , the computer is entered on which the My@@ S@@ ql databases is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is made . &quot;
use user name : and password : to input data that needs to be used for connection to the database .
&quot; the cardboard card last@@ .@@ f@@ m is intended to provide support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok , can transmit the names of played mos@@ quit@@ oes to a low .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece . &quot;
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
&quot; copies pieces and so update the profile : this setting allows for it &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; , the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot;
&quot; similar interpre@@ ters go : after activation of this attitude , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters will be retri@@ eved . you can view the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile , to use this function . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the features and gallery with screens@@ hot photos .
Amar@@ o@@ ok only requires the package of K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; we need some of them to compile e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have made a small guide how to comp@@ iling K@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager support the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome is thus functioning , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these are an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can check the file by using in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report the cap@@ ut@@ te file that caused the crash . then you can delete the file and make the collection again .
mostly this is that Tag@@ lib read on reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a little more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries using the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , then this leads to turn@@ out of the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use KDE using art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate it automatically , if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or do not use any value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the Back@@ packs by e @-@ mail ( the email opens automatically with a crash ) , and you will send us a good back@@ end , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many program data can write as UT@@ F @-@ 8 to the met@@ a @-@ info , but not as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / perl the &quot; The file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3 &gt; Set _ v@@ 2@@ day ( $ v@@ 2@@ day , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ E &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random smo@@ ked / re@@ petition / Dynam@@ ic playlist ) see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , this is a known bug in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can click the status De@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . please note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
if you get this bug : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ il@@ symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then check if Amar@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be shown with ld@@ d &apos;@@ y amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may possibly remove any col@@ li@@ zing Q@@ t version or remove / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are resolved at ligh@@ test by means of a experts your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or with the developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net on the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please use there only one mistake if something is located at the removal of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after starting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; appears only a blank playlist . how to get music pieces there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start @-@ window was converted into the Statisti@@ cs window . you can find it under Extr@@ as statistics . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed , with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the review by the user , while the points will be automatically calculated . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the playlist column must be displayed in the playlist column . click anywhere in the new rating column , to set the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select the playlist from the up menu . &quot;
drag a playlist file using the mouse to the playlist and let them fall exactly how you would make it with other files too . so simple is that : - )
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the Add @-@ button , is to store the button playlist . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the package x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install the package x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look even for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it via the menu bar under Extr@@ as E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; no . yes , that really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end @-@ independent approach , therefore the actual question are the Whi@@ ch Typ@@ es / x@@ ine / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support this pretty much more conceivable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even support text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which makes no MP3 de@@ coder . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; playing MP3 to : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ ot driver with the AL@@ SA S@@ ink , the device needs to use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows several applications to use the device at the same time and can be obtained through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA . &quot;
the output of this command should help you find the problem of problems and a solution . for g@@ stre@@ amer you may need to specify another rope ( e.g. os@@ s@@ z ) .
&quot; this is doing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media first need to be de@@ codi@@ le . you can only hear a white smoke . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codi@@ le the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly at AL@@ SA , just as well as x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . activate sound@@ server with highest priority ( warning time ) and increase the size of the sound bu@@ ffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per su@@ id is set : &quot;
&quot; with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s , which can cause re@@ pl@@ ying play . read this bug report . read the enlarge of the sound Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA furniture file .@@ as@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well . &quot;
&quot; either you will not use the Arts driver , but instead you install G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE multimedia complete to get the quicker Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less applications respond to visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , runs &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ stre@@ amer , you must register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help you can also ask at the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
&quot; then try this ( end Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download your m@@ peg down , compile and install it . then install G@@ ST @-@ register all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ o@@ . &quot;

&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . place an alarm in your calendar programme and leave with the alarm to execute this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ player play &quot;
&quot; this command makes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the play start . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you won by the gentle k@@ gs of music that you have stopped in front of bed . &quot;
how can you experience the current title in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running the titles when one is in another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is available you can proceed as follows . diesel command gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pl@@ aying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA is present .

&quot; basically , this fits the previous review with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has any individual rating on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can click the rating for a piece yourself by clicking on a Sp@@ al@@ ten@@ ance in the play@@ lists . here , you can select the evaluation of a piece page as well as all the other attributes also , namely by selecting the right mouse button on the piece and edit : rating or F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the dialog met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the developers don &apos;t want to announce that you should publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : KDE packages have a fixed release plan , which is not to be combined with the short notice plan of Amar@@ o@@ . &quot;

&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of cr@@ ashes and thus also a lot of fault reports . &quot;
presum@@ ably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer have installed . therefore the / configure routine does not compile this output modules . you have to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; new to configure and install .
&quot; now I have been installed &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; new installed , but the output modules are still not available . and now ? &quot;
presum@@ ably use a distribution which installed the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer are installed separately . the same goes for x@@ ine you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you have to re@@ compile and install Amar@@ ok ; once again you have to re@@ compile and install .
I get the mistakes G@@ stre@@ amer Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos;@@ ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ ess that is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without a rel@@ ant . a tip of Merlin @-@ TC : users do not compile L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
&quot; I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;

I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound@@ card ?
under settings Amar@@ o@@ set ... Audio @-@ edition give the device one . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug @-@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug @-@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter the interior dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib will take care of the conversion of the to@@ g@@ astr@@ ate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ card supports m@@ map . &quot;

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio formats from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Dis@@ disc Digital Audio ) . on the internet such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
&quot; og@@ g Pre@@ bis library : og@@ g Pre@@ bis is an entirely open , patented free and professional technology for audio data streams . og@@ g pre @-@ up benefits from open source and is available in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis Dec@@ o@@ der@@ - and en@@ coder modules . &quot;
&quot; MA@@ D : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio decor . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 de@@ coder module . &quot;
&quot; l@@ ame : a more developed MP3 de@@ coder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ en@@ coder module . &quot;
FL@@ AC : a free open source co@@ dec for ver@@ less audio com@@ pression and de@@ com@@ pression . it is used by FL@@ AC @-@ Dec@@ oder module and the external audio @-@ en@@ coder module so that you can read FL@@ AC files .
&quot; Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FL@@ AC , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : further libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is for example possible to de@@ cryp@@ t W@@ MA files to save it on an audio CD . &quot;
SO@@ x : a relief program that can convert between different audio formats - and convert . SO@@ x is used by the SO@@ x Audio En@@ coder module .
trans@@ code : a command line application for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : an active car system to manipul@@ ate , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analysis of video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files on a standard level . this can be useful for example to create rented CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different cav@@ ity can lead the various albums to the un@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces differ according to them . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically restore all videos in the basics of the CD .
&quot; this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has already been stored once , the file is over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project under a new date . KDE &apos;s dialog is displayed , with which you can choose a folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file . &quot;
saves all open projects . this is the same when you save for every single project file saving .
&quot; closes the current project . if a project is changing and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; according to what has to happen . you can then leave between Save and changes . besides , you can also break down and keep the project so opened . &quot;
&quot; closes all the open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is to ask for every not stored project , which should happen to happen , just as if you were called for each project file . &quot;
closes all the open projects and termin@@ ated &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for each not stored project is asked what to happen to happen as if you have called File Connect .
&quot; if you call this entry , you can click on the published dialog files to add to the project . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the upper view into the project opinion , the so @-@ added files in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the characteristics @-@ dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional Kno@@ b Burn , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only open when the project already includes data . &quot;
&quot; opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . any project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above What is that ? -@@ Help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you use files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful when you are not used for a multi @-@ session CD . it is useful for you to see the data already existing files and folders .
&quot; this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature led to remove &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files will be removed in the project . this function removed no files from the medium , they bl@@ ends only the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD @-@ copying dialog . this allows also without project file to create a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can also use only one image from a CD you can then burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of K@@ lon@@ ens instead of normal cop@@ ier . you should also prefer l@@ apping if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD copying dialog . this allows also without project file to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also get only one image of a DVD using the copying dialog . besides , there is also the possibility of a DVD using the copying dialog will not be supported , therefore the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data from source media in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
&quot; opens the dialog to the form@@ atting of a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely er@@ ased . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the sp@@ read@@ i over@@ write and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; bur@@ ns a before CD @-@ screen . the dialog asks for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which then immediately is not supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; bur@@ ns a previously made DVD @-@ screen . the dialog asks for a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source , which can then be burned out by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously mentioned DVD Video can be converted . thereby helps you read this dialog window . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the ingredients , but can also be used all@@ ein@@ st@@ . it contains information about the exclusive video , codi@@ fication settings and even options to change the size and to cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the included medium . this information is displayed in the ingredients and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title @-@ length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of tool@@ boxes of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small cor@@ ste is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; switch the folder view file or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content is activated , its content is displayed in the content . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locks and un@@ locking of the disk or dis@@ car@@ ding of the medium . &quot;
&quot; swit@@ ched the ingredients , or out . the ingredients allows the to choose and drag files into the project view . the content is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; folded the p@@ anc@@ est in the project view one or out . the p@@ anc@@ est is a narro@@ wer area that contains only visible when the project view has open projects . the p@@ anc@@ est has no real function , it only looks pretty , and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the keyboard orders for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . after one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard assignment to them below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; oral assistant . thus , the correct permission to be adjusted to the burning of CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administration rights needs , therefore you must enter the password for the system administration ( root ) . &quot;
opening the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here are all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and to re@@ forming the program .
&quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface equipped with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions to use , you can either use the command len@@ ding program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program k@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to the function@@ alities , therefore , is rather your taste and the type of your task force decisive in which the accompanying program you give . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume that you use the command len@@ ding program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; to use the functions , you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , all &amp; k@@ de ; programme created , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects . &quot;

&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ out@@ les@@ er for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be saved and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible depending on en@@ coder of computer installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading from &amp; CD ; data in W@@ AV files on the hard disk ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ ers who are currently supported by Linux distribution ) . more Ko@@ di@@ erer can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD will be read and stored in W@@ AV files on the computer ( lu@@ st@@ free and com@@ pressed ) ; and then . &quot;
are in a second step these W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) com@@ pressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or other formats as the lu@@ st@@ free FL@@ AC .
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ pre @-@ up ( for MP3 ) or other co@@ di@@ ers are already available , it is therefore very likely not necessary to compile some yourself . however , if FL@@ AC does not need to be used , the installation is also not necessary . &quot;
which codi@@ fication / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction via Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and com@@ pression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to avoid any copying protection . if not the firmware of the copying protection is not possible . avoid the purchase of cop@@ ier @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once must be made ( the interior dialog can be viewed as often as a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling of a &amp; CD is explained so often . this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the slim approach to the user interface , which you often stum@@ bled at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can transform into many formats - depending on which co@@ di@@ erer programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB can get out of the Internet , or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is detected manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example , you will find further information on how this program is used as well as screens@@ hot photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starting the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the establishment of inquiry in the tab CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case must first connect the connection to the Internet . ) &quot;
starts reading and - if an en@@ coder into the tab is configured in the interior catalog - the coding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that the selection with another en@@ coder can be read as the standard . it is to be noted that the en@@ coder in the tab is configured in the registration dialog . &quot;
opens the file manager so that an already pending file is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD .
opens the furnishings to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading of the &amp; CD ; closing ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main @-@ cutting dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different cardboard cards ( such as en@@ coder , to set the ends ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , Ko@@ di@@ erer and com@@ pression rates , and helps you choosing the right code . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a lu@@ c @-@ free audio format is required . besides FL@@ AC there are also others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may possibly be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the small com@@ pression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats , the information generated by data com@@ pressed depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio @-@ quality at lower Bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both Ko@@ di@@ erer will produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will nevertheless be supplied with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions . &quot;
+ high to very high quality quality ( with high bit@@ ches ) but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at deeper bit@@ rates .
og@@ g - if only music is intended to be heard from one machine or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , disk drive ) or special Auto @-@ Stere@@ oph@@ agus . today - in the beginning of 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters for the audio @-@ quality and the resulting com@@ pression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stere@@ otypes with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , com@@ pression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stere@@ otypes with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &quot; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , com@@ pression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stere@@ otypes with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , com@@ pression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a tit@@ els . good enjoyment for music of young people , portable devices and Auto@@ stere@@ os@@ cill@@ ators . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stere@@ otypes . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this attitude . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that is run manually or by the program automatically fet@@ ched from the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be handed over / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the codi@@ le program to generate the folder and the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with co@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there is often a combination of program provisions for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers declare the switch for these programmes . &quot;
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ word ( English : day ) add the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; C@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters which can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in assist@@ ants ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which persons can download the audio CDs , so that all other information can be downloaded by yourself in the computer . it is to note that here only by text is spoken by yourself : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( arri@@ m of the ure@@ ac@@ ers : this is the author meant ) am not attorney . however , no one can prevent the information on the &amp; CD ; for more or less valuable , so either the artist can damage nor the music company . all information can be obtained from a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtual . &quot;
in &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active a cross @-@ section ( S@@ itting a address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ ated ) address as the data in the system . this type of configuration is not used ( This may only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
&quot; in many countries there are copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for the use of free@@ DB , the geographic server will be used . this saves band@@ width in the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to Fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mir@@ rors for the online call of &amp; CD ; information during the read of a &amp; CD ; alternatively you can download the complete database or ( usually monthly ) only the updates to the database .
which read@@ able program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see for sure that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed first when this is not yet done .
&quot; to save the s@@ lic@@ ed W@@ AV files can be chosen in the Ko@@ di@@ erer and thus the desired file format . in the first opening , there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FL@@ AC ( a distor@@ ted com@@ pression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the code . other co@@ ders can be added to this tab . &quot;
&quot; the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed by the concerned Linux distribution , before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined Ko@@ di@@ erer . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; after installing a codi@@ le , further information on his switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a consoles window ( eg ; kon@@ sole ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the setup of the device recording of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and reader of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envel@@ ope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , these tips can give you how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do is ? well , no problem , follow this step for @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those fields that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time to read everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) .
&quot; it must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is not totally free software for example , as it is not completely free software to compile , what you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you have scre@@ ened it ( eg ; by trying to copy something in the con@@ quer@@ or something ) .
the first section covers the basic specification of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably done only once and
&quot; the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for every out@@ going &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; here we determine the suitable Ko@@ di@@ erer to com@@ pression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are lazy to use the program to download the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not be able to read one &amp; CD at any time , once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device @-@ drawing is transferred to the read@@ able program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device drawing of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , so helps a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries for the device labels for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the cardboard card General settings . here gi@@ b@@ ts do not have much to do . here can be an additional conversion to be defined . in our example everything is shown in the screens@@ hot as shown in the screens@@ hot .
&quot; only in case of non @-@ complete information , so that you will be informed if information about the tools of sampling ( tags ) are missing . &quot;
the box card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the machine must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; with the Internet to access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , is a &amp; CD ; entry found immediately that you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame or day entries , they can be changed easily . the directory / fil@@ es@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame it and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , it is possible to note : if you want to use everything manually , so dis@@ able the selection fields and free@@ DB is not used . however , this is about 620 MB big , consider these twice if this is worth to use . to be selected by free@@ DB in the offline mode , at least the first . the mode will be set on the following cart@@ on map . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data @-@ request , for the retri@@ eve of the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how does the system know which data will get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything as it is in the screens@@ hot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to page Fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look after a mirror server in your vicinity . this path , the burden will work between the machines . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work as much as it affects the server , as yet many fire@@ walls protocol consists of 88@@ 80 by default , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually is open to surf the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server transfer . the first attack box should be dis@@ able . &quot;
simply take the settings from the screens@@ hot . ( make sure the folder / tmp on your computer exists )
&quot; number of simultaneously read@@ able pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one available drive ? Parall@@ el@@ es Read and Ko@@ en ? the author does not know , therefore simply try . &quot;
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you are , the path / folder can be specified in which the W@@ AV files is stored , the box may not be applied in the private folder , if you don &apos;t want to make this folder if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; all to enter as it is in the screens@@ hot . the command is something long , under certain circumstances the command must be broken down to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio @-@ quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . it reached a good balance between audio @-@ quality and memory . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction on the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags may also be deleted at any later change of tags . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; meeting ( including the full path ) and the output format ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in the screens@@ hot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of simultaneously too codi@@ fication W@@ AV files : in a du@@ al@@ core or square , or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to code more than a W@@ AV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each output of a &amp; CD ; used . if you chose the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD is going on . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , which is described in the previous section , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data is described in this section , must be repeated for every out@@ going &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we use one &amp; CD , which is not included in free@@ DB , see the screens@@ hot photos a little different from those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully removed from free@@ DB de@@ for@@ ested data . therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually enter , instead of collecting them from the Internet . comments are shown on the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD has to be defined now ; in the drive that was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and its length in the window should be listed as in the screens@@ hot . this only when the &amp; CD was identified ; as audio CD , could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
if this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings .
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD was successfully fet@@ ched by the free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces are already filled and also the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key to your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can select the database entry that your opinion is best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the cross @-@ border for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialogue for settings ) , you can also manually trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have local database , but collect data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - entering the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD , according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the &quot; &quot; Re@@ bel title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; . &quot;
the artist does not need to be entered in the input field &apos; Lat@@ est title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments , the comment field of album , the comment field of the album will be used for comments that are common to all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the free@@ DB is the CD @-@ editor not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD Ed@@ itors . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD Ed@@ itors ( e.g. whether all words are happy with major letters or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of one piece , and only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 @-@ tags , you have unlimited field@@ length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; no one is allowed on the &quot; &quot; tab settings &quot; &quot; tab ; take a look in the section &apos; settings &apos; . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with him you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all co@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the Ko@@ di@@ erer to find more information .
&quot; simply select an entry , which obviously agre@@ es with the style of the per@@ missible CD ; this example is not important , as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or r@@ ap for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors appears and you will see that the fields are filled for the album already with the given data that we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . simply enter the title of the piece on any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and click the same way until you all the title data of the &amp; CD entered .
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB database . it is already sorted into one of these categories in the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list .
&quot; note that there are a check @-@ characters in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are so marked . only a simple click on the line swit@@ ched off the selection of the piece , or fill the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at one time . &quot;
was started by clicking on the button selection out of the reading process so this window appears to confirm . OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
&quot; click on the rider orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
&quot; this error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer , which you have not yet installed . pieces which were not successful with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here for example . have you checked whether you write writing to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred right after the end of the initial piece of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new record : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 to the format MP3 . thus you can read and code parallel . take note of the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has found no configuration settings to press this behavior . the only thing that is configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes to read and code . at powerful machines is the result unclear . the computer used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and code ( from however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is coded , and a third order is coded in queue . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be built with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; if you want to generate audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need com@@ pressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the Ko@@ di@@ erer of your choice . &quot;
&quot; these distri@@ butions are already familiar with CV@@ S . if you are already familiar with CV@@ S , you can already download an anonymous copy , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ package is included . if you read this , you probably have done it already ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to individuals who compiled from source files , and not for users who use the compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs when it runs once , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; one program calls for many different programs , has many varieties of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows the photos of different cart@@ on cards of settings and also contains comments for options that can be used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still to read on ? even if only the help menu after the initial launch of the program was rec@@ kl@@ ed without any cl@@ ue as it will continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially when the time of the program does not include audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what about it ? who this reads , has probably already started the program . it should look like this : &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author can not maintain this manual or change it . at least just after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he does not agree to this section and therefore agree with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange when it succeeded to pick you the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , you do not need this information but ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition to others he has had real @-@ time graf@@ ik and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ liz@@ ards of texts also some properties that do not have other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; supports support . &amp; k@@ mid ; supports also the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ aso@@ und project driver that is required for the CIS . AL@@ SA is used as soon as it supports a sequence .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the Li@@ ed@@ text on the screen with altern@@ ating color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the penet@@ rated buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI @-@ file of one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window on K@@ Mid can be drawn .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( songs or textures files ) . K@@ Mid automatically used the procedure used .
&quot; finish support . if you quit &amp; k@@ de ; during the passage of a song finish , K@@ Mid starts again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI @-@ syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the required song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a music piece , open it and hold the kno@@ b box in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play out of the menu piece or enter the Le@@ ert@@ aste . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid , one piece starts automatically , once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window ( with several pieces , they will be added to a collection and then down@@ stream each other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece of play , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the shelves . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to turn left and right of the templates . to change the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the kno@@ b break or select the menu entry into the menu piece , so breaks the play@@ back into the menu piece , so breaks the slide show while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the reproduction . &quot;
Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te can be saved on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use Tex@@ ter@@ eig@@ nis . some pieces use Tex@@ ter@@ eig@@ nis and again others both . some pieces have no text : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can adjust what events are to be presented and even better : the event type is automatically chosen to adjust the entry to a song , so you will automatically adjust the entry to an associated text selection . however , you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other kind . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a event type , select from the menu settings the entries of your entries or songs . the same feature also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you put together . these are set up in line . in this section you will see how you can use the collections efficiently .
to select a collection first opening the collection bearings . this can be found in the menu collection under the item ... click New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then indicate the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original one .
&quot; if you have more than a collection , you can adjust the ri@@ ots in the collectors &quot; collection . &quot;
&quot; into the temporary collection , all the songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . concerns you if you add a lot of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collectors &quot; collection . there you can add a song with the button . it appears in turn the file dialog , with which help you can select the required song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic add to the collection .
if automatic add to the collection is activated a piece by opening ( using File Open or drag &amp; drop ) automatically to the active collection .
&quot; if an automatic add to the collection is not enabled , the opening of a piece of the temporary collection is activated and installed . this collection then will continue to add @-@ opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection bearings , select the collection and the desired song and then click &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs can be played out . if you select the row from the sub@@ menu command of the menu collections , the songs are played in order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or remove or remove the order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to pick a song , select it in the collection points , or use the selection list above the Kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump on a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or press button arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song back , select the button @-@ previous piece , the entry forecast of the menu piece or press the button arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection bearings , select the collection and click the button Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as they are in leaving &amp; k@@ mid , not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ map general @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that syn@@ thesizer the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map which conver@@ ts all the events of the Type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in Events of the Type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus getting a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound@@ card , you do not need a MIDI @-@ map because all Sound@@ cards GM -@@ compatible are ( including A@@ we - and CIS -@@ cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file of hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that stores all necessary steps for the play of a piece of piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section that may appear as often as desired . however , that every appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to show that a section is beginning ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
in this section the patches of General MIDI can be formed on your specific keyboard . general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left @-@ left side of the equation may be ignored . it is believed that the GM -@@ patches in the correct order are subject ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all sounds that this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard supports example ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun t@@ apping . these include the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if now a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( thread ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term Drum patch of the patch is meant , with which every sound is a different pearl tool ( drum , basin , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) constitutes and not the one where the sound the sound height of the always same drum means ( like him some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to give as tones on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of the lines is very important , just as their availability . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first row .
key@@ maps are used mainly to form notes on the per@@ kus@@ sions channel . check out as an example the supplied key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to form some channels to other . if you want to switch to the first and the second channel , you can easily switch the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the perc@@ ussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi @-@ devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section therefore has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; N is the channel , which is shown on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map should use the name name for this channel , all events will be ignored on this channel will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case the patch is always used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful for example to always use the per@@ kus@@ sions patch on the per@@ l@@ ad channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ Rati@@ o gives to what the ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ events are multip@@ lied with the value , this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) is calculated and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file ( no dec@@ im@@ al@@ kom@@ mas ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting will be used because GM provides a keyboard that is to play a pitch @-@ ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , try some key@@ boards to play two tones up to an oc@@ tave . to try the right value on your keyboard , you must taste a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . these can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of piano ( one for any MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ ers you see which sounds are just being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument , the button is no longer green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played notes . view the view in the menu settings below the point channel view : settings
&quot; the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . if you find e.g. , a song be too quick to follow the text , you can slow down . to change the speed , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; . thus , the same MIDI file may result in two different devices to different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes on a very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I cannot force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while an mp3 file 4 MB needs a similar sound quality . in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a bin@@ der distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; having compiled the problem . to remove the problem you need to download a source code and install ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s main@@ page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; Drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
just activate the setting of automatic add to the collection . otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection .
&quot; you can click the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD , to rec@@ ede the reproduction . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD screen . &quot;
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; work floor a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this way I have to play a MIDI file ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file only in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn the setting of automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection &quot;
&quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . just want to play the first file and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then join B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid games and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have been sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , animated me this , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; at the moment I have been writing about my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect a bit of time . as hob@@ bies , I try to collect a bit of time . as hob@@ bies , I &apos;ve learned how to make MIDI files , music do and propositions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make a great pleasure when you send me a postcard from your home or an MID@@ I@@ - / Kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file ; however , if you want to contact me . before you get a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I already have the file already . &quot;
&quot; I have been &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time , and nobody would like to stress for this money . I would like to emphas@@ ise that I can only be more programmed because ... / if I come back feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi Iw@@ ai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Beh@@ a@@ unch of the error that the audio height at A@@ we cards was too high .

and of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net which give us this wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ oke files .
&quot; in addition to this can be found &amp; k@@ mid , which can be found at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . there is also links to pages with other car@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external syn@@ thesizer since the sound quality depends much on your sound@@ card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or an A@@ we card .
&quot; if you do not have a sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course hear no music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; features a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of the M@@ Player or PH@@ ON@@ ON supported formats , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; k@@ de ; on this computer it was installed .
for additional help please check out The KDE website to new releases or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
&quot; the application window is formed from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . op@@ tionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed when information is displayed in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to submit their favor@@ ed connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which are to be played after each other , so you should use the category Dau@@ ghter playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarch@@ ies . if you have an entry anc@@ akes , his group is copied and all its sub@@ groups to the current category , and the reproduction begins with the requested entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and perman@@ t playlist can also be changed by direct em@@ itting the XML configur@@ ations . of course , one can only do if &amp; km@@ player . of course , one can only do if &amp; km@@ player . of course , you can only do the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player . it is possible to select the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps . simply click on a name of a category , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu must be selected from the menu of the same with playlist , or chosen either of the editing mode , or another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes have lost if the editing mode , or another group is selected without having the playlist . &quot;
&quot; owing to the convenience of the author of &amp; km@@ player , some features can only be swit@@ ched by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; the animation at star@@ ters and berries can be disabled by using ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ c and change from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ struc@@ tor option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can easily be inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; km@@ player ; will be the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format needs to be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at Star@@ ten does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . this would be dis@@ rup@@ tive during the end of animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start animation may be the ad of a favourite photos : &amp; lt ; i@@ g = &quot; / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f = &quot; / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL shall be supported by &amp; km@@ . ;
there is a rider on the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; km@@ player . here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the cli@@ pping size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for error search is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of km@@ . here is the output of m@@ player visi@@ bly .
there is no rider for this playlist in the configuration dialog by &amp; km@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual mach@@ ining of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&quot; Flash &quot; can be played inside &amp; km@@ player ; it can even be played the special field Em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; to give you the &amp; km@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; D player has to reproduce the module as service provider for the m@@ ime type : / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the interior dialog file aggreg@@ ations of KDE . &quot;
&quot; the kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; km@@ player ; is in a consoles application and browse after error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . the gest@@ ating process is p@@ p@@ player . if there is no error , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; km@@ . ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , there is always been a pre @-@ checked back@@ end for a particular m@@ ime type ( naturally only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual de@@ es of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ c . for example , PH@@ ON@@ ON will repeat all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; features of TV cards can be played by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can manually be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to the configuration of the V@@ DR ( Video data records ) settings in the settings below - &gt; source - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port to use . there should be detected ports to be selected by one . the use of en@@ coding must be found out ( e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR can use only X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( presum@@ ably the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension ) for the X server needs to be functional for the X server ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; are used by KM@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time the emergence of this documentation are dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ cre@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the play@@ back of the playlist . &quot;
is there indications of how I can take my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root to carry out the device . this is absolutely sure that / dev / c@@ drom shows the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; X@@ ine only starts slowly , why has every time my CPU to be tested on their performance ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hol@@ ed. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interface and network support and becomes the comp@@ iling of &amp; k@@ ile ; required .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writings . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be attributed to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution should be included . for installation the documentation of distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are available on the k@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux . &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation is considered . however , the support to this project or its documentation is needed , the contact about the k@@ ile ; -@@ website should be made . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions about or with the compens@@ ate of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or become extensions , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment in a graphical interface and within this one simple , direct and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . furthermore , the possibility to complete , comp@@ iling , rep@@ elling and error tools for this . in conclusion , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project administration . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities to learn the manual should be attracted to Kate . users from &amp; k@@ ile ; you can start directly with reading the chapter &apos;s works with the editor of &amp; Kate ; start .
&quot; for lat@@ ex ; is the right expression : L@@ ay @-@ TECH , is able to use a La@@ ie ( engl@@ er lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros is also possible to use a La@@ ie ( engl@@ er lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros is that it is from the surname of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; just here is a good insight into &amp; lat@@ ex ; given it is not the ultimate book on this . to rule good ben@@ ding , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. Dal@@ y , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; just as other out@@ flow languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction with which the gener@@ alization properties like paper format , page numbered and text with the text . the introduction begins with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ Beg@@ in } . &quot;
the quick entry @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a great feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the document ( menu ) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document .
&quot; document ranges : this document describes the type of document document : article ( article ) , book &#91; review &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
coding : this is hereby set the string coding . it should use the character coding of the system . modern systems are increasingly using the UT@@ F @-@ 8 -@@ coding as a standard . b@@ room should be UT@@ F @-@ 8x ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Docum@@ ents ) .
this list contains the most used auxiliary packages for lat@@ ex ; for the integration they will be filled only in the cross @-@ box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document ranges from Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN @-@ Reg@@ ulations ) . you should always find the use of German texts . &quot;
new users are not worried either . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information can be found in the section .
&quot; B &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just as other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , attitudes and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . however , it is possible to notice some mathematical surroundings . however , it is possible through the hum@@ ble appearance of output level . however , you can also save it through the modest appearance of output . &quot;
&quot; using the automatic transmission of the environments , by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { Command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the associated line to the loop ( e.g. \ \ &apos; { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu , set ... La@@ TeX commands may be de@@ activated . &quot;
all documents are normally divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most important element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed and seen by a mouse @-@ click on the respective button . &quot;
&quot; in creating the own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be created very helpful . once a DVI ; -@@ File ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent File ) &#93; was created , jump &amp; k@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer on the appropriate line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document , and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the output output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , conversion and print of DVI ; files for various systems and straight . &quot;
&quot; when using the r@@ ens search , the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor is stored , the exact opposite of it . once on a section in the lat@@ ex ; the source code is cli@@ cked , is used for the corresponding position in the g@@ lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text is used to be the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewers . &quot;
Master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . using a Master document is simplified the work with other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project can be set up a project @-@ document project settings .
Travel@@ ing : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the source text is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed ( unless there are no errors in the source code ) .
file pressure : in this mode the DVI ; -@@ File is stored on a cell @-@ hand @-@ playing field and it is not a call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick@@ ness .
&quot; considering the processing range of tool@@ bar the three large @-@ wide selection fields are intended for the rapid integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
the drop @-@ field Fur@@ ther is for example of articles such as keywords , fu@@ eled banknotes or references . the options are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or different element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a specified name ( selection selection ) .
&quot; when entering the quot@@ ation , a selection list with liter@@ ary entries are shown . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors required . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e is used for laying down the writer , the main text , the joints , the chest@@ nut notes etc . they are the following scrip@@ tures : &quot;
&quot; in the call of &amp; k@@ ile , there are two choices for creating a new document by selecting documents and defined settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason to hand . &quot;
&quot; the brack@@ ets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font . will the scri@@ be determined not at the beginning , this may also happen to happen in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above code example was entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex has to be compiled . the easiest way to do is to use the men@@ Ã ¼ s B@@ auen or the kno@@ b . &quot;
the source text must be saved before the comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for the storage automatically .
&quot; resem@@ bles the comp@@ iling of the document , should be sought in the log according to the errors . when using quick@@ ness should be started &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; this is not the case , should also be considered the logging . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest@@ art document . for example , a report with the writing is created and only a few hours . the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ n { environment } . &quot;
the contents are only available within the environment ( of \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } to \ \ &apos; { environment } ) ; there is no circum@@ ference in an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities for the up@@ lifting of the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it can be used for example certain fonts , bold pressure , limited pressure , sub@@ missions , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands may end either with the command \ \ &apos; or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
&quot; \ \ Beg@@ in { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ v@@ ant and is long as long as long as he is closed with a \ \ , { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence may be presented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } cur@@ sive . &quot;
\ \ ratio : created a quot@@ ation in the document . the quot@@ ation begins with \ \ Beg@@ in { Rate } and ends with \ \ &apos; { Rate } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; an agreement , now follows a step @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; once in the wiz@@ ard a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . therefore , a quot@@ ation , a few places in the fat and cur@@ riculum and a poem for application come to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , using Editor @-@ View or Str@@ g E can be back to the editor ( with internal viewers ) . at an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI @-@ file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file can be converted . simply try and repair . &quot;
DVI ; is a framed file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi -@@ output like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ transform@@ ers or computer imaging . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the preparation of the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed correctly ( if the printer is correctly set ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar is the transformation of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the source code was created , the conversion can be changed into the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the fores@@ try finding the direct leap from the editor to the per@@ tin@@ ent position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ ed files . therefore only Modern on settings have to set up ... tools are well @-@ grown .
&quot; in order to locate the fores@@ try , the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor on a line of source code is positioned and decent on pre@@ f@@ ool search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewers will be done . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document by &amp; k@@ ile ; used to be specified in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; used as text editor ... editor )
&quot; should be shown at the case of quick @-@ making of the &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewer is not possible , there may be a mistake , this is displayed in the log file or in the news window summary . &quot;
&quot; the log file contains the error source in the source code . in the editor , the button file is always available in which the error appears . to be viewing the faul@@ ty line , must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once the corresponding button is cli@@ cked in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to choose from the template &apos;s template for the document . &quot;
&quot; if you choose from le@@ eres document , a document may be written either from scratch or the assistant for quick creation of a new document . further information can be included in the section . &quot;
&quot; users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates , can be saved in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either has to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be created or create a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using existing document and selection from the template &apos;s templates . &quot;
when creating a new document from a template using file New will replace some strings by other data ( e.g. name or character coding ) . these variables can be set in setting settings ... settings are set out .
&quot; when creating a template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings can be replaced by which variables : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ TO OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by the input in document class . typically , it will be used as : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ .@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
the easiest way to create a template is the use of assist@@ ants and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way the following steps were accomplished :
&quot; when creating a new document , the own template can then be grown instead of by default ones . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created , becomes a simple way to create a template , should be sought after one on the Internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; Kate ; uses &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibilities of reading and cur@@ ls of many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for Kate ; can be done in the men@@ Ã ¼ rich tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
&quot; to learn more info &amp; Kate ; and its features , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can you start directly with reading the chapter &apos;s works with the editor of &amp; Kate ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called for the men@@ ue description of La@@ TeX reference , which can be accessed by nearly all commands , which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use , as well as their syntax . &quot;
&quot; a double @-@ click with penet@@ rated shr@@ g key , for the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way the clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p is just \ par balanced . &quot;
&quot; when writing the text with penet@@ rated left mouse , the full text is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using arrow keys with penet@@ rated Um@@ br@@ alt taste , parts of the source code can be filled in the Ed@@ itor@@ window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the most diverse types of sources . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants can include an own type of book@@ marks within the text . it is a particular type of book@@ mark inside the text . the menu features are also highlighted , so that it is automatically generated with the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; the collabor@@ ator is probably one of the main as@@ pe@@ ers when using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; already outstanding possibilities , have been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important features for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands may include the following commands : &quot;
&quot; do a complete paragraph ( group of lines , which included on both sides a blank lines ) . with a paragraph , it is not included in the tables , and lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of sources . the only bow thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is therefore that the down@@ time passes through two blank lines are separated . &quot;
w@@ Ã ¤ h@@ ates the word under the current c@@ urs@@ or@@ position . this selection has also an advanced meaning as this command also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with an extended star ( \ \ ) and an individual star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; for example , a part of the document may be well balanced and by wir@@ es the key de@@ f . &amp; Kate ; offers the short@@ cut cur@@ ly C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire row is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with its own commands , as well as ac@@ ing removal are the following commands to contain the layout of the text : &quot;
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description on editing cells .
it has already been pointed out that environments a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders in editing environment for a short @-@ eye simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command the current environment is stimul@@ ated in the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly before the command to protect the environment .
with this command the end of the current environment is stimul@@ ated ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the command to the car@@ ols of the surroundings .
&quot; if the c@@ ursor from or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surroundings } is located , becomes the end of the surroundings ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many mer@@ ging environmental command can be lost quickly of the country &apos;s back soon . this command close the most beautiful surroundings , so that the w@@ ron@@ eous ambient structure is not destroy . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups , which are determined by brack@@ ets { ... } . under editing TeX Group are a few important commands , which correspond to those from editing environment . &quot;
with this command the current group will be ges@@ tures ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the har@@ med brack@@ ets .
&quot; with this command , the current group will ges@@ tures ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the pe@@ eled brack@@ et . &quot;
&quot; if the c@@ ursor from or behind the soft cl@@ amps of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , will be donated to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the input of many w@@ aged @-@ brack@@ ets can be lost quickly of the left @-@ out group . this command close the most recent group , so that the w@@ ron@@ eous structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups are not destroy . &quot;
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple instructions are used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign for two simple instructions are used in &amp; k@@ ile ; also for the sign of the attraction is the sign &quot; used . &amp; k@@ ile ; does not know this case and add two close instructions for lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic set of double occupancy can be set under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ TeX - and retired .
it also can also be used L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ der@@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and thus German or French can be used as well . there are also many more languages available .
&quot; in the pressures of Shift ; input c@@ aste &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent for@@ ef@@ al erup@@ tion . if the current position is located within a lists of an area ( e.g. enum@@ er@@ ate or item@@ ize ) , for example , not just a po@@ king surface , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; inside a tables , you slept &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ attached to an end @-@ line ends . &quot;
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments to be supported by settings ; set up ... La@@ TeX add .
&quot; some users complain the columns in tables environments , and all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) ; search ; searches &amp; k@@ ile ; after the n@@ ist Tab@@ ulator in the following line . although this tab@@ ulator is not the same , for the columns of the current tab . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code has been completed , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for lat@@ ex ; ) there are three ways to set up different modes of work . all these modes can set up different ways of working under settings ... complete . &quot;
&quot; when the beginning a new environment means using the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surroundings } and k@@ ile ; automatically the command \ \ , { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; the last letter of the entry is removed , the last letter of the entry is removed and what is the complete list . on the other hand , the list may also be used by entering another letter even smaller . &quot;
&quot; all commands will be written with a short description of their parameter . alternatively , the descriptions are covered by selecting a command . alternatively you can also jump off by &amp; k@@ ile ; also jumping marks can be introduced , so that a simply jump to these positions by using mus@@ es jumping marks can be included and the required parameters then can be introduced . &quot;
&quot; set up under settings ; setup ... k@@ ile , complete settings to these lists can be made . it can be different w@@ au@@ ds for r &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands , as well as guar@@ dians of the general language @-@ to @-@ use . &quot;
&quot; the instruction mode is for the reduction of environments not n@@ ested . it will always have a few letters associated with \ \ Beg@@ in , and the call of the completion . on the other hand , the environments will be used as often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for completion of the environments . &quot;
&quot; in the call of the complete processing mode , the menu of the processing of the environment is automatically covered and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in { . afterwards , the ambient temperature may be continued at simpl@@ est way and by pressing the entry . &quot;
&quot; after this is accomplished , the environment is automatically re@@ closed . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recogni@@ zes that it is a list of lists and is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
under settings k@@ ile ; setup ... k@@ ile ; complete settings to be made to these lists . this mode uses the value @-@ list of the complete mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; supports user @-@ defined lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which can immediately be replaced by L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ g@@ ere strings . as an example of a subscription list , the file exam@@ ple@@ .c@@ wl , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ TeX is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word is inserted in the complete processing mode , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ TeX . &quot;
&quot; cru@@ de , for automatic transmission is not helpful . however , that many miracles are written in a document more than once . this offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the reduction for all already written work@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in the men@@ ue Settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile amplifier , which can also be specified here . here also the swelling can be defined by the indication of the completion . &quot;
&quot; the processing files can be installed at the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / c@@ ile / c@@ ile / c@@ ile / the pers@@ ist @-@ folder ) , dic@@ tionary ( whi@@ p @-@ book ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as simple as possible . to protect the bases for the graphics formats , the sections should be observed and desp@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for rein@@ forcement and re@@ arrangement of pages . will the PDF -@@ output will be re@@ arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to be able to pay the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the men@@ Ã ¼ s creating comp@@ iling , creating and create view . &quot;
&quot; for the comp@@ iling of the source texts for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used the short@@ cut of the viewer ; or the other conversion can be used in the standard @-@ hand viewer ; 3 times , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and using old ; 5 the PS file can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; when using the command quick , a spect@@ ator is called after the comp@@ iling . should not be used in an un@@ mistak@@ able viewer , each time a new window will be displayed . &quot;
a new project will be asked for the project &apos;s new project .... in this case the following information is asked for the project :
&quot; when the fil@@ en@@ ame -@@ window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the clo@@ cks of EC@@ MAS@@ cript -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts can be managed in the sen@@ k@@ right no@@ ste .
the API scripts have not yet been developed and can be found in more versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
&quot; first , the first must be said that the publication of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods : &quot;
&quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite distinctive system , in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of different packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support the user . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . these include documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; a full @-@ filled refer@@ r@@ z for &amp; tex ; and its e@@ â with such a few important packages ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is perfect for a certain form@@ atting . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , the fin@@ s of the right document does not always offer . as a real help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which includes a database with all the documents and below a graphical surface area . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the great advantage is the search for par@@ cel names or stroke . by &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are shown .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the bed of the Le@@ ert@@ ank the viewer for the document .

output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time when said pro@@ c .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked out how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there is now a great graphical interface for this . &quot;
&quot; if the just opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then they simply leave the current work@@ folder . if not , then select the current work@@ folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is available . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on screen , their file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;

enter the name of the file as the result is to be named . the file is usually stored in their home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pers ; invite you to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . therefore , the plug @-@ ins can be immediately benef@@ ited from the additional functionality and must not wait until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI , elements . more about it can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install an plug @-@ in or part @-@ part , we begin with the menu plug @-@ ins . thus , the following dialogue will open : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage and add new plugins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search ad . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in .
often work on one project several individuals in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project characteristics can be configured .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nickname is the nickname of the user and serves to be clear identification .
&quot; one member may have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as sub@@ project manager . &quot;
&quot; the user can choose from the list of the team members who he is . this happens when he looks the team member from the list , and the button will be shown as presses . the currently selected member ( her identi@@ ties ) appears , after which you are : text . &quot;
the names and setting of their own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for more information about comments .
&quot; besides the overview of your team , there is another advantage by the capture of members of the team : it can be created an event to the team manager when something particular happens . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that will be executed when something particular occurs in the project . an example would be the record of the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen , or the sending of a message when a file is saved , or a script that is added to the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event Con@@ figuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings Dialog@@ es can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the address selected by the addres@@ see . the addres@@ see can be a team - or sub@@ project manager . see where such lad@@ der can be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
notes to type is simple . it can be chosen either the note -@@ associated entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary box followed by cont@@ acting text .
&quot; notes may be sent to a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case the syntax of the team member states ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the nickname manager of the team leader in the following possibilities : team manager of sub@@ project leaders should be specified in the area of the following possibilities : team manager and sub@@ project leaders , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nickname and roles names are independent of large or small @-@ time , but id@@ ols to cl@@ as@@ ps and the : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ atting languages , the DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic is supported and web@@ based form@@ atting and scripts . &quot;
&quot; the settings are available via the settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by settings of Qu@@ anta . diesel dialog extends over some pages that will be treated to each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for tags including car completion can be modified there@@ . the entries are :
&quot; large / small @-@ scale of tags : big / to@@ oth@@ cul@@ ation of automatic tags . normal great / petty @-@ term means , the tags will be inserted as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / large number of attributes : big / to@@ oth@@ ed of attributes . normal great / v@@ elling means , the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if cancelled , is optional for tags , for which the final day optional is optional , this immediately after the tag ; added . &quot;
not optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags except the simple tags .
&quot; Start@@ - and end @-@ day automatically update : if swit@@ ched , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic acquisition of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of ac@@ z@@ entu@@ ated signs into the appropriate coding during the entry .
&quot; M@@ IME types : Mim@@ eti@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . by using the standard , the default show can be recovered . &quot;
standard string coding : the coding of newly created or in other ways than with file opening @-@ opening files ( where the coding of the file can be over@@ looked ) . this setting here is used by the same in the project Properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D was not recognized . this setting here is used by the same in the project Properties , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regularly backup copies , so that in a black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program , this is not the same as the saving of the file . also for not stored documents a backup is regularly created , according to the specified time . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Ed@@ itor@@ bar or an own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time . &quot;
ben@@ ding the window settings back to the next start is useful when the user interface came through to change the M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout Command system parameters .
the war@@ nings range serves the taxes of the possibility to switch the display of war@@ nings by dis@@ ks by no more inquiries .
&quot; the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can display the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the syn@@ cing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in its shared mode . &quot;
&quot; here , the Par@@ ser and the struc@@ tur@@ baum , which represents the picture of the Par@@ ser @-@ node in the document , in details . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse click on the struc@@ turing , the following action is possible to change the process by clicking on the struc@@ turing . &quot;
&quot; in the area of struc@@ turing settings , the visibility of knots in the tree can be assigned automatically . blank knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such , in which the current document has not been found . &quot;
&quot; the area to forti@@ fications from abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which are subject to extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are valid in groups , each one can give for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ cl@@ ause abbrevi@@ ation is different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plugins are the part @-@ applications of the third page that can be used by each sound @-@ capable application , most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not at a stand there as $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
&quot; input : this information will be transferred to the plugin when you start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ esis &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is refused . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the store when this option is not chosen . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the check @-@ out information is correct , then if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the error search was completely new . the support for the no longer necessary built &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was implemented as well as the support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of which a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin has been implemented , the various Impl@@ ement@@ ations has been made available . &quot;
&quot; currently , only a plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable Debug@@ ger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the Debug@@ ger plugin &apos;s options can be changed the specific settings .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional items appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of surveillance variables is displayed . usually appears in the left Dock .
&quot; a view , in which all brack@@ ets are listed , with po@@ ets numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower Dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower Dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or she shares the plug @-@ in with , on Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ y . this action is opened by default , when a project is opened , so that a de@@ bu@@ gger must not be respected . &quot;
the counter@@ part to de@@ bu@@ ck session Star@@ te the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the bo@@ wer according to requirements .
sends a HTTP @-@ request to the server for a de@@ bug requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to see the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the View Debug@@ ger issue .
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script to begin to send information about the surveillance variables as well as the current line . if this happens when the script is stopped , the execution will be continued before a de@@ bit claim has started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script to send without information about surveillance variables and the current line number . if this happens when a script is stopped , the execution continues before a de@@ bit request begins , the execution as soon as a request is placed . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script without entering the functions or includes .
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script when possible in functions and includes disp@@ atch .
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to move the directive and go to the next so , as if there was the current . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog , where a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitoring value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable . &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keit@@ h Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ sl@@ db@@ g that can be found at http : / / x@@ sl@@ db@@ g.@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many more works of Keit@@ h .
&quot; this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to suit your needs , and how you can be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to better get better . &quot;
&quot; documentary type E@@ di@@ tier@@ pack@@ ete ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scripts . your simplicity and flexibility is made of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script @-@ languages and the tool@@ bar . day files contain two fil@@ yp@@ es , the &amp; D files , which can insert images and instructions faster in a document than a user per . &quot;
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from an existing DT@@ D . see in for details of conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how XML files are to create , then the &amp; D p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bar . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; day XML files ( .@@ day ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the DIY di@@ alog@@ es , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort ; for the day shows the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even material tools allow a fast introduction of tags to a document without any risk of typ@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; day folder are nothing but a folder . they contain only the &amp; D files . day folder carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 @-@ binding ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so many users have better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is placed in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of an un@@ XML document . it can only contain once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains only one element type over itself nothing else . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the meeting class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type meth@@ od is valid . there is the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ Day determined . this is an only element type element .
&quot; describe an attribute of a tags . this element can only exist for any attribute . additionally , there are other tags which describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an only element type element . &quot;
is the source used for filling out sources for the attributes of the day @-@ Ed@@ itor@@ dialog and in the attribute @-@ tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a methodology . the arguments that will be handed over to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag allows the elements of a list together . it may occur for an attribute . it is only one @-@ elementary type element .
sets the position of the attribute a tags within a dialogue . this day can occur for any attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ Day ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this element is empty .
returns a list of elements that may occur within the on defined tags . this element is an only element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ De@@ ad@@ ation begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ coding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and need to be ch@@ ased and closed .
&quot; space affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to review the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is up in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ windows to launch and over@@ test Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , the verification will only be carried out during charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
in the following an example of a family 1 @-@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for these Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ atics .
in the following an example of a working family 2 @-@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of these Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ day .
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ coding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; _ name &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; ; / day &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; B p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is quite simple and there is an editor for this , accessible via DT@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite DT@@ D settings . this may be di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D ( HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nickname = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not stated , the name will be used as a nickname . &quot;
an action can set up with settings ... click on new action leads to the same dialogue :
the key@@ chain of this promotion can be assigned a key@@ chain ; with one of one is the current short@@ cut remot@@ ely .
the simpl@@ est promotions . it can be inserted in the Det@@ ai@@ ed settings and in execution of the action this text is inserted in the document on the current c@@ ursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that may change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . yourself are the quick@@ start -@@ dialogue or the various See in ... promotions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Home / my@@ Home / my@@ Home / my@@ Home . &quot;
although qualified paths are permitted is it recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; trial method is used when D@@ CO@@ P is used on the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script is used .
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above methods , a script input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can take over to the standard inser@@ tion . in the drop @-@ field input may be determined , which is to send to the standard inser@@ tion . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input is normally only with this setting useful .
&quot; according to the entry may also be led to the output of the used application . there are two kinds of issue : normal edition , on the default output . it can be indicated what is to be done with which to the standard output written text is set out by the value the check@@ box issue is set : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a custom tool@@ bar . in any case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add promotions and configure . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the proper tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the day Attri@@ bute has and you plan their use , enable dialogue &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; if available , so that a input when using the action is possible . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? do we replace it , before we have difficulty . &quot;
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ download ; use from the &amp; menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ download ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose editing size to others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I have decided to create a start kno@@ b as a symbol . due to the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled ; -@@ day in the current document will insert . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this happens over the menu with settings ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . besides the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder , in which the stored symbol is stored , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the use button and continue with other tags , so there are or confirm with OK to finish . &quot;
suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ functions to the tool@@ bar supplement or it should set it for better overview of some of the flo@@ ps in several groups . open the tool@@ bar set up dialogue on settings &apos;s tool@@ bar . place sure that the tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; I want to choose the tr@@ den@@ omin@@ ator ( very left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the den@@ omin@@ ator support group@@ ing . anyone who knows my tool@@ bar could not know that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or , button the opposite of the start button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ ving of all symbols , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; back up in the right folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be im@@ regular folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be saved in the correct folder , so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) if a file is open from the appropriate type . &quot;
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for normal users is the opportunity to add documentation for the scripts language or the form@@ atting language that you love most . that &apos;s why I describe this chapter as I have a &amp; PHP ; -@@ Docum@@ entation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory check whether someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for the format - / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you have to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you , the second we treat here . &quot;
&quot; # KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , to the D@@ Oc@@ um@@ entation HTML Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3@@ .html ... &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Cont@@ ext@@ List 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html ... &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Cont@@ ext@@ List 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html &quot;
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is something : &quot;
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 sets = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = In@@ tro@@ duction ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ synchron@@ tax@@ .html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for chess tel@@ esc@@ ort ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you notice that the content directory has been refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ential in the upper end of the building view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
&quot; space affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource @-@ based files . &quot;
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file used to the design of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script displays the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file @-@ line head@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c simply and save $ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you set it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that this good and it &apos;s worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best Web@@ developers platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; are you not alone . it is possible to share the ver@@ able resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else to whom . at different places there is an email to send menu item , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts . &quot;
&quot; resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pers ; -@@ users are reviewed and only available when our team needs them as accurate and usable for the publication . to make use of the resources it provides a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of resources is ensured , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; in the up@@ loading , you are asked for your passport for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you may need to pass multiple keys . in dialogue new resource you have to stay empty ) and will be launched by OK the high @-@ load . &quot;
&quot; the high load can upload from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) to upload the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before the installation , studied &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the im@@ pedi@@ ment of the resource by exam@@ ining the integrity and the signature . if the integrity given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which is currently not produced by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this creation may be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files may be necessary in the day XML format . there is the easiest way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started by the DT@@ D charging and conver@@ gence of a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which is to be used . afterwards , the following dialog will appear : &quot;
target directories : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Final line : the string , which in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Day , such as HTML Public - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P according to conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after the conversion the &amp; steel p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . to be able to understand and understand the full benefit of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this chapter tries to bring them precisely to these concepts , without understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pers ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the work area divided into three areas : global , local and proj@@ ections . this distinction involves a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; use , available . from tool@@ bar over actions , everything as global marked , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administr@@ ators to secure tool@@ bar , actions and patterns in the global tree , which can then be available to each in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bar . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a particular project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns up to tool@@ bar with special promotions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all the elements are stored in the folder @-@ tree of the project , making the sharing of special tools and patterns of all staff within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Ed@@ itor@@ window , the buil@@ ders , the boxes with information and the tool@@ bar . please hit , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the cardboard box with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current docum@@ enting entries , as close the current , other or any cart@@ on , re @-@ load or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S command to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click on the Ed@@ itor@@ is lead to a further context menu regarding the advertis@@ ment document , such as basic editing steps ( output / paste / paste ) , for the word under the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor or opening of the file , when the string is called under the mouse @-@ mouse file . &quot;
&quot; at the upper end of the Ed@@ itor@@ is the tool@@ bar of the Ed@@ itors . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bar is shown . in the course of further exp@@ ul@@ ent of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; will the tool@@ bar adapted to new functions and associated users . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bar is really easy . if they want to insert one day , e.g. &amp; lt ; it is the symbol that represents the day . now , you can insert the data for this just day , then click on a day that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the buil@@ ders ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , they are to open and sc@@ rap . in the presentation with cardboard boxes stand for files , project , designs , attributes , attributes , attributes , and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view points all files in the project and allows the pamper@@ ing files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions like adding , removal , high @-@ load or delet@@ ing the files from the memory medium can be carried out using the text menu . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , programme , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all possibilities open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what connection they are used . the category is always available , local templates are available only for the respective users and templates in projects are only available in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of break@@ down in Global , Local and project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can send the available information to a script . over the right mouse button , you can order more functions , such as the script to start or send with an e @-@ mail . &quot;
with this view one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on a module the c@@ ursor on the position of the element is set to the position of the element . by law clicks a module opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
&quot; this tree appears under the other construction sites . with it can change some attributes and nam@@ entation , which allows the modification of all available attributes with a few clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation to find the web technology for your development . you can download documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the documentary site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added and considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ els at the lower end of the window , via the beneficial information can be reached : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this cart@@ on contains information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . so , for example , the DT@@ D will display the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D . &quot;
&quot; this cardboard box shows all the errors in the market up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bar are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command displayed . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to define . &quot;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with an e @-@ mail . send the tool@@ bar as com@@ pressing t@@ ar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an e @-@ mail ; like any other secure and load it !
it &apos;s reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ files on your system will be adjusted . to get a complete list of options available to the configure script . to understand a complete list of all options . the options are easy to understand and not run here .
&quot; if you have problems when starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a Web development tool optimized for KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a well @-@ balanced development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor to create the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; what would be , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able Mark@@ up language editor would be ? well , this would make him absolutely the greatest Web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; yet , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore , should be the most suitable &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim has to be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development cooperation . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so , in good use of free software , the idea of Why developers , what does someone else developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; rum@@ ors is not only this all possible , but allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web@@ developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity . by means of self @-@ coated actions , scripts and tool@@ bar , the automation is able to notice almost every task . by the program coma , they can notice &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ins ; ( more about it can be found in . ) &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web@@ development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast design development and was quickly expanded to a well @-@ effective editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .

&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time , if you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project pre @-@ storage folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts with inser@@ ting out of the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters for the &amp; HTML ; - proceeding , so that it is displayed correctly and will not be understood by the browser as a form@@ atting instruction . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; - proceeding , which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day . &quot;
switch the block selection from or off . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of &amp; Shift ; taste .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; script error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .

presents a dialog to add files to the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory to new files that might be there . that allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or a sub@@ folder and then add it to the project .
load the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport method depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more inputs / output emo@@ k ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .

a dialog to store your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved through settings , by means of tool@@ bar or you will be asked if you want to store the tool@@ bar whether you want to store the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; a tool@@ bar from the visible range . it does not delet@@ es them from the hard disk . if you have not yet saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do it . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send her own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team , so that the tool@@ bar present in the next publication is ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bar to the main server , where everyone can access it . see . &quot;

&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the current tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day adaptation dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags always present , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activated the smart inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . smart inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is refused when this day contradi@@ cts the rules on this place . &quot;

a dialog will appear in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar or to add and the sequences can be changed .
&quot; this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor , but it is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is free available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use the help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled at the best from above down , as for the filling out of the project called the whole directories structure for the rest of the project automatically complete . all these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties can be adjusted later . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example foo . when entering name , file is automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine on which you want to access , except you can edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if one can empty this field empty , the default settings of the chosen log file is used . depending on the setting of the remote host could be an adaptation necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , in which the templates for the project will be saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a shared collection of files used for various projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , in which the tool@@ boxes are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . if a shared collection of files used for various projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to include files from the local file system into the project . it can be selected multiple files or whole folder .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static we@@ ars you want to download and change . at ser@@ vers@@ ei@@ tigen script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) one must proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; thus , if files found themselves somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started to new , not an@@ h@@ ack . &quot;
&quot; with this option all the files and folder are displayed within the main folder , and you can make an exact choice after cou@@ p@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by An@@ h@@ anger or , by removing the her@@ kins , cl@@ as@@ ps from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project @-@ properties in the sub @-@ window profiles in the sub@@ window profiles or with the short@@ cuts Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional items will be explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames is possible to read a list of data @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; suppl@@ ementary option to top , even files , which are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
the project view which is loaded on the opening of the project . in more about project views can be read .
&quot; in this way , the desired Debug@@ ger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed you can find in . the Debug@@ ger Plugin can be adjusted with the button options . in the error search will be described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , up@@ loading profiles can be adjusted , as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile , by pointing out an own construction view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; you can switch to or delete these actions in the sub@@ window event , change or delete these actions when a particular event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can currently not affect you . &quot;
to open a different project , select project open ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be automatically saved . they are asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
project construction gives free access to the files in the project . you can manage the files in the current project .
&quot; folder are likewise , however , the entries are opening Open and Open with ... in the right button of the right mouse @-@ click menu @-@ menu : &quot;
&quot; here , various profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ loading files . see . &quot;
&quot; allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile is available , the button will termin@@ ate to prevent the removal . &quot;
the password will be kept in the core memory and forget about programs . this possibility is useful when most common up@@ loading files needed and the rather un@@ secure password will not be displayed on the record option .
&quot; this will stop the transmission , or simply leave the dialog , if you change your opinion before the up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ mounted profiles can be created , and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded on different servers . during editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the server , to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work . &quot;
the transfer protocol for the high load . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; to choose file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
&quot; the port for the transfer . usually , this must not be changed except the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety shaft this is either a time @-@ saving function or risk . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so it can not be easy to read , but everyone with programming can be easily seen in the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is just one set of files and tool@@ bar . it can give in a project many views , i.e. by simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bar can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , open or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own working method . &quot;
as mentioned above are the tool@@ bar designed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best about the menu tool@@ bar designed . use and add the tool@@ bar is treated down in the section &quot; Add &apos;s tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar and the symbols can be adjusted either by means of the context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with new action , a new tool@@ bar can be set out , which may be specified in dialog , where actions can be specified in dialogue , where actions can be visible on this or other tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additional items will remove action and appear to be displayed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings materials ... and settings set out .. adjusted .
&quot; templates are essentially document@@ s@@ able , code cut@@ ters and files to the link@@ . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used in principle as a common file system with exp@@ and@@ able organization and interfaces . you can copy , postp@@ one or any existing folder available in the pre @-@ stock tree ; in about the restrictions you pres@@ et for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included conditions have conditions for their use . please read the conditions displayed at the beginning of each template above the usage .
&quot; binary is all that not pur@@ er text is . it can be added any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . bin@@ aries are usually included in documents by means of link@@ ages ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . further information on the templates is available in documents . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally a simple rum@@ ors for the purpose and organized the work in appropriate ways to be efficiently . some examples can be found in the preliminary tree under global templates . see in more information on the templates . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful when not a new document based on a template , but the same text area is always included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base . some examples are found in the pre @-@ stock tree under global templates . see in more information on the templates . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a zi@@ pped tar . at present , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure after popularity ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose file As template , save as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this has happened , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project position ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the pre @-@ building tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File to save sel@@ ections as local / Project account . alternatively , the selection can easily be drag@@ ged with pul@@ ling and compart@@ ments to the construction super@@ visor . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy into a pre @-@ storage folder . it can be used all file management functions , so as pul@@ ling , or inser@@ tion using the file tree of kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder right in the file tree or in the project files to select a folder on the right and secure site template , secured a name for the template and secure . by default the project folder is guaranteed , but of course it can be saved as local or global template . &quot;
project templates enable a very oriented pre @-@ oriented advance . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or combine dynamic with &amp; PHP ; additionally you can use some things when using templates in projects very profound in mind .
the pre @-@ storage structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / an and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / qu@@ anta / an inst@@ inct files . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of tanks , as explained above . &quot;
&quot; to set the behaviour of a folder , click on the folder , click the folder and select in the context menu . the following dialog will appear : &quot;
&quot; a selection with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is ab@@ sent , as soon as El@@ ter@@ ous Attri@@ bute contrac@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts to everything except the stem folders . if a stem folder would be dis@@ able , unless it would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear to appear with something like text construction . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a stem folder . &quot;
&quot; permitted and submitted text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and enables copying contents to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers , a whole presentation already with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you have a text menu ( which show the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or paste and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor used via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source text editor in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
&quot; the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or XHTML , and a c@@ ursor appears . then you can edit and when needed for the source code editor , in which the changes carried out in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code . &quot;
&quot; working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; there is no plans to change this behaviour . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly as the first , except that simultaneously the changes are visible both in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor editor , this mode is already active , this mode is already active , connecting the active c@@ ursor from one window to the other , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
&quot; the synchroni@@ zation was set up between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor , you can choose between synchroni@@ zation by a click or automatically . in the selection automatically the time period can be adjusted . basically , the recommendation : a small ch@@ anne for fast computer and a large sp@@ line for slow . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so is tools of document properties . thus , the processing of un@@ visible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will also be called once a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will also be called to change the reduction of the pad@@ locks . this allows you to change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. &quot; &quot; keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressures of the two buttons below or removed . one click on the list allows the content of the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and key@@ word key wor@@ t@@ 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design the out of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete a change on the list is exactly as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style pre @-@ board , by pressing on the file button button and select the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the c@@ urs@@ ors is like in a text processing , possible by filling with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the c@@ ursor is different . the mark@@ ings works as usual . text can be inserted by single buttons , and be deleted by means of back@@ taste or removal . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ ting tags will be made in the same way over the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor , made . it is to be noted that the inser@@ ting of tags previously already exists , e.g. when a anchor drops , surrounded by text , each other surrounding anchor needs to be removed . &quot;
some tool@@ bar as the tables Assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they will later be used in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will be used later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists work must be used .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining Stil@@ ts . unlike other programs for Stil@@ ts , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the sty@@ ling situation can be pursued . &quot;
&quot; to be able to compile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successfully compile , except &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ ar and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are available at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already exist . &quot;

x@@ sl@@ db@@ g is using the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path@@ ways . fil@@ en@@ ame in the same folder as the top loaded style pre @-@ name with rel@@ ativ@@ ly path to the work@@ station con x@@ sl@@ db@@ g is used for example a stylish pre @-@ stor@@ ery .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is possible for example :
&quot; in this command this command is checked on a partial or complete agreement with a pre @-@ age called QNAP , or a given model name . &amp; eg ; template agre@@ es with any QNAP ME , which contains the string template . &quot;

&quot; there are many graphic tools for compar@@ isons . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly , why I wrote . &quot;
the con@@ duction was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time had corrected a lot of places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts with it .
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the modified lines , but I could not see what changed within this line . and there was no evidence on the places where maybe only the one @-@ re@@ ation had changed . that changes these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , each lot of other useful features were added . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare text for example , just copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it to one of the compar@@ ing window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons , and run by folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full file browser . &quot;
also 3 @-@ ways mer@@ ging will be fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently of each other in one piece of co@@ de and changes the original file . in this editor you can even edit the result . in this editor you can even edit the result . in this editor you can even edit the result . the screens@@ hot shows three qu@@ ell files in the following :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also with the compar@@ isons and assem@@ ble the folder . this screens@@ hot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder summ@@ ers :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and adher@@ ed to the possibilities of today &apos;s possibilities . if you often have to check Ko@@ en , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tablets are visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see in a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no hass@@ le , if J@@ em@@ and changes . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file different is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can easily make yourself the animal work by simply write the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; diff@@ use 1 folder 2 @-@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder , &quot;
&quot; opening dialog allows the manual type of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting over the file browser ( File ... ) or select a last modified file from the listing . you do not need to specify a third file , if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files . &quot;
&quot; using the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the compar@@ isons is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if mer@@ ging it is crossed , the input field is active for the purpose and can edit . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately set out a output bill . you can save this step later when saving . &quot;
the setup button will open up a dialogue with settings . here you can set options before you start with the compar@@ isons .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text compare . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allowing you to get some files from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active compar@@ ing window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog , you don &apos;t need to select any files you can simply close the dialog with the breaking button . &quot;
you can also use drag@@ ging and distr@@ ust : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes , a file for example contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you would only need two relevant files to download it in &amp; diff@@ use ; now you can simply copy the relevant sections easy , insert and then compare . &quot;
note : currently you can &apos;t draw anything out of k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case of text is supported by text in a compar@@ ative window .
warning : some editors interpret the pul@@ ling and exp@@ ose of text into another program as a cut and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the Info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the po@@ len@@ ding number of the first visible line in the window . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest a while on the line . then a small aid window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source @-@ windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , one sees the color that distingu@@ ishes itself . if both files differ , the pre @-@ set color is different . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) good to see . &quot;
&quot; links next to the text is the Com@@ prehen@@ sive column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming where white characters will not be so important , it &apos;s useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + Z. B. are white characters only in strings and comments , relevant for pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line which separates the inter@@ fac@@ tions column of the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line surface is activated , the line is displayed in the surrounding lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the compar@@ ative windows ) also has an Info @-@ line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; altered &#93; when you edited the result . usually it contains through the automatic merge text , but often it contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ solved is the saving de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons Spr@@ inge to the smallest dis@@ solved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ isons will be used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows , the display of the group will be shown in all windows , and the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows . ) This group will then be the current group . it is highlighted with the color wall@@ papers for current areas and each other on the left is a black beams . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , through the automatic mer@@ ging or by manual editing , no further line will be left in the source ; there is only a space @-@ holder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps again choose another source . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a mark@@ ings that you might want to copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; interaction conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this feature . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources numbers numbers ignore or ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates mainly with the image ones and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard left , right , high , clean , side , side , end , end , pri@@ g @-@ beginning and stra@@ g end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the over@@ hau@@ ts column can be used by and then click to the N@@ avi@@ rus . &quot;
&quot; in the Aug@@ ab@@ ef@@ en@@ ster you can also use the other keys to manipul@@ ate . with the inser@@ ting key , you can switch between inser@@ tions and surplus mode . ( previous is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the inter@@ fac@@ tions columns syn@@ ced the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section ) and explains the ed@@ itable output level .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , for the next / previous conflict ( str@@ g @-@ image up@@ ward ) , or to the next / previous conflict continue to be seen as a conflict . therefore , it must be differenti@@ ated between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings in the cli@@ p@@ board , you must press the copying button ( C@@ g @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ inser@@ ting ) . if this option is automatically collected , automatically to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying drops . be careful with this option but be careful , because you could not acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; Zei@@ len@@ ding are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix varieties are using a for@@ len@@ ding machine \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 ret@@ ains the Zei@@ len@@ ding source files , that &apos;s why you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored in the next start . ( menu adjustment - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set ... )
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with vari@@ ably width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences in cur@@ si@@ ver is represented . if the selected Scrip@@ tures are not supported , nothing has happened at all . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colours , some colours could not be available in its pure form but would be displayed . on these systems the button Settings is automatically an odd color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , when pressing the tab@@ ulator button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press entry or return , the inser@@ tion of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy into the cli@@ p@@ board falls then . &quot;
you can choose which for@@ ting type you prefer to save . the selected value is the generally common selection of the operating system .
&quot; with the compar@@ isons of files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines in the source files can be found . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters will not be ignored . also , white characters are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car sign &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ use &apos; \ &apos; in the end of one line , but then you may save files with different sizes in the page @-@ side comparison , however they may be activated using different sizes . if this option is activated , whi@@ ch@@ marking must be activated . during the default one must be disabled . in the default setting this option is de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis are numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; - &apos; ) the differences are still displayed , but they will be treated like white characters . &quot;
in the default setting this option is disabled . changes in commentary will be treated like changes in white characters .
&quot; intensi@@ vely looking for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and big files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the Autom@@ atic @-@ jumping mode , this setting determines how long the results of the selection is shown , before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; resol@@ ves automatic all conflicts in white characters by selecting the chosen file as a source . if you need this only from time to time , then use the functions of voters a / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options are not ignore or ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . &quot;
these options are covered in the chapter to scanning and lead a con@@ duction . look for details under documentation to the directory comparison and con@@ duction .
&quot; if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version exists the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already there is such back@@ up@@ file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , this will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; changing the language of the user interface . the change of this option does not affect the current program . you need to end up and rest@@ art this option . ( this option is in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is set global over the Control Center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following codi@@ fication settings can be adjusted to each entry separately . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; over the selection of fields for the coding appears a brief note , which is the local coding . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file code for source files . this influences how special characters treated and interpret . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared with different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have a file edited , you can specify which coding to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing command , they might not be able to function with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files can be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be set with 8 @-@ bit ASC@@ II . ) With this option you can set the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
&quot; turn this off to supp@@ ress the curtains of changes in white characters in the text or review . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options numbers ignore or ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a colour coding column . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files ; s ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal yet another over@@ hau@@ l column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather use for long lines . bl@@ ends just the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
ranks the compar@@ isons with each other or another . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to bring the files together . a simple click starts the con@@ duction and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as pre@@ defined name for the issu@@ ing file . ( if this function is used to run the file , then the name of the last used format will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , they will first commit to this external command . in &amp; Car@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre @-@ processor that meets your own needs . you can use this function for example to cut dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or to correct the inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; in reading a file , they will first commit to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is specified only by the instruction command . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that is exactly your requirements . any input line must have an associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to enable the user to make more flexibility when inser@@ ting the Di@@ ff results . but for this , an external program is needed , and most users would not want to program yourself . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for for@@ len@@ ding command to convert : sed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; . * \ \ 1 in the drawing string refers to the found text in the first cl@@ am@@ mer@@ n@@ few . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the text in Grand case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords used to insert automatically generated text files . * \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ _ _ _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ _ _ _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ _ _ _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ $ / \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \
&quot; whilst you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps like this regular expres@@ sions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
the ign@@ oring of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for for@@ ef@@ . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 89.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every@@ one character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and each hit is replaced by nothing but virtually er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform several compositions up once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the compositions .
instead of sed you can also have something different such as perl use . perl -@@ p -@@ E &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ dings are different with perl some details otherwise . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires perl only ( and ) without the advance &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre @-@ processor will be kept for display and to match . the further operations are changing only the data that the Zei@@ l@@ ab@@ ian @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the Zei@@ l@@ essor is equal to the output of the normal pre @-@ process than input . &quot;
&quot; the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changed or differences , you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers are to edit a folder of many files . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ cur@@ sive and bring together . &quot;
... makes each object to merge a suggestion ; you can adjust the proposal before starting .
... may mer@@ ging the mer@@ ging and shows the simul@@ ated changes without them really perform
... execute selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 button ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) , &quot;
this is the compar@@ isons and run by individual files very similar . you only need to open the folder on the command line or in a dialog file .
&quot; when three folder are assembled , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was used , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as a target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , will not match that . to start together , you must press the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during the reading of the folder you will inform you a small message window about the current progress . if you break the scanning the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then . &quot;
&quot; if the scanning the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and any folder of the file was found during the scan , it is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded . you can double the folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object , or by clicking the arrow buttons on the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions of all sub@@ directories , and all sub@@ directories of which you can use all the folder . &quot;
&quot; if you double click on a file , the file will be started immediately and it will appear a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column reflects the date type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case the inter@@ tw@@ ist action can not be selected automatically . if that run together , you will inform you about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; for identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folder are regarded as identical if your whole content is identical . then , folder are the same color . when folders , the age is in@@ significant for its colour . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this colour scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf@@ let , which is only green , then yellow is and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if you do not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , that cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; a and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , that cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified , and when the option directories are synchroni@@ ze synchroni@@ ze . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
&quot; a and B exist , but not identical are : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file name for the output file only b ; right after the result , copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot;
&quot; if two folder are run together and the option of new file will be activated ( uns@@ afe ) , the date of files and proposes the same date , then the same date appears as error : files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such mistakes can not be eliminated , the folder can &apos;t be started . &quot;
&quot; during the result , a file after the other is processed . it &apos;s status column shows up when the mer@@ ging was successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected came up , you should make a final review and check if the status is everywhere . &quot;
&quot; if in the interior dialog the file method is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 other columns will display . these contain the number un@@ resolved , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dering conflicts is only displayed when three folder are compared or combined . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either run the straight selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries selected once . if you have selected all the inter@@ viewed actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start it together . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have no target folder , then in the three @-@ folder mode , it will be used as the target , in the two @-@ folder , B and / or B will be used as the target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , check out whether all entries are to be displayed in the target folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options to be displayed in the folder structure . check these options to avoid un@@ ad@@ orable surprises : &quot;
&quot; to bring all the entries , select directories show / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cuts ) . to only run the current entry , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if by conf@@ lic@@ ting data types still exist invali@@ d actions , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you perform all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options run , sim@@ ulate and ab@@ rupt . &quot;
select if you only want to see what would happen without the really changes done . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then guides certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( mer@@ ging a single file ) , then a mer@@ ging window will open ( see the screens@@ hot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are ready with a file , select the fil@@ es@@ ystem guide / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog will appear . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next post . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . so you have the opportunity to select a different action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with that . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been compiled individually , you notice a non @-@ diff@@ use ; these entries ( in the current session ) and execute them together in later . even if these entries are not saved . only if you change the mer@@ ging action , these entries will again be mer@@ ged . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set ... ) has now a section called directory meetings with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree . there are several patterns entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; * .@@ h ) . the default file is * . folder do not have to match this pattern .
files and folder that correspond to this pattern will not be displayed in the elementary tree . it can be entered more than a pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ating notes : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default : * .@@ o .
files and folder that correspond to this pattern will not be displayed in the elementary tree . it can be entered more than a pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ating notes : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default : * .@@ o .
ignored files that would be ignored by CV@@ S . many autonomous files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder is specified with a .c@@ v@@ signal file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a verse attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is swit@@ ched to the default . &quot;
&quot; on links to files : if the option is swit@@ ched , symbolic links are compared . if the option is swit@@ ched , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in the default . &quot;
&quot; with links to the folder : if the option is swit@@ ched off , the links like normal folder is treated and recur@@ sively searches . a link to a folder of a link to itself would lead to an end @-@ loop . ) This option is swit@@ ched off . ) This option is swit@@ ched on the default . &quot;
&quot; the complete analysis of each file through and displays the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of sol@@ dered , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and substantially slower when it is applied to files that contain no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare a wide folder on a slow network , it may be faster , only the amendment and the file size does not cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is in the default . &quot;
&quot; similarly as confidential the date of the date . there is no real comparison , when they are the same as they are the same . this can be useful when copying the amendment of the date . please use caution . this option is swit@@ ched to the default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the sync mode when two folder are compared and no target folder . in this mode , the proposals are used to assem@@ ble , so that both files are identical . also the results of the assem@@ bl@@ ings are stored in both folders . this option is swit@@ ched to the default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered uns@@ ure because the other file is not changed too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is swit@@ ched in the default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced by another , then the original version is ren@@ amed and gets the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , this is also associated with normal backup folder . this option also addresses the normal folder . this option is swit@@ ched to the default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder summ@@ ed up in the assem@@ bling of individual files ; you can switch the window folder with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window directory &amp; text window , you can switch the window folder and text window between directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply using double @-@ clicking it . however , you can run a single file directly , without getting the folder , the status will run directly , and the file will not run once again when you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost , however , if you read the directory again : directory menu : new to read &quot;
&quot; KDE supports networking with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 used this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folder for opening , which are on local or remote machines . &quot;
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a com@@ pressed archives with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folder . some things should be observed :
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol protocol . it follows a short list of constraints : &quot;
&quot; or it may not be distinguished whether a link is displayed on a file or folder . then , a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
there is no possibility to process permission or change from the date . therefore , the eligi@@ bility or change date from the original . ( please note the option confidential to the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of the main purpose is currently available as differences @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first ever the built @-@ in @-@ produced differences . to start a diff@@ user , press the right mouse button on the differences between the viewer and then select in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part I display in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; usually , and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a part , takes a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . then , and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . then , and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program &apos;s patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the context of context , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu P@@ review in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ part . please note that this does not work , if any of the original files exists . moreover , this is un@@ reliable if the original files has changed since the generation of the patch . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part run , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . that mer@@ ging or the compar@@ isons of folders , is not supported in the cell mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now Hei@@ st it comp@@ are ) there are already . in addition , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can run together like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff @-@ Tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GPL @-@ programs already very long and have learned a lot by having seen in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or going to go .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script probably not the correct pre@@ fix to KDE . in the pres@@ et installed configure in / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this subject . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters differ depending on the number of white characters , the line will be treated as identical . if the lines appear next to each other , this pl@@ is , but this is the case with the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor will notice every difference in the files where he starts and where it ends . this important information is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and select the button A / B / C . however , this important information is possible if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is a lot of effort to create extra a private file format , which could save this information . &quot;
the effort for this has been too big . you can use a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger amounts of text should be used another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c wins ; appeared and the text does not be clear . what does this mean and how can this be removed ?
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to highlight from differences . even more descent , would be conf@@ using and lacking the purpose . please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and trou@@ bles@@ hooting came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or higher . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ EL@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage .
a list of the latest modifications can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the basics of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; KDE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed . if you are uns@@ afe , find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems at comp@@ iling . should nevertheless difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut ( str@@ g @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt removal ) copies the marked text into the cli@@ p@@ board and delet@@ es the marked text . insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current c@@ urs@@ or@@ position one or replaces the current mark@@ ings .
&quot; only differences : files that are identical in all folders , do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you need to re@@ read changes to these options the folder with the function Re@@ fresh . )
&quot; there are only entries displayed , the differences will be displayed . if the target folder does not already exist in the target folder . if the target folder does not already exist , they are lacking in a later program version . ) This option is de@@ activated in a later program version . ) This option is swit@@ ched to the default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons for the selection of the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you have attached to one of the buttons , the lines are already available from the appropriate window to the end of the selected group in the same window ) . if the lines already exist , they will be removed at the button accordingly . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . Under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ show of all virtual work@@ space . it is quite convenient to see the ongoing programs on the working areas , to change its size , or to postp@@ one it . this works both inside a desktop and several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces , as well as the applications running on running applications . these applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and other work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button will be cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the text @-@ menu has also been cli@@ cked , also appear the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries of the application , maxim@@ ize , on work@@ space and loading . the commands indu@@ ce the following : &quot;
maxim@@ iz@@ es the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when on a application was cli@@ cked .
send the application to select virtual work@@ space . appears only when a application was cli@@ cked .
&quot; it is marked this deck , you can move windows within the repository ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the name of the virtual work@@ space is displayed . &quot;
&quot; depic@@ t of this field lets the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , display the numbers of virtual job surfaces . it is connected together with name , the names containing ordin@@ din@@ als are provided , &amp; eg ; 1 . work surface . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the running programs will be displayed as small windows in the repository . otherwise , otherwise only the empty working areas will be shown to allow their selection . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angle with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and pixel map showing a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , can be known : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n R@@ aster , known as P@@ ager applications in a wa@@ vering set , which is very good for the presentation on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini Programme in the Control bar . he has the advantage that it can display in size , which can display windows as symbols or with their contents , and it also runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right click on the right button of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent equipment set up ... lets the dialog settings appear .
&quot; at the moment , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ an c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you don &apos;t want to login to your system administrator or refer to your system administrator . in this file you have to assign the key win@@ dow@@ ment fashion and to indicate this one value . possible values are :
&quot; da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base , you need a functioning installation of KDE packages . &quot;

&quot; s &amp; km@@ ag ; is an screens ; you can enlarge a magni@@ fier for the small printed or accurate viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a full manual for the use of &amp; km@@ ag . &quot;
&quot; and km@@ ag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly enhanced with new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines . &quot;
&quot; when you start &amp; km@@ ag , a window appears as above . the main window of the screen is displayed . in the following this window shows the enlarged area of the screen , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default adjustment &amp; km@@ ag ; the area around the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor like a movable magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can give a selected screens@@ hot area in the enlargement window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse button at the screens@@ hot ( eg ; on the left side of the edge ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid the mouse @-@ mouse in the enlarged window , select the mouse button . please note that &amp; km@@ ag ; currently not be able to recognise the form of the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor . this is always the standard c@@ ursor ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ Mou@@ se@@ po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your needs . you can move it with the arrow and mo@@ ckers and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse @-@ mouse in the enlargement window and hold the left mouse button de@@ pressed , so you can move the contents of the magni@@ fier and move it . this also goes with the arrow buttons . &quot;
&quot; if you are in addition the &amp; Shift ; taste , or use the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection window . &quot;
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left @-@ left corner of the drop @-@ window remains firm and only the lower right @-@ hand corner move .
&quot; s &amp; km@@ ag ; possesses a lot of functions . you can copy the enlarged image directly to the printer , to add a file to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , the picture is turning and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the update of the display . the load for updating is that the required CPU @-@ time goes against 0 .

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse sho@@ cked a while on the same point . it is meant to help people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive diagram syndrome ) and which each mouse @-@ click pain is prepared . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , once the mouse sho@@ cked a while on the same place . it is meant to help people who em@@ ulate the Rep@@ eti@@ tive strain In@@ verter ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse click pain . besides , it can em@@ ulate the dial using the mouse . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can the pain handle , which is created when clicking the mouse , and helps so many people to use the computer without sor@@ eness . unfortunately , you can also look for pain that are using your computer with the use of your computer . unfortunately , you should look for a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it even more clear : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to be caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain , which is caused by the load of the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result may vary for everyone . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and guides a mouse @-@ click , once you break the movement short . &quot;
&quot; is the intelligent rel@@ ocation , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after having been running the mouse button . now move the mouse , it is waiting until the end of the movement , before the slo@@ ppy disk requires a little practice , but you get used quickly to it . &quot;
&quot; this time period must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a single mouse @-@ click leads . &quot;
&quot; is Intel@@ lig@@ ently swit@@ ched swit@@ ched , the turn@@ around is active ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here the time is set out , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after downloading the mouse is waiting , if there is no mouse button again , if there is no account of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the clicks by mouse deport@@ ation . this function is enabled , creates a slow loading due to the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a long loading go left and back , if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stream / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stream / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stream / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt files will be started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is del@@ ayed , you can shor@@ ten &amp; k@@ de ; to get to shor@@ ten the response time . open to sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the riders . there is a sli@@ der sound bu@@ ffer you set to shor@@ ten you at a lower value to shor@@ ten the answers . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , is run &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available in GNO@@ ME or other window environments , please click the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; put all settings back to the values , which were set when opening the dialog . have you already pushed the kno@@ b , the settings are reset on the status following the last pressures of . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first use the pre @-@ settings . in particular , the intelligent rel@@ oc@@ ating you should first swit@@ ched off . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can later get the intelligent rel@@ oc@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the answers from &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should consciously make yourself aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect remains : the clicking on the neutral elements of windows or in places in the browser window , which does not represent a link , does not go to un@@ arous@@ ed reactions . you can park the mouse in such places where you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse ru@@ ck@@ elt , you should clean@@ se your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse @-@ ball , but also the roles that come with the mouse @-@ ball in touch . &quot;
&quot; first , you must take out the mouse ball . like this happens , from mouse to mouse . it should be clear , however , if you see the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have the ball removed , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the dir@@ t@@ ings can easily be used with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ a waste . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if in this case the intelligent rel@@ ocation , this means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is that the operation can no longer stop by the slogan of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution to this problem consists in that you run a mouse @-@ click . there@@ by , the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset , and you can work as usual . &quot;
problem : if you type text tries to execute &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue mouse clicks and sets the c@@ ursor to another position .
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the c@@ ursor to place where you want to do it . however , you don &apos;t want to lead the mouse on a neutral area of desktop , if you don &apos;t want to gain a touch of mouse . however , the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent rel@@ oc@@ ating , but I do not make it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent rel@@ oc@@ ating is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you handle it . it &apos;s probably possible to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board , paste it into the cli@@ p@@ board and paste it again . however , there will probably only be problems with you . here are some advice for this : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent rel@@ ocation , if you just start using the km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; just highlight text instead as follows : run the Shift key down , while you move the mouse button to move the mouse over the other end of the text and once again fill the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; using the audi@@ ble mouse click . this is the mouse , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the smart slide without the audi@@ ble mouse . but this requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use , the X@@ Test extension must be installed for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most of the system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system features a sound card and l@@ oud@@ speaker and are correctly furnished .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; by the right mouse , as soon as the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor , this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome and which the actu@@ ation of the mo@@ on@@ est pain is prepared . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting that a dial operation begins , before the mouse button is left out . in this way it can also be done with the mouse . &quot;

&amp; km@@ outh ; is a program with the mu@@ te user can speak their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; km@@ outh ; you can mu@@ te users to let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of convers@@ ing to propositions which again should be discussed .
on the first page of the assistant ( lin@@ kes screens@@ hot ) enter the command which will be used later for the language version of text . more details can be found in the description of the furnishings .
&quot; on the second page you select the default textbook . from the text@@ books books you can often choose text@@ books , without them to tap into . the text@@ books may naturally be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screens@@ hot ) you determine the dic@@ tionary for the vocabulary . &amp; km@@ outh ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can read the wording with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dic@@ tionary , so that only correctly sp@@ ed words can be recorded in the vocabulary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; km@@ outh ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the scanning area of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screens@@ hot ) and a reference memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screens@@ hot ) .
&quot; if you have listed km@@ ar , you can enter in the input field , you can enter the sentences that you want to hear . each saved set is attached to the or@@ bit memory . you can choose from it , which should be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu @-@ entry settings high@@ ways ; set up ... open the creation dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; this dialog contains two cardboard cards , language output and settings , the page Wor@@ ship , and the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the cart@@ on map , you give the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , you set the text en@@ coding to be passed on with the text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the cross @-@ field , if the text should be passed on to the language generator as default . &quot;
&quot; if the cross @-@ field is not selected , the text is given as a parameter . you can use the following sets : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command for voice @-@ generator will depend on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the App@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with as a language service , &amp; km@@ outh are used as the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service . if this is successful , the other settings will be further developed on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field , the selection of a text editor will determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cuts or by choosing a text editor in the menu text@@ pass@@ agen@@ book or in the bar for text@@ pass@@ agen@@ ic books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ fort , the chosen text route is directly spoken and additionally inserted in the memory memory . with the selection of In the text@@ field , the chosen text Editor will initially only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ left of the editing window for text pass@@ agen@@ ers , you can specify if the textbook should automatically be saved on the editing pane . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text@@ pass@@ agen@@ buch , the book will be saved . if you need to make modifications , the text password will not be saved . choose to Save your km@@ ar ; ask if the textbook will be saved . &quot;
&quot; the site Wor@@ ds contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the vocabulary . in the main window in addition to the input field shows &amp; km@@ outh ; a selection field , when this list contains more than a dic@@ tionary . with this selection field , you can choose the currently used dic@@ tionary to the vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; with buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books or export them into a file . below the list , you can adjust the name and selection of the language for the dic@@ tionary . &quot;
&quot; select for this source the desired language ; &amp; km@@ outh , then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Docum@@ entation . in addition , you can compare the wording of individual words . in addition , you can compare the wording with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dic@@ tionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dic@@ tionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; km@@ outh , then asks , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are mer@@ ged , and how these wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option you place a new , empty dic@@ tionary without entries . da &amp; km@@ outh ; new given words automatically add into the dic@@ tionary , create a dic@@ tionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
the main area of the window to process Text@@ pass@@ agen@@ books is two divided . in the upper part the text@@ books are shown as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text route , you can change the text@@ books or the related short@@ cuts . if you have chosen a text box , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions like new textbook or books add or select selected text@@ books and books , you can either reach the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a folding menu . &quot;
the order of textbook or text@@ books you can change through the mouse with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button change .
&quot; the chosen text is cut off and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the text@@ field is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the or@@ ship storage . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the text@@ field is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the dec@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is located in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected propositions of the or@@ bit . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is crossed , is displayed an shifting tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the tail@@ ed left side and dial , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is crossed , becomes a narrow cor@@ ste at the bottom part of the main window with hints on the state of &amp; km@@ outh ; displayed when not sho@@ cked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is crossed , will be displayed a tr@@ end@@ able cor@@ ste for text@@ pass@@ agen@@ ic books with entries . the bar is displayed directly under the tool@@ bar window . by mouse click on the tail@@ ed left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; probably , you do not have the command of the language output correctly or not completely entered . open settings to the page of the page , open the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the cardboard map language . ( see Sub@@ scription dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer to further details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a language edition of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ ch are supported . the license allows for free to use Festival free of charge and re@@ distribute no restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to the language version is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a in &amp; Java ; he only supports English language . currently he only supports the English language . the license allows it to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ eware . the language version is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be swit@@ ched as standard application . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ ony into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to cr@@ ush the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la are installed . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax would like to send the final signs of the text , so that an additional character must be added . the complete command is therefore more costly than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo &quot; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ F _ BAR _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / f@@ 1 / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option data must be swit@@ ched as default .
the voice @-@ com@@ pe@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ next language service that is available to all &amp; k@@ de ; applications will be further developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different language output systems .
&quot; since the adjustment of the language generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service as a language service to be used in &amp; km@@ outh . &quot;
&quot; to setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service , which appears in the creation dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; appears if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ outh ; successful to use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; km@@ outh ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for voice generator ) , but it depends in the individual of your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; km@@ ar ; is an application that can not speak with the people who can not speak to give text by the computer . it is already saved a list already sear@@ ched sentences , which the users can always leave again and again . &quot;
note that &amp; km@@ outh ; no language syn@@ thesizer includes . on the machine a language syn@@ thesi@@ zers must be installed .

&quot; marriage You &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , you must install the Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher and set it correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; when the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speaker are set up , the cart@@ ei@@ card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the cart@@ on map will be shown . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or such a combination of language , syn@@ thesizer , voice , sex , volume and speed is defined as a speaker before you write &amp; kt@@ ts , as the program speed disp@@ ense otherwise used the standard speaker . &quot;
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printers in the same printers .
&quot; if you click on the cart@@ on speakers in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the cart@@ ei@@ card speaker is displayed . this also appears automatically when you start t@@ opping and not yet another speaker . &quot;
all already decorated speakers appear in this list . the pre@@ valent speaker appear above on the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
&quot; select a click on a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speakers from the list . &quot;
&quot; select a click on a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with one mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines its priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; product system .
&quot; choose a voting type here , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a junk@@ er and girl voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; click here , will appear on the new spokes@@ person on the cardboard card speaker . to change the settings of this intercom , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; for almost use . go back to the box map and check whether language edition activate ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS @-@ Service of &amp; k@@ de ; Start . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; please click on the cardboard card orders to create text orders . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can launch the language system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the cardboard box to open this cardboard card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; highlight this deck field to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; it starts the KDE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this start is successful , the cardboard card orders will be displayed and you can read text orders and read the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , provided the field of language ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed . &quot;
&quot; is this deck marked and t@@ kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears in the pre @-@ read automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the pre @-@ read is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can launch text orders , stop and resume . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch to the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click on apply or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the cardboard card orders is only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the cardboard General and activ@@ ating there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can check the text of the posted website . check out the text that is supposed to be read , and select in the main menu tools text . after a short time the language version should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ head@@ lines and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can pre @-@ read text posted . check out the text that is supposed to be read , and select in the main menu tools text . then the language output should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works , if &amp; Kate ; in other applications is embedded , as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which you can notify about you by you . you can also read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts ; &quot;
&quot; in conversation , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; for example , you can notify different types of messages , for example , you can notify me when in an IR@@ C channel you can notify me when in a IR@@ C channel , you can then read the IR@@ C notification text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu item noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . here are the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; filter for the drawing box provide a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . you removed the tags br and b from the news , the K@@ Mail sends , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , since this can be assumed in most cases than provided . read also . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text will be processed , before it is sent to the Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . you are useful to improve the pron@@ unci@@ ations or abbrevi@@ ations to select a proper language and speaker or to handle certain shortcomings of voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four kinds of text . &quot;
&quot; the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it is moved to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of Screen Reader is pre @-@ read , the previous orders will be continued . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the issue of news and normal text . these orders are repeated after the issue of warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example for application that lets you read messages . during you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can greet someone who just follow the room . &amp; k@@ de ; al@@ erts are also news . read about this .
&quot; the rest are simple text entries . each order that you encounter from the cardboard card orders , is a text contract . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that have text entries . text entries are meant for the issue of longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queue , except the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application is sent the output of a screen reaction , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this edition will be stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first , you must know that filters never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text entries as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News . &quot;
&quot; filter with text and enter it on the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters . &quot;
filters are running as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .

&quot; with speaker kits , you can purchase orders depending on the content of the text or subject to the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set the text on a female voice , you can read text by KDE news about it . read above . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which he is applied to a language version . if the filter is proof that its rules does not exist , it gives the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text yield , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; al@@ erts on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent it by all activated filters , which will be set down on the page below . the processing by the filter is carried out in the order from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed in line from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be shown below the following furnishings . &quot;
&quot; for the establishment of string qu@@ ettes type , you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as compar@@ ative method . these patterns will be found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding spare parts . large and small @-@ term will not be observed when compared . &quot;
&quot; type your filter a name . you can choose any name , it must be different from the name of the other filters . &quot;
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column , and replaces it in accordance with the string . the list is shown in the indicated order from above down . &quot;
click here to postp@@ one the marked word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file to save the current list or delete it . download a list from a file , the entries will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language entered , the filter is used only if the speaker for the text entry is one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you click on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is used only when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by coma mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
the applic@@ ations@@ ID flow programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers must leave you away . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 is allowed to enter only copies .
&quot; the strings filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box di@@ et@@ filter if match . are all input fields blank , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when compared to words , the character filter filter uses regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ating signs ( space ) both sides . &quot;
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular expression / # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ce .

&quot; with the inter@@ viewer filter , you can send texts to a certain speaker , which is set up on the cardboard map , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can set for example to be read text by k@@ mail from a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter passes , there is a speaker for the text . the spokes@@ person is selected based on the spokes@@ person , which provides the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the properties of the speakers provided on the cardboard card speaker . with the intercom filter , you can write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is used when the text is applied to the given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions , you can call this with a click on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; Set here the properties of the requested speaker . if the text included the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected to show the desired requirements . click on the button to view the dialog speaker selection . &quot;

none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesi@@ zers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have installed the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ De@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for the festival websites will not be read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , so that SA@@ B@@ LE does not work at all . you &apos;ll also need to do this voice to the pre @-@ reading web pages . also , you must also do that program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and on the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation seem to cause errors in syn@@ thesizer , so that whole propositions is printed or only Kau@@ der@@ mer@@ sch is spent . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the option is set on the right value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be fixed by a string filter filter . see . &quot;

K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; con@@ sole ;
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or obsolete . therefore , you can therefore consider the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; for information , which are not yet included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses a customiz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for use of another syn@@ thesi@@ zers , please contact the developer team . &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for support SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; converting filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile &amp; compile , you need a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the discharge files for the program &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from source texts for k@@ de@@ ability , or downloaded the ball up at a date and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check whether Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher works with your language syn@@ thesizer correctly . for this purpose , you can use the Shell@@ .@@ SPD conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that is the program Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g is to be developed so further that the establishment of Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher is not possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is broken into single phrases . the user may withdraw or withdraw , repeat the output or break off . &quot;
&quot; if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can indicate the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . so if you have set a speaker , whose language English and his sex is female , this is otherwise the best suitable speaker chosen , otherwise , if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker chosen , see you in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the box map to add a speaker to the list or click on editing , the cardboard card set @-@ up will be shown . as an example , the establishment of the module for Festival Interactive is shown . details about the modules can be found here . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is included at the festival in P@@ AT@@ H , you only need to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; choose the strings for text , which is handed over to the festival . with voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is automatically made . generally applicable , that Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , for@@ est@@ able languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , make volume , Interphone speed and sound of the synthetic language . if you cannot choose some regul@@ ator and that gray will be displayed , the voice may not be chosen by you . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require , due to their size several seconds to be loaded , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with maximum memory consumption ) the first sentence is syn@@ thesi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; if this starter box can not be selected , you have not yet set up any speaker ( or forget to apply to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; is this cross @-@ line marks , is displayed at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section . otherwise , after starting only the icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this connection is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not yet released , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD will pre @-@ read a text . therefore , you have the possibility to read or to control the pre@@ text . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the straight mach@@ ined set . the speaker id corresponds to the column ID on the cardboard card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can be selected in the order that is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK all changes of the settings ( also available on the other cart@@ on cards ) , and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr becomes a symbol in the system section . click on this symbol to display the program window again . &quot;
&quot; if the Sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the cardboard card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here only text entries are listed and managed . issues of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . more information about the types of &amp; kt@@ ts , can be found in . &quot;
&quot; here , select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , was compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audi@@ om@@ o@@ dul or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no starting @-@ smo@@ ker can be displayed in the list , you have to select at least one module , select the PC@@ M device here . see also &quot;
&quot; ask the intercom speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % is roughly the half and 200@@ ,00 ; % roughly the double normal phone speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
apply to the new settings for the current &amp; product system .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices contains all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , select standard . &quot;
&quot; on this box card , you can set specific actions that will always be executed when the text entry is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language skills : &quot;
&quot; the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it is moved to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the Screen reader , the previous orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot reserved . a warning holds the issue of news and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application to read the news . if you want to read a long text on a website you can see with &amp; km@@ outh ; nevertheless someone welcome someone who is straight to the room .
&quot; if a text yield is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audi@@ os into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be used when a normal text order is interrupted . if both in@@ conduc@@ tive , sound and introductory message is active , the introductory sound is used in front of the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this box card apply only for normal text entries . for messages , war@@ nings , and the issues of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern there are no special promotions if this is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages read , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the cardboard card notices appears . &quot;
&quot; highlight this deck field to switch the pre @-@ reading of &amp; k@@ de ; this setting is not marked , the other settings are disabled and dis@@ kt@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this setting marks is marked , noti@@ fications when a sound is played , from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;

&quot; Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a language version . this standard contains brands for the control of voices , the volume speed , the volume , the voice and sound level . furthermore , trademarks for the control of the pron@@ unci@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard . &quot;
currently &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are present :
&quot; you have to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , since this is the default voice that is used at the SS@@ ML edition . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or key in the festival configuration dialog is not on 100@@ th ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and stat@@ ute filter Fil@@ ters ( SD@@ B filter ) . thus , the first phrase must be syn@@ thesi@@ zed , because only the first proposition must be syn@@ thesi@@ zed , because only the first proposition is syn@@ thesi@@ zed , because only the first proposition is syn@@ thesi@@ zed , not the whole text order , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the stat@@ ute filter filter . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , is automatically set up as a stat@@ ute filter filter automatically . you can change its settings or add other stat@@ ute filter filter , it will be cancelled . &quot;
&quot; easiest to learn the establishment of the speaking selection by out . place the speaking selection of speakers and enter text for reading , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changing . of course you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ ts ; then faster with the pre @-@ reading can begin , because only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; if you can keep text orders on the cart@@ on map or break down , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons the normal stat@@ ute filter is automatically set up , if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g for the first time . it cannot be removed , just removed . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
&quot; stat@@ utes off@@ springs compare text with a regular expression for stat@@ utes and add a tabby code ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the stat@@ utes , ( tab are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter is attached . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD @-@ filters will never be used on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( col@@ der ) , war@@ nings , messages or output from screen @-@ reaction . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal stat@@ ute filter filter , you can insert it again by using the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; on the cardboard card speaker , you can write the intercom settings for application . the box card is displayed if &quot;
use of the default speakers ( the top on the cardboard card speaker ) . in other words : there are no inter@@ viewer properties .
&quot; using the most suitable speaker , which shows all the features of an equipped speaker . if you don &apos;t delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker is made . otherwise chosen &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , the most presented to the original features . &quot;
&quot; select the method for entering the desired speakers , by clicking on one of the selection buttons . &quot;
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not matter , you do not give anything . &quot;
&quot; highlight this deck field , if the property should have priority in front of other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ings here . &quot;
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when understanding the issue is , this is always treated as a priority feature . you may specify this property rarely . the only case in which you possibly want to specify the attribute language if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than that in the work environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the area speakers , the most listed below is to delete , click on the selection button standard speakers , and then use on speakers that corresponds to the following below . &quot;
&quot; in this case 0 for the final text entry in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; t@@ kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr cr@@ ashes immediately when it comes started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I do not come back . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is pl@@ ung@@ ed and fir@@ med ; probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer are installed . you can attempt g@@ stre@@ amer to update or un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; the audi@@ o@@ edition of AL@@ SA does not work when I am playing music simultaneously with another application , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; con@@ sole , appears a message that has been said : &quot; &quot; to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is to prevent conflicts with AL@@ SA , which can prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use them in Festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr shows this voice .
&quot; add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festival@@ int / making the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; when you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the cardboard card audio there is a setting speed . thus this works , the program must be so@@ x installed and over the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ zer@@ mod@@ ul@@ s like Festival Interactive offer itself on the cardboard card for speed . depending on the chosen voice this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the Interphone speed will be ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( see it , using the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are completely brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t make it read that web pages are subject to a female voice . I have set a female Festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SA@@ B@@ LE GEN@@ DER does not appear to work . so the festival does not produce errors , the X@@ SL file to converting SS@@ ML to S@@ but the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a new text @-@ like filter filter and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ ts ; not more sales , or go back . on the cardboard orders is displayed , the order is just out of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; feature marks ( point , fr@@ age@@ marks , comm@@ anding , comm@@ anding and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you are not allowed to filter . use a filter for this sign instead of a filter detection . &quot;

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows the management of network interfaces , routine and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a range of system and desktop settings on a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; called .. &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ Package has been developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks : &quot;
after the installation a new module &apos;s settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the module &apos;s settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is in@@ compatible and the setting of the network features . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed in the installation of &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . will be added to network devices later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the core version . &quot;
&quot; the module settings will be loaded if the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index selected is selected . when star@@ ters of the Modul@@ s Network Settings is trying to detect this , the platform used by the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the top choice is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and the release . by selecting the setting non @-@ again requests , this selection will automatically set automatically . &quot;
&quot; the changing network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . before , all options are gray , which means the settings can only be considered , the Change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you will be able to use the button mode at the right bottom of the module . it is the entry of the password required . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders : &quot;
the rider network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces can be performed as follows :
&quot; the settings are set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button , set up ... in a dialog device . &quot;
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click of the button Exten@@ ded settings reveals the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of Autom@@ atic , the TCP / IP settings are picked up by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are required for the system at the same time with the start of system services . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server will be required for the system . in the selection list can be selected either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , selected . &quot;
&quot; with the selection manu@@ ell can be made without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP address . in the text@@ field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; this setting marks , initi@@ alizes the system of network interface at boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values given in this dialog will be shown as properties of the device in the device .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; con@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or activated depending on demand or dis@@ able by selecting from the list and click on the interface .
network devices can be activated or off on demand . off on an activated network system by selecting from the list and click on the interface ....
&quot; the IP address of the machines in the local sub@@ network establishes the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default , TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ marine assets . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is available more than a network interface , the interface needs to be selected in which the gateway computer is to be selected . &quot;
a computer with DNS support replaces a full cathedral @-@ address replaced by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer is called http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org you solve the DNS name in a IP address as approximately 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
&quot; the calcul@@ ator to the requested solution part of the Reit@@ ner &apos;s name allows an easy handling of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified it by selecting a entries and execution or her@@ edit@@ ary in the list with the buttons , or Her@@ below in the priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button ... from the group calcul@@ ator , a DNS server can be added to a DNS server . it is displayed in the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to enter the IP @-@ address of the DNS server and then add the button to button . the entry will be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator , select an entry and then click on the button Edit .... It will be shown the dialog editing . &quot;
&quot; the list of known calcul@@ ator describes the calcul@@ ator name for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily on boats if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains particularly well @-@ known calcul@@ ators , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this is still in the test well @-@ being version of IP is to be replaced in future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add ... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known machines and enter the button Add . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , de Kno@@ pf Add several times and enter the further aliens . &quot;
choose an entry of a particular known machines from the list and choose editing .... The dialog of acquain@@ ting machines will be shown .
&quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then click OK the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , it must be set in a &amp; con@@ sole ; the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net to download the latest version of the source .
&quot; for installing the binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed . &quot;
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply the rpm package to download and in a &amp; con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graf@@ ic surface like k@@ package or the installation tool for their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages are required with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile . the following commands should make this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology are given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files . &quot;
this section can not replace any knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is convey@@ ed .
&quot; currently IP networks with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 5 ) has never found great spread . from IP@@ v@@ 6 , this description is focused on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to assign . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the response administrator who is used to be a valid IP address . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen simply as arbitr@@ ary ! &quot;
&quot; when entering your own small ( home ) network should be chosen the IP address , specially designed for this purpose to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the internet , therefore their usage is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks are usually used addresses in the area of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large for networks up to 250 computers big enough .
&quot; in addition , the mains mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all computers participants are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the Zw@@ inger @-@ back @-@ address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the standard route is needed for IP @-@ re@@ direc@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP @-@ traffic in the local own machine . usually , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this part , the configuration files are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes changed at DSL connections , so that it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections to find another content than defined there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; S@@ USE ; is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config , another stand than expected can occur . &quot;

&quot; cr@@ on , for example vi@@ xie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command cr@@ ont@@ ab to change the sched@@ ules of the user . &quot;
a PO@@ SIX @-@ compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for band@@ run works on the basis of tar . it offers the ability to create several archives on a tape , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective exter@@ mination . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife presented : how much longer does it take ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen on three types : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ ult the band back and reads the pre @-@ voltage information of the belt . det@@ ects , the sp@@ ear on the tape will not , you will be asked if the band is form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; acknowled@@ gement ; the prec@@ ursor , is looking for the right index on your record . can not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index is to be created . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol is changing for the band@@ age , to indicate that the band is integrated . in the status bar there is a corresponding message . the content of the belt can now be sear@@ ched through the contract of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the ban@@ ker , first of all , the integration must be resolved . there are three methods to achieve this . &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; gives a change to the symbol for the tape that the inclusion for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be raised without any danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ at@@ ted .
&quot; a band @-@ types must be form@@ at@@ ted before you have to save data . this procedure does not need to be form@@ at@@ ted before using the tape , it must be form@@ at@@ ted before using the band of &amp; k@@ dat files . flo@@ ppy belt plants usually do not use a form@@ atting of the Ban@@ des ahead , DAT drives . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and the capacity is named &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the belt , all the data on the tape will be lost automatically ! after completion of the form@@ atting , the band will be automatically integrated and can be used . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you must select the safest files . this can happen on three ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in the local file tree , only this file or the folder is secured . &quot;
highlight a backup profile in the tree . only the files given in the profile specified .
highlight files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
right click on the local file tree and choose in the menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been introduced , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files and change the settings for securing the backup . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will be secure . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
highlight a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or folder .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu check ....
&quot; once the test process was started , the dialog settings for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the work folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will be re@@ viewing . this dialog shows the progress of the testing process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can restore the re @-@ establish , the files that should be recovered , marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives , which include an entry for the band@@ age . it is restored only to select the selected file or sub@@ folder . &quot;
highlight the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . it is restored only the files and / or sub@@ folder .
click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu retri@@ eve ....
&quot; once the recovery process started , the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialogue you can check your selection and change the work folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialogue will be re @-@ establish . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the Band@@ index@@ file by using the band &apos;s contents . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
&quot; this gives a backup profile , with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
&quot; the current work@@ station , where the backup should be performed . the list of insured files will be automatically updated according to the chosen work@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; for all the folder , which are listed under the backup files , that only the files are stored in the same file system , as the folder . folder , which are on other file systems , you can enter separately under backup files . each entry is independently considered independent of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last in@@ creative backup , a snap@@ shot file will be saved . only the files secured since then changed . &quot;
&quot; the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the final incre@@ mental backup . &quot;
delet@@ es the snap@@ shot file before the call of tar . this causes all files secured and create a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
you can set the settings on the menu item PC@@ at ... in the menu settings . the following settings can be found :
the full path to the device for the belt work ( usually / dev / t@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ der variant of the band@@ unit .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated with the command load to the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reader or write operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is swit@@ ched , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the throw at the band@@ age group . possibly this setting does not work in all band@@ width . &quot;
&quot; if the option is swit@@ ched on , with the dis@@ solve the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically use the band . use this option not with Flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; is the option swit@@ ched to change &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ ty block size for the band@@ age . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you have to communicate &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band@@ width is shared . &quot;
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted it writes a file at the beginning of the ban@@ ker . this file should only occupy one storage block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
&quot; ( N Byte ) The tape @-@ ID . the format of this string is invo@@ icing name : seconds , using the name of the full name of the system , on which the tape has been form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has been form@@ at@@ ted since the time . &quot;
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat files .

&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewers for system prot@@ ok@@ olle . the program is suitable for unwanted users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files . additionally it allows for quick access to the example of information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of the own system . the program is suitable for un@@ ri@@ dden users who cannot know where you can get information about your system or where the system depos@@ ited the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users access fast access to information about problems which occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced functions , with which help the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful features . this includes :
support for many different types of log files for the format of sy@@ slo@@ g servers and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screens@@ hot , presents &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available with which help the individual protocol lines are easily fil@@ tered and sort . the individual opportunities for sor@@ ting and filter@@ ing are shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book . &quot;
&quot; after starting to start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol . will not display it , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have been running under Linux folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no justi@@ fication for reading . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter for a chosen crit@@ erion or after given character labels . the list of the log lines will now automatically be displayed , so that only log @-@ line will be displayed in the default setting . then a protocol line contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search engines will be included . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a different entry in this place . select the string of the filter concept , then select the column procedure , and enter the name of a process , so shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines are sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to identify the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level errors are displayed with a con@@ spic@@ uous color as protocol lines of the level note . the colored display of protocol lines can be swit@@ ched off .
&quot; if you only want to show a specific process ( for example in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filter@@ ing bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window , to display all new added protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub@@ window and to control . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol on display . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ are@@ .@@ org. D@@ ort find out more about the sources of sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following also named ) as a k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for the control of the program for the high @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux world . therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I do not know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . it is therefore important because anyone could try to make a machine based on System V In@@ it , without a new installation and re @-@ format . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ ite is also different from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is named r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort , you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folder : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service that you want to boot up to another Run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such matters such as set@@ boards , which are only once started . such views include r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be in part with / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems possess this file , even if it does not have much use for this . you can also make a r@@ c.@@ level in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to carry something to do with the seri@@ ousness . &quot;
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first that he finds .
the standard Run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the specified Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can change your etc / in@@ itt@@ ab from hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you are able to rest@@ art the system by re@@ boot the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you want -@@ l enter in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written , that it &apos;s an argument as start and stop . you can actually launch this script from hand on the command line below : &quot;
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one K includes , the script will be called with the argument . if it includes a S , the script will be called with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way of set machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; win ; a server @-@ run@@ level , which can run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . moreover , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level ; , network &amp; etc ; start . &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was used as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another po@@ inter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start him on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can move scripts between Run@@ lev@@ les or change the position within a level by moving elsewhere . this only does not happen if they draw an entry from the range of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved , if you select this in a new area . to select it only to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select copying from the menu editing or from the context menu - even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of a entry may sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again , add the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently there is no possibility to restore entries , which were thrown into the tr@@ ash . be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable the different work@@ places ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the c@@ ursor buttons to meet a selection of top or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another Run@@ level , move it with Aus@@ cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of a entry manually , press the entry button to open the properties dialog . use the tab@@ ulator button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to make the changes , or press es@@ c to throw the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data transfer , all entries in the menu file require confirmation , before they are executed . &quot;
&quot; all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . if settings are available from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise , they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise , changes to preferences will be stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . &quot;
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ les and now the machine starts up @-@ resistant . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard Run@@ level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be ok ) .
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
if you use &amp; S@@ USE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) then you have to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of distribution .
&quot; the type , as system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution : please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply end up without a message when their configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this hand@@ book can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you made modifications , you need to save it . either use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or entry stor@@ ing in the menu file . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two cardboard cards , user interface and user list . for editing , select the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ clicking on the entry . it appears the dialog user interface or group features . &quot;
&quot; some cart@@ on cards are only represented if you have extended system settings . only if you have limited space settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a cardboard card will be made available if shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xen are installed . &quot;
&quot; the cart@@ on map will be released , in case shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xen are installed . &quot;
this box card appears only if for at least a built @-@ in file storage system ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognis@@ able at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can modify parameters for each user while the limited restrictions are in KB :
these parameters can be adjusted for each file system individually . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system .
&quot; the cardboard card groups inform@@ s about the group members of the selected user . the default group , which the user belongs , you will find in the field Prim@@ ary group . furthermore , the user can highlight in other groups by highlight them in the great field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog properties of the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select from the menu user or group or click on the appropriate added button of the tool@@ bar . the editing or delet@@ ing of the selected user or the selected group works an@@ alogue . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , adding the boot menu , remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove the operating systems , remove and change more . &quot;
