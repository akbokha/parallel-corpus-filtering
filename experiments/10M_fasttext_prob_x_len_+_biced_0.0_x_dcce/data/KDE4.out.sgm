<seg id="304">This setting will only be supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that submerged pictures in four steps will get more details in the nickname. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">"the standard is it the top-up, so the parts of your images are burned down, due to the incapacity to catch the top of your camera. finally, the setting colors will create some unusual results, as they create the shreporters in various rosatches. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the nickname."</seg>
<seg id="306">"this is possible because blue pixels in general does not come as fast as green and red." and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the lack of green and red compartments from the yet not saturated blue pixel. of course, this is a question how much colour or white you want. "</seg>
<seg id="307">"if you select the option reconstructed, you get the possibility to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each picture individually."</seg>

<seg id="317">"the input profiles should fit to the camera producer and model that you use. not all profiles are included in the same way. currently, there are some, like Canon, which do not have any color-tone or gammakesy. currently, dw Gamma is not for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means you have to perform the color mapping yourself."</seg>
<seg id="318">"there are other options like the soft-proof profile, with which you can emulate how your printer can be returned from one device. this is very useful when you print a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated. this could manually correct, rather than to leave on the blind algorithm of your printer."</seg>
<seg id="319">"for most cameras, it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided with them for what is intended. unfortunately, there is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficially:"</seg>

<seg id="362">The sampling tree is dynamically adapted to the given search engines. you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly. this ability is especially useful when you have many keyword.</seg>
<seg id="363">"the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering the keyword in a picture series. if you have entered various keywords, these are stored for fast access."</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by markings of the corresponding attachment fields in the tree. all of the tags of an image are stored into the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">"selecting multiple images in the main view, and select a keyword in the keynote tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, please refer to the keyword filter section."</seg>
<seg id="366">"the sidebar sampling filter is used to change the selection of the displayed images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar with their album, - filum, sampling and search engines is used, only the intersections of this two are displayed. all listed keywords are available."</seg>

<seg id="368">"in the upper example, the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day. the sampling filter is reduced to one keyword. you have been selected with Strg + a, and afterwards a keyword was drawn from the right sampling tree on the selection and stored there. a dialog will be asked if this keyword should be set."</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched under settings.</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try a further manual processing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, paragraphs Absame and contrast, from the menu Korrigid Automatic correction are automatically trying to make your colors the best. you will need to experiment with these effects, to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">"normalize: this method scalable the luminescent point of black and the brightest point as bright as possible, without its colour shaded. this function is often a magnetic correction for images the dark or adult."</seg>
<seg id="391">"unequal: this method jusfies the illuminator of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the Intention is as flat as possible. sometimes, the very good results achieved in the improvement of the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces trash. it is a very powerful surgery which can either be caused by a picture or destroyed it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic shutters: this method maximises the color range in the red, green and blue canal. you will find the dark and bright border-tones and juszed the red, green- and blue-channels on the entire histograms area."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast to contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of an image through the move of the lowest and highest value on the greatest possible range and a new generation of all values in between. this is only visible in full images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">"the white-straight away from & digitization; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white-straight photos."</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white-straight-correction is slightly limited because over a color foam with 8-bit per colour. if you can go far from the original picture, which works in the blank mode, which in 16-bit mode works, so your ways are to be better off."</seg>
<seg id="396">"this tool is based on a white balance sheet of the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you start it over the menu item, white white items identical to the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="397">"the anteroom can be adjusted to the size. on the left, both the original picture and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white straight away, then it is enough to click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the audience has a red marker. the Luminance of the Pixels under this marker is shown as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"right up there will be an histogram shown that dynamic as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful there, even in well illuminated pictures, most pixels very small lumbar levels. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminous."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow of the shadow lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even down."</seg>
<seg id="401">"as a stat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature Pipette. press this button and then somewhere to the picture view on the calculation of color temperature of the white balance. this type of color will also set the temperature and green values automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white comparison with the list of settings. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The oversealing indicators increases the colors when more than a colour channel of the pixel is overexposed.. you will be shown the combined result in the white version. this is shown in the preview as ran indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons save as and store just this. each setting of the white balance you set may have to save you in a text file and later load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the knob preferences set all the filter values again on their default values and the associated white white balance. please note that, neutral settings are a different photo as your original. if you save it, your original picture will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set here the codiles per colour channel of the machined image. 8-bit coding is better suited for high quality pictures. this coding requires also more record, processing time and stands for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">"this tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw materials. it uses the change and assignment of colour profiltration. color mapping can be performed by the signatures for the use of colour profiling, you can rate the chapter color administration."</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to be found in the menu under colours audio-correction. this tool provides an integrated way to use multiple colour channels at the same time. this is helpful when your camera or scanner always need the same error and therefore you always need the same correction. in the manual for audio-correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful opportunity to correct problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digitization came; tool Farbeffeffects introduces you four color effects, a solar energy effect, a bicycle filter effect, a neon effect and a canteen filter available."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, solar isation was also called Sabatier, an effect of the painting. the colored areas sheltered out of the additional light. this had the effect that the lightening areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second light. this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar isation. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what chemical is possible. another increase will eventually create a negative picture that is not to be found on photopapier."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar energy efficiency. the original picture is the (1) and the processes (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the vivid filters simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; -effect. it differs from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrast, that he makes a stronger contrasteffect that makes the colors brilliant and smoothing. try it simply, it embellished a lot of photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for one on daylight, the name is created by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated colors are also a few photographs, especially those that hardly marvelous landscapes, too much."</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter sizing neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide reps the strength of the neonlichts. at large pictures the filter may expose the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the color contrasts and to correct the luminosity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all of your judicial options can be seen in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you are used.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you can get a photo with bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a good choice to reduce the saturation instead of increasing them. all changes you can perform in the preview. if Him would like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool Gradation and the simple luminosity / contrast / gamma is the tool of key correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated, you need only the area of slider to explain just the area of slider. concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graphing of the intensity values, an histogram, the active channel, or the selected area. under the graphs are three sliders into the clicked and the move can change to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digitization came; three different tools available to the harps. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for harps. it is very fast and simple, but, especially in dark areas, gracious images."</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpened mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture tougher. in fact it is not a bit like it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and he is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Reaction is possibly the best of the three because he really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without a focus as well as most digitised images need to put together a correction of the sharpness. this, in turn, causes a little vulnerable to a colour point. the same phenomenon can be observed if colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more subsequent scoring as normal cameras for the private user."</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG images, often a camera internal scure has been applied. images in the resource format, must always be used in processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner turn a scarf already during the reading of the image. if you deactivate this, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain additional results by sharpening a photo with the sharpens procedure. this allows you to call the menu of the menu.</seg>
<seg id="487">"but you should hereby handle cautious, since the results are not very natural: the harness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplify the noise. in general, the appropriate technology is to refocus on the tool. you can also find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpens."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: one image is too cracking. the solution, the image is a little soft to draw, is much easier than it to shark. use the tool for softmarks with the menu supplement corrigid soft, and experimenting with settings. the showcase on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is blurred masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help edit the image. the showcase of the filter shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should first check out the effect. if you make the insharpness mask too strong, craving and the impression of grats will produce close to sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents a how many pixels on each page are affected by the filters. high-res images allow greater radii. they should therefore raise pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the original image is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the Corpora is a break from the maximum RGB value and to use the difference. you can thus use a minimum difference thus for a channel of filter is applied. in this way, areas will be avoided with a soft change between the tones of sharpness and therefore beauty faults in faces, celesticks and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp filter filters. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a corpora = 0.0. "</seg>
<seg id="496">"the & digitization came; tool refocused on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyprotected unfaltation filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe."</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool is trying to use a picture & quot; refocussed on. this is better approach than trying to raise the photo. it is using a technique called FIR Wiener Filters. use the traditional technique for the sharpness of images is the use of an unsharpened mask. they can run it out of the menu by using colors Refocussing in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular catch is much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung is a very long tail, which goes far from the original pixel size. the FIR Wiener inverse of the Gauß'schen Faltung is even influenced by the distant pixel. this causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular loop: this is the radius of circular flow. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures, it is possible to put a higher value if your image is very blurred if your image should be very blurred however."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: a increase in the correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharply effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"Rauschfilter: an increase in the smokfilter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 is very helpful. however, values higher than 0.1 is very bad. a reasonable value is 0.03. a high value will still be merged."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß'sche Schärfe: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche Schärfe. in most cases, you should use this value to zero to annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, so you may also have to increase the correlation and / oderden smokfilter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"total size: this value determines the size of the transformational size. however, a increase in mattress size can produce good results, especially if you choose great values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß'schen archipelago. however, note that the module is very slow if you choose great values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refocussing parameters that you set will have set it later and can then be loaded for later.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before you use the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much surgeries changes that are not immediately visible, but later left inconvenient artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you are reading pictures and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally produces blurred masking better results as a scarce. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood as sharpens.</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, it needs to be blurred masking and generate artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of insharpness. for the Vienna Filter one can never show the effect of the FIR filter. practically, the FIR filter filter is often better in processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between different filters, in a small unfocused picture, see:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture must be corrected. this picture was done with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light to the auto-focus lens.</seg>

<seg id="519">"detailing p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to a uniform glass smoothing about the image. however, a value of 0,9 should receive details so that no sharpness should be necessary. note, please note that the detailing always should be ordered."</seg>
<seg id="520">"judging Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a filgritt or CCD Rauschen will produce a high value-similar patterns. JPEG artefacts are best placed at a value close to 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothing [0, 500]: this puts the maximum smoothing factor over all. p then defines the relative smoothing. put this value to the degree of smoking in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this figure is necessary, as it is difficult if you want to generate a lot of noise, as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turmoil effect, it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetition: returns to how often the algorithm is going through. normally here 1 or 2.</seg>

<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size of 1 (3x3) to 20 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the amount of filter per pixel and can disagree the image via the image and the colour in it and thus fixes the smaller mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the pixelude to determine the filter downside. if it will be increased, smokpointed switch off. you may need to change the edges filter. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details does not get more and smoother or lubricate again."</seg>

<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the colour values exceeds the pre-level threshold, the pixels will be followed in 4 subpixel, which can be checked individually and can be checked on further subdivision. the maximum depth of records can be checked by lowering."</seg>

<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters for the audio-quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereotypes with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereotypes with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256" = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titels. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereotypes with high quality. "</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a titels. good enjoyment for music of young people, portable devices and Autostereoscillators. but not good enough for better HiFi stereotypes."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this attitude."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that is run manually or by the program automatically fetched from the freeDB via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be handed over / used with & kaudiocreator; and the codile program to generate the folder and the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with codierprograms, there is often a combination of program provisions for the Kodierer and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the Kodierers declare the switch for these programmes."</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: day) add the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & Caudiocreator; parameters which can be used (= button-drawing in assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which persons can download the audio CDs, so that all other information can be downloaded by yourself in the computer. it is to note that here only by text is spoken by yourself: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (arrim of the ureacers: this is the author meant) am not attorney. however, no one can prevent the information on the & CD; for more or less valuable, so either the artist can damage nor the music company. all information can be obtained from a stroll through a & CD; business, physically or virtual."</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & audiocreator; is active a cross-section (Sitting a address). for the use of freeDB can be used with another (counterfated) address as the data in the system. this type of configuration is not used (This may only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">"in many countries there are copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; for the use of freeDB, the geographic server will be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and compares the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to Freedb.org provides a current list of mirrors for the online call of & CD; information during the read of a & CD; alternatively you can download the complete database or (usually monthly) only the updates to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which readable program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see for sure that the cdparanoia package has to be installed first when this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the sliced WAV files can be chosen in the Kodierer and thus the desired file format. in the first opening, there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a distorted compression for audio data) on the tab for setting the code. other coders can be added to this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"the Kodierer package must be installed by the concerned Linux distribution, before the Kodierer can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined Kodierer. more information about Kodierer are in the chapter Welcher Kodierer."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a codile, further information on his switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consoles window (eg; konsole)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the setup of the device recording of the & CD; / DVD drives, the writing and reader of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with a step for step example. even if you use other settings, these tips can give you how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, all understood, but are somehow still unsure what to do is? well, no problem, follow this step for-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those fields that make the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time to read everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">"it must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution, as it is not totally free software for example, as it is not completely free software to compile, what you can always do."</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you have screened it (eg; by trying to copy something in the conqueror something).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic specification of & kaudiocreator; something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">"the second section describes how to read a & CD, which must be repeated for every outgoing & CD."</seg>
<seg id="1549">"here we determine the suitable Kodierer to compression of music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy to use the program to download the freeDB to download the & CD; data from the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not be able to read one & CD at any time, once the appropriate settings are found."</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device-drawing is transferred to the readable program to read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">"frequently, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device drawing of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, so helps a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries for the device labels for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives."</seg>
<seg id="1553">The cardboard card General settings. here gibts do not have much to do. here can be an additional conversion to be defined. in our example everything is shown in the screenshot as shown in the screenshot.</seg>

<seg id="1557">"the second selection field is easier, is a & CD; entry found immediately that you are dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / filename or day entries, they can be changed easily. the directory / files- &gt; rename it and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde;"</seg>
<seg id="1558">"apart from this example, it is possible to note: if you want to use everything manually, so disable the selection fields and freeDB is not used. however, this is about 620 MB big, consider these twice if this is worth to use. to be selected by freeDB in the offline mode, at least the first. the mode will be set on the following carton map."</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-map general-MIDI events are translated into events that synthesizer the synthesizer."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI map which converts all the events of the Type Change patch to Bright Piano in Events of the Type Change patch to Trumpet and thus getting a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you only have a soundcard, you do not need a MIDI-map because all Soundcards GM -compatible are (including Awe - and CIS -cards, FM-devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there is no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file of hand (with your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that stores all necessary steps for the play of a piece of piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section that may appear as often as desired. however, that every appearance has a different text ID (see below)."</seg>

<seg id="1660">"please send me your map file as e-mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices, which are not general-MIDI-compatible."</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI can be formed on your specific keyboard. general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left-left side of the equation may be ignored. it is believed that the GM -patches in the correct order are subject (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is needed to put all sounds that this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard supports example (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun tapping. these include the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if now a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (thread), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term Drum patch of the patch is meant, with which every sound is a different pearl tool (drum, basin, Maracas & etc;) constitutes and not the one where the sound the sound height of the always same drum means (like him some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to give as tones on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as in the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, just as their availability. you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form notes on the perkussions channel. check out as an example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to form some channels to other. if you want to switch to the first and the second channel, you can easily switch the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi-devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section therefore has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"N is the channel, which is shown on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap should use the name name for this channel, all events will be ignored on this channel will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case the patch is always used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch can be useful for example to always use the perkussions patch on the perlad channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio gives to what the ratio Pitch-Bender-events are multiplied with the value, this with the formula n * (r / 4096) is calculated and then passed on. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file (no decimalkommas)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting will be used because GM provides a keyboard that is to play a pitch-bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, try some keyboards to play two tones up to an octave. to try the right value on your keyboard, you must taste a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. these can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of piano (one for any MIDI channel). on these piers you see which sounds are just being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument, the button is no longer green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played notes. view the view in the menu settings below the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed-LCD shows the speed, with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. if you find e.g., a song be too quick to follow the text, you can slow down. to change the speed, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc;. thus, the same MIDI file may result in two different devices to different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes on a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I cannot force anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while an mp3 file 4 MB needs a similar sound quality. in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binder distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; having compiled the problem. to remove the problem you need to download a source code and install (for example by kmid; 's mainpage)"</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewers for system protokolle. the program is suitable for unwanted users who can't know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files. additionally it allows for quick access to the example of information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of the own system. the program is suitable for unridden users who cannot know where you can get information about your system or where the system deposited the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users access fast access to information about problems which occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore attempts to provide some advanced functions, with which help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful features. this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files for the format of syslog servers and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you see in the following screenshot, presents & ksystemlog; functions available with which help the individual protocol lines are easily filtered and sort. the individual opportunities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this handbook."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after starting to start & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol. will not display it, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have been running under Linux folder / var / log, for the normal user usually no justification for reading."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter for a chosen criterion or after given character labels. the list of the log lines will now automatically be displayed, so that only log-line will be displayed in the default setting. then a protocol line contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search engines will be included."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can also select a different entry in this place. select the string of the filter concept, then select the column procedure, and enter the name of a process, so shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines are sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to identify the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level errors are displayed with a conspicuous color as protocol lines of the level note. the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you only want to show a specific process (for example in the system protocol or in cron protocol), so you can examine the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case you use filtering bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window, to display all new added protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open additional subwindow and to control. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol on display."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort find out more about the sources of sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and in the following also named) as a ksysv; this section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init develops rapidly to the standard for the control of the program for the high-up of the system in the & Linux world. therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go here on historical aspects (e.g. because I do not know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. it is therefore important because anyone could try to make a machine based on System V Init, without a new installation and re-format. therefore, you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Inite is also different from the BSD Init, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is named rc.d. Dort, you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service that you want to boot up to another Runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such matters such as setboards, which are only once started. such views include rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be in part with / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems possess this file, even if it does not have much use for this. you can also make a rc.level in / etc / rc.d if you want to carry something to do with the seriousness."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places after the program init and starts the first that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the specified Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can change your etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. be very careful when you are able to restart the system by reboot the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you want -l enter in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no proper files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written, that it's an argument as start and stop. you can actually launch this script from hand on the command line below:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one K includes, the script will be called with the argument. if it includes a S, the script will be called with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way of set machines for many purposes. I could have & win; a server-runlevel, which can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. moreover, I could also have a user -Runlevel;, network & etc; start."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was used as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start him on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can move scripts between Runlevles or change the position within a level by moving elsewhere. this only does not happen if they draw an entry from the range of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved, if you select this in a new area. to select it only to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select copying from the menu editing or from the context menu - even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of a entry may sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again, add the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently there is no possibility to restore entries, which were thrown into the trash. be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to enable the different workplaces (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons to meet a selection of top or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another Runlevel, move it with Auscut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired Runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a entry manually, press the entry button to open the properties dialog. use the tabulator button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to make the changes, or press esc to throw the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data transfer, all entries in the menu file require confirmation, before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"all settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. if settings are available from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise, they are stored by & ksysv; otherwise, changes to preferences will be stored in a local ksysvrc."</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runlevles and now the machine starts up-resistant. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard Runlevel at a reasonable value (3 should normally be ok).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SUSE; or Delix (DLD) then you have to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the type, as system services are launched in these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution: please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply end up without a message when their configuration files are not present or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this handbook can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & user; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to begin with & kuser; to begin, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you made modifications, you need to save it. either use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or entry storing in the menu file."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"& kuser; is an easy application. the main window consists of two cardboard cards, user interface and user list. for editing, select the desired user or the desired group with a double-clicking on the entry. it appears the dialog user interface or group features."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some carton cards are only represented if you have extended system settings. only if you have limited space settings (Quota) for users, a cardboard card will be made available if shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD-Unixen are installed."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the carton map will be released, in case shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD -Unixen are installed."</seg>
<seg id="2995">This box card appears only if for at least a built-in file storage system (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognisable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can modify parameters for each user while the limited restrictions are in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted for each file system individually. the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the cardboard card groups informs about the group members of the selected user. the default group, which the user belongs, you will find in the field Primary group. furthermore, the user can highlight in other groups by highlight them in the great field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the dialog properties of the group includes a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or a group, select from the menu user or group or click on the appropriate added button of the toolbar. the editing or deleting of the selected user or the selected group works analogue."</seg>
<seg id="3000">"with this module you can install the LILO boot manager, adding the boot menu, remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove the operating systems, remove and change more."</seg>
