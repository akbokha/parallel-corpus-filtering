&quot; although I visited the US for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceptionally big .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , American authors read and operated his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly due to a American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gr@@ ay Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ical conspir@@ acy of an oil magn@@ ates , who were the first federal court with judges who were his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free according to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , had my admir@@ ation for the US only . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting that you are always the one that you are , and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had a very dirty love cover about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me as he goes with his Eng@@ ines .
he never stops his opinion behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague put it , and explains openly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have re@@ acted upon his statements and voted in weakness for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes which he won in the Republi@@ can pres@@ election , was the highest number one ever reached from the party candidate . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans , who support this big@@ ons person , asked me ? &quot;
I could not bring Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people that I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist program , people from all over the world took up a deep gl@@ it@@ ant man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; also , Tru@@ mp@@ s Welt@@ belief is not associated with the Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix Suns &quot; in the game .
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s intoler@@ ance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity that I lived in Sandy B@@ ahr who lived for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still adap@@ ts to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ l , who always helped with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues , to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me much in my career . &quot;
these people and those by them em@@ bo@@ died values in depth my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp &apos;s path to the nom@@ inated Republi@@ can presidential election , they offered me a grip and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 about 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they were either shared with racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to describe the Tru@@ mp @-@ voters as R@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; to arrange people , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and respectful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in another way and think .
it shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities will not be considered .
&quot; could it be that these voters have voted for Tru@@ mp , because they want to gain control over a country , which she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they perhaps wanted to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look differently . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( m . ) . : as much as &quot; &quot; stretch of the White against all the other eth@@ ni@@ cs &quot; ; &quot; words from white in An@@ plat@@ ung on the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as it was the great Van Jones calling , exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate American Ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is nonetheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you might have always like , America is also welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ ian@@ ers , whose history , as he himself says , anywhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again on the ruin , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowds . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a lau@@ gh &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; answered them . &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they called them and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received an atmospheric and lau@@ gh @-@ strong &quot; NO . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son was like , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s Country , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find any place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart me .

what has the Mexican College of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero church in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ic city Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
&quot; that the music , which is played in both locations , not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a big gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen . &quot;
&quot; for a few years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ Leb@@ de ) has now been playing in the municipality : one of children and adults existing Symphony Orchestra , which has found a way to overcome poverty . &quot;
a Musik@@ schule with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the gangs . &quot;
&quot; yet , this changed after an acci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and offered the youth so a rare hope . &quot;
the young band members take their commitments compared to the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to meet their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come and play with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the trust you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , B@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from Mu@@ gar@@ bage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically at the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay of the capital - on instruments that are made of re@@ usable waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re @-@ prepared instruments , made from local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the recycling led under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ i@@ ve viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , double @-@ bass , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and perc@@ ussion , which were all made out of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire covers classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ical and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local Eco @-@ ologist and Musi@@ cians of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the initial time : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach in the same place , the children known in the tr@@ ash worked no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : one out of waste made violin .
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments of re @-@ prepared material and called The Rec@@ ycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary names called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ical gar@@ bage dump ) is characterised by the musical performance :
the world creates approximately one billion tonnes of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura ; Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational spectacle from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has played his music even before Pope Franzis@@ kus :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork is able to fight against illegal fishing .
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fighting .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ release happens as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for shared use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was then known that this ship had already operated in liber@@ ated waters of illegal fishing , before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were raised about accordingly , and little gen@@ ces to welcome a criminal @-@ crus@@ her of this type at its shores . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ ers , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobili@@ zed rapidly against the ship . they refuse to lay one of their ports and refuse to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply deny everything &quot; , &quot; reminds Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the Ken@@ yan fisheries Authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship and followed . &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch the fish there .
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to liber@@ ia , due to pill@@ age of fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crossed and resources protects , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing ( Ill@@ eg@@ ale fishing ) . &quot;
the members of this network are next to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had driven the prime minister out of their waters .
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equal and work together . they exchange information and are mutually exclusive where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is captured will be hidden today which is extremely difficult due to it . thus the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing regions .
&quot; by inten@@ tional dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species should be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems will have harm , which have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were displ@@ aced by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ dles , with the information between individual countries , so does the actions happen in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital platform . &quot;
&quot; here , the individual countries can exchange with each other for example lists of existing licenses , news to diges@@ tive activities or details , which one noticed or experienced during a port spec@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , if these are moving on the open seas , through satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to mark the authorities to mark ships which fish in ban areas . also , such a suspic@@ ious driver can discover , such that a ship invites its fired fish to other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ideal case , such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence , where they were traveling and possibly , whether they have a criminal register . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , can refuse the adoption of such vessels in their ports . what does the ships will not sell their charge into their ports . and that they can even be forced for the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s then about considerable financial losses for the owners , which means the illegal fishing turn is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve &quot; , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leader Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the aforementioned platform was created to gain more estimated 20 million USD at lost sales , who lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of the illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate into East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una @-@ fish farms , which attracts the region of commercial fishing from around the world . among these also illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; among other things , these actions include like sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit licensing , the fish protected species and fish in nature conservation areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; you specifically use the lack of international cooperation and make sure the weaknesses of a non @-@ complete control system use &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could be illeg@@ ally fish and a country could then say &apos; You won &apos;t join my port . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this leg@@ ale Schl@@ up@@ ch tries F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front operates .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects ships . &quot;
&quot; it has been criminal networks exposed , the counter@@ f@@ ake licenses used in Tanzania . it discovered vessels which used several fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ical identi@@ ties and it has tr@@ acked ships and found whis@@ per@@ ed ships . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ POL , the International Authority on combating crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across great distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; it builds a system , the F@@ ISH @-@ i is to help , diges@@ ted ships precise . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that will always be developed further , helping us hide the illegal ships who likes to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tr@@ acking , an NGO , which also deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships turn off for example its automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be harv@@ ested by satellites . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects various information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i help to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a Modell@@ bau
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations can actually affect the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed by means of the position of every single ver@@ trac@@ eable ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - this is simply sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bund@@ le their resources for the investigation . &quot;
we should do this on a global level . &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system will allow the persecution of ships .
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel crimin@@ als , but also sc@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; ships , which were used earlier without a license and hardly to reck@@ oned with consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats have more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped , Gre@@ ko 1 , found the inspection there on board to@@ wed , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice this success . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that us now also copy other countries &quot; , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a academic objective . &quot; &quot; in West Africa disappear several hundred million dollars by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there are six countries assembled in 2015 , to the so called West Africa Task Force . also they are now fighting the illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model like F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With certainty the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest members of Somalia report on his first major triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was under fal@@ ter flag . and not only was the ship used without a license and were used to tow , which is now banned . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated in ban waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the Take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 put it a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such special , collaborative approach to protect the oceans really works throughout the cosmos . Emma Bry@@ ce is fre@@ el@@ ance journalist and lives in London . there , it writes on environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela has continued to go further to : demonstrations in several cities with the goal to reg@@ ain the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fier@@ ce demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
&quot; this picture of Mar@@ ía Al@@ ej@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Marac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 . &quot;

&quot; after the government of Venezuela had rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on the amalg@@ amation , re@@ acted the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations were gathered through the political and economic crisis of the country into the emp@@ tin@@ ess that they were gathered around the streets . &quot;
under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the flat region of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions of Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located north @-@ north of the Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and Isla Margar@@ ita in the State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ating constantly , which is noticeable in the daily life of the Vene@@ tians by an acute lack of foods and drugs . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw in the amalg@@ amation of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change , but ultimately the post@@ ure of a re@@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , takes place in its latest article in the context of the Government of Govern@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the in@@ flow rate and winn@@ ings are among the highest in all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a gra@@ v@@ ative and broad lack of food and medicine is considered the only way to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and close a new governance . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures that tell about disputes , as well as reports of repression and failure . &quot;
&quot; especially large waves , the message on poli@@ cing oppression in the central north @-@ located city Marac@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; there , the prot@@ esters moved back into the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves according to its own statement from the police and armed supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country tried to hold some demonstr@@ ators , the police forces , including those woman in the An@@ den@@ cy T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira carry no tube , because you could see anything else , which did not have many nation@@ als ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , there is already a Info@@ graphic of the round which forms the scale of repression per day : &quot;
so the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
&quot; many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an amalg@@ amation procedure , which was now proved in the eyes of many through the presence of countless people on the street . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview of Al@@ ejo Gó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father , the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the Province of Cordoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on August 24th 2016 , crimes were examined , committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting with the Bür@@ de , the same name as his father to carry the brutal mil@@ ations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he was observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
34 years he beh@@ aving the family ger@@ m for himself .
in the situation then I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child of 15 years , one can &apos;t notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I could not know at that time , that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gig from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state ror@@ ism , was his father of 1976 to 1978 Vice @-@ Chairman of the secrecy of 141 in the prison La Per@@ la . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
archi@@ val version .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor which is charged for ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows what great power has a parent on his child , and how this child elected a way of salvation . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I went to the sports hall . there I was sho@@ ok with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
&quot; all called him &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I told my father of him , and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend . &quot;
he said :
you are a ar@@ ch@@ ole you have got you with one of the ERP sho@@ cks .
pass merely to that she will not lead you one day and I must save you .
the Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ perate del Pu@@ eb@@ lo - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina .
&quot; therefore he offered me to go back into the sports hall . some days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would be a secret . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old , and in the situation I thought that would be ok . for so my father had moved me . &quot;
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy the papers that heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university closures , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ ag@@ and@@ amat@@ erial , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ da in practice the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time he took me to asc@@ end . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little in a ceiling bag , and comm@@ anded me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump in silver . &quot;
&quot; on this day I went to the other end of the bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the stolen items were ab@@ sent and oppressed me with an wax . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open room and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I sp@@ rang up , and saw a li@@ ege that were tor@@ tured on the people . &quot;
she looked like a dirt and metal springs .
later I found out that she fortified it at an end of a cab@@ al . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was right there .
&quot; it rarely has a man with hand@@ shake to the bed , over@@ shot him with water and j@@ ailed him a charge of 220 Volt into gen@@ itals . &quot;

the Gest@@ ank there was f@@ oul ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house ar@@ rest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I was clear that the smell of a body in need is .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do with another as much sor@@ row ?
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with palms and were tr@@ aded . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who also was indic@@ ted in the process ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mat@@ tresses on which naked people with the face below - they were captiv@@ ated at hands and feet .
close to the entrance kis@@ sed people still on the mat@@ tresses .
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ est thou so , ar@@ hole ? &quot;
&quot; I asked , Why do you have brought me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told home of this .
&quot; besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms , which were described as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there was a man and sol@@ dered .
&quot; according to the survi@@ vor@@ s of the civil society Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process , the students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death . &quot;
&quot; the following video leads Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former Fol@@ ter@@ chambers . &quot;
&quot; the path , where you came here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apped came here . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the map , see that they were about this road and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names have been changed and they got a number assigned as part of the process of relief . &quot;
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of above came , that they should be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; warfare &apos;
my father brought all the possible things with their home .
at that age in the age I had no idea what the &quot; warfare &quot; - as they called it .
&quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war is a B@@ aj@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that one takes an enemy that one has fought for . &quot;

&quot; but if you go to a house and the fridge , the record player , clothing , paintings , money ... sti@@ cs , then this is no war @-@ liber@@ alism but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always asked me like my father , the head of the security forces , in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply understand it .
I was also officers in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and to ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a crime and I answered , and thou that you were cars on the road ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before anger , made me and cri@@ ed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and embrace you . &quot;
we do not need any other !
so my father was .
I have not only a good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that at that time , on which I carried a jack@@ et and a bike swe@@ ater of w@@ ool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes at home . &quot;
&quot; then , then , the defense , a co @-@ rebellion in this crime have been to be . I res@@ ist , no problem , they can lay me to the burden what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to di@@ ct .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearances of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find Reu@@ el . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you only have children , one recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have thus spoken during the dictatorship of man . but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children are kidn@@ apped ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with his father , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked me the question : you were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it was simply possible to put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
did these people not also have families where you could pass on to the remains of the remains of the remains ?
the sc@@ iss@@ ant of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that you can do a man .
&quot; my father told me , when democracy was again introduced , they took machines to eliminate the im@@ mor@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crus@@ hed and somewhere out - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; said my Father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &apos; &quot; &quot;
only to get it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the g@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said only the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the thought to indicate my Father , was born during a conversation , when he was under house ar@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; I made him hel@@ pl@@ ess because of all of the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience . &quot;
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone .
&quot; I felt afraid and wonder@@ ed why the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; , &quot; which they were alleg@@ edly defended . &quot;
then I cri@@ ed :
how can you tell me what to say ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed horrible crimes and you were forced to participate as a child .
he rep@@ elled only &quot; &quot; Na then I &apos;m going to . &quot;
this is what I did .
in 2010 I was refundable .
I was finally recognized that he was a criminal .
no one can blame me that I am taken . I finally told against my own Father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 at Haus@@ ar@@ rest below before the end of the process .
&quot; he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping one under 10 year old child . &quot;

&quot; a translation defect makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto where one can extend his leadership .
the photo was spread in social media .
editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese town Kyoto , customers became a newly opened center in which one can extend his leadership in the last month witnesses of a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word has to be seen at home ( Cor@@ ei@@ ft@@ sha ) , the &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; , &quot; said , perhaps also with mal@@ icious back@@ wards &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; terrible drivers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the false translation was from 1st to 20th of September to read electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
adapting the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine which was often shared in social media .
&quot; the error was the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also that the loc@@ al@@ time spent on it . &quot;
the Kyoto newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , although gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct name &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Pre@@ fecture , Kyoto exc@@ els for the translation error . furthermore , they stated that the error was already contained in the text they had been reviewed by the transl@@ ator and that the translation has not been checked for their correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we sincerely sorry that older people felt through the inadequate correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; said the Police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ cast News continued to deal with the phenomenon of &quot; awesome &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; horri@@ bly &quot; was referred to as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the share of older mot@@ orists is involved in accidents , but are certainly the reason to worry . &quot;
&quot; in the Pre@@ fecture , Kyoto for instance , was caused in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of total 19.@@ 460 accidents of seniors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , caused seniors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has declined in total , the proportion of senior inci@@ dents has risen in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the author does not mentioned re@@ por@@ ter in the article published on Yahoo published comments to the light , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese is apparently against older mot@@ orists : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo on the translation error , among other things , the following comments : &quot;
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) about not the reality ?
&quot; so sorry , the translation is not at all , or ? &quot;
&quot; I do not find that this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true location for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
&quot; to over@@ set , one needs two important features : passive voice skills to understand the starting text and transfer an active language skills to transfer him into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is in mat@@ ernity in the case . in general , the conviction that transl@@ ators should be in the target language - not in the primary language - native language . &quot;
this should be a French native language for example from English to French - not from French to German .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies employ not employ co @-@ workers with English as a native language , which might be translation into English . this may be attri@@ but@@ able to lack of understanding , quot@@ ations or the relatively small number of English speakers that can learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees , the translations are still pre @-@ oriented internally . then the Japanese staff will be applied to the transl@@ ators , no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ ens and mysterious propositions which are created by machine translation , show that this technique can not replace a long life transl@@ ator for a long time . this applies to several languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the most strange English phr@@ as@@ ings in Japan , including the mysterious record @-@ prints , which often decor@@ ate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable nor acceptable or at least harmless . but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , one can expect more careful translations . &quot;
Kyoto City will hopefully use a serious source of their translations in the future .
Venezuela : take protests and assur@@ ances on the internet and television
main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7th , mel@@ ted Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet use that they had no access to the online transm@@ itter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet pres@@ ences of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online transm@@ itter recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , who res@@ ists the government Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court was dis@@ solved the Parliament and transferred the task of the Parliament to the Executive and the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is ch@@ illed , and received the u@@ ters , VP@@ N ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VP@@ N .
it seems that Internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an Provider are once again locked .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , traditional media have been involved in the reporting of protests . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations would continue to report with banknotes and closing , as the Commission would continue to report on the demonstrations , since the Commission called this as a &quot; Call for Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this continues to be cheaper than two lit@@ res of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro was later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay through a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) is in@@ accessible , but also two other online transm@@ itter . this also concerns the website , on which the National Assembly has survived their sessions . &quot;
&quot; previous post @-@ research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had to use the local internet provider to use DNS . this is a technique that l@@ acked the DNS server requests of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server fails or denied the request when calling on such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS system : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; with V@@ PI@@ TV , a third ges@@ per@@ r@@ ten channel , the transfer was released on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ PI@@ TV Cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who was transferred to the protests in Car@@ acas . &quot;
Flor@@ es was be@@ aten while he was in police force .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back on shipment . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : there@@ with the Venezu@@ el@@ ers access to multi@@ medi@@ al reporting about the current events in the country more and more complicated . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , a lot of girls will become slave to maintain a training . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was a child of cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina for the rights of children and gath@@ ers witness of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were exactly how they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo of Cecilia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly permission of cures .
&quot; the following article is the shor@@ tened version of a report by Kur@@ dish , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kindly permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series called &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Flying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and published again . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived eight years in a household , where they did not live together with the family who lived there , eat . &quot;
shortly before their degree of degree at the University she returned to the house again and heard the owner of the house full of pride about she said . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; that has become something that has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was never treated in this house like a daughter .
&quot; when she became ten years old , she started to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , one is called Cri@@ ad@@ itas in Paraguay that are more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money over@@ comes their min@@ ors @-@ old son or her min@@ der daughter to another , richest family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children must pay countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of mis@@ use and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up . &quot;
&quot; this is widely used as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints about human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ enga worked a couple of years for an organisation which fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered witness , resear@@ ched and p@@ ran@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that will vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guaranteed in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family that her daughter is in the faith that they can complete their education , improve their position in society and get something out of himself , to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family is taking care of the girl in itself and whose exploitation with the belief that they would give someone a chance that otherwise wouldn &apos;t get any training and maybe even star@@ ving . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is wrong , his family will experience many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never find out of it .
&quot; in January 2016 , this has so far been relatively un@@ familiar phenomenon that takes place in the hiding in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú in the hospital , her body showed traces of violent sho@@ cks . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former mil@@ der Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official office in the population .
&quot; Mar@@ ín was living in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra struck up with a stick to Mar@@ ín , until they suffered fatal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the mur@@ dered child was a cri@@ mp .
organisations such as UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the profound practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
she signed the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest and demanded that there are no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the married and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid study of the case .
&quot; they want the Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ ad@@ ita , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case is in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ l@@ ite might be rich@@ ly - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is brought to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited as labour force ; they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old when the far@@ ewell , in which her father worked , cons@@ ulted , and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; your brothers now had to work all together , and began to sell on the street or on the market of sweets , to earn money . &quot;
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent as a Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ enga worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn . &quot;
she stood at five hours every morning and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
&quot; for example , they puri@@ fy the refrigerator , p@@ used the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
&quot; however , this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer too . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ enga says it was never hungry , but was also not un@@ restricted food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the land@@ lady than eating out of the fridge , &quot; reminds them . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ er of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was held in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some cases of the hous@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ enga , to stand alongside him and to read Editorial from Op@@ position@@ ings such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to convince the reports of the official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; he held her for intelligent , but did not speak with her . &quot; &quot; the hous@@ eholder had found someone who spoke , while he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would learn there again &quot; bad habit . &quot; that said Al@@ var@@ enga that belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , home again to their native language Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they had the formation , which they had allowed to lose again , explains it . &quot;
&quot; however , it was completely clear that they had paid for everything they had paid from them with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in the school Al@@ var@@ enga has been discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken , bullying and the chic@@ ks are exposed to which Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed when they go to school . &quot;

&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , in which you can view advertisements for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s n@@ anny in Paraguay . &quot;

hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .

please sign up .
start from Monday if possible .
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she could have been a year@@ long girl and gave their phone number .
&quot; another woman , which also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ light . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the inland region , which would like to work . &quot;
then altern@@ ate the fi@@ bres in the display once more :
&quot; dear friends , I have found a found . I look at whether it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again if something is . &quot;
the business was completed .

&quot; ( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long still ? ) , a collection of witnesses say former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history we managed to prevent systems like slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( an economic system during the Spanish conquest , the women of the Guar@@ an@@ í ) and to their &quot; wives . &quot; therefore , it is not to justify that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery in which they become light victims for abuse and exploitation . &quot;
social inequality in Paraguay and that at the show power is the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
legisl@@ ates writes Egyptian users of social media to register with government

sixty Egyptian Parliament in recent times have recently agreed to the regul@@ arities in terms of use and usability of social networks .
&quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , users and users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law a job would then be set up , which is engaged in order to give citizens a permit to give social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , users would have to register users and users on the site of the site with their proper name and personnel numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it failed to do this , this might bring forth a punishment of up to six months in jail or an ATM . &quot;
&quot; the bill that consists of six Par@@ agr@@ arian , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , vide@@ on@@ ach@@ ers and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced when the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities should be imposed on how the Egyptian authorities should not register for the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Parliament of Parliament and sponsors of the legal situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received by telecommunications Ministry of user name and a password &quot; to come by the Fire@@ wall , which Facebook blocked . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to rede@@ em a fire@@ wall on the national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary for Egypt and Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known so far that such plans are .
experts on site are skep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research T@@ echnolog@@ ist ( in German &quot; conduc@@ tivity &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , &quot; said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I &apos;m strong in the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they make it possible to control the physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take them seriously , then this means that they are set up a strong surveillance system to apply citizens or not . and this means a mad@@ man system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed during the legislative Parliament and the Constitutional Treaty before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft itself is in line with a pro @-@ military mind in parliament , in whose sense control is maxim@@ ized and ensuring that no sof@@ tening scar is present on the surface , says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year the parliament@@ arians of Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy proposed a legislative situation against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long prison sentence for those who were found guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards that stems from Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find less pre@@ y . &quot;
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dominant in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem , and the health and the prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big rob@@ bery is present . &quot;
the chance to see an Persian leop@@ ards actually in the free hunting is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video is therefore determined that they have a big cat in the cam@@ er@@ af@@ ers breaks r@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .

&quot; in the beginning of March 2017 , documented for the northe@@ ast@@ ern jap@@ anese daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a vast earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Send@@ ai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture , in the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ asi@@ an were forced out because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappear whole coastal towns of the map .
&quot; in addition , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima a nuclear accident had already had to leave their houses for more than 160 000 inhabitants . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from local point of view the progress made for six years later to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and survey results of those affected itself .
&quot; the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iv@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that until December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare part @-@ houses ( with children ) , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the Pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iv@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; among the three pre@@ fecture , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could draw Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , more than 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed . &quot;
&quot; Iw@@ asi@@ an has 75 percent of such houses completed , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima with 70 percent form the balance . &quot;
&quot; however , it still makes every effort to move even six years after the disaster , evac@@ u@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald . &quot; ( , &quot; , &quot; , cas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) , in final spare parts . &quot;
after the triple catastrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live under control accommodation .
&quot; in December 2016 , there are still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ asi@@ an . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 per cent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency accommodation , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful than 75 percent of the evac@@ uation , who were hau@@ led after the disaster in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ pad , were converted into final houses . &quot;
for Iw@@ asi@@ an the number is here at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ con@@ tours
&quot; how the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by evil until December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of schools of the three pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fecture is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while almost 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bors in Iv@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , have re @-@ recorded in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours its operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have drawn up in the three pre@@ fecture of agricultural land large @-@ scale . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iv@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed A@@ cker@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear war , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of break@@ able ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the &quot; nuclear zone zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fecture , tourism has recovered and recovered , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far off . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ asi@@ an are back to 90 percent on the same stand as before . Fu@@ kus@@ hima however , can only be 75 percent here . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake ?
&quot; to determine a total picture , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys among the native people and under the evac@@ uation by . they asked them about the state of re@@ building and also how to find out with the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native people .
&quot; the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local resident , measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 55.@@ 9 percent of the respon@@ dents , that still has not been done enough in case of disasters prevention . &quot;
as it stands for those who had to evac@@ u@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
in her edition to the anniversary of the earthquake the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has focused their attention also on the situation of evac@@ u@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , dis@@ astro@@ us , atomic disorder , the Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 evac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima almost 63 000 people were raised in areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23 000 people came back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the booth of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; most of the evac@@ uation areas are most of the evac@@ uation , which still need to reg@@ ain in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald accommodation , older than 50 years old . they have to compete in proper control projects , which are part of the Olympic Games , which are part of the Olympic Games , which will take place in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when one encounters people from other countries , who speak another language , the differences appear to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recogni@@ zes that one more connects it than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and remind us that the world ultimately is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look exactly this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with issues that will often get less attention in the reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly linked to someone over language and country borders .
&quot; Les@@ i Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man declared their affection for the Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Camar@@ asa spoke about the time , where she worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil which came to brutal police officers last Friday .
&quot; polic@@ emen set up in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had established a stage for speakers , rubber @-@ com@@ rade and tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via speaker to refrain on violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers around the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media street is dil@@ uted by giving the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted via a zer@@ bro@@ w glass window to make use of a photo their title @-@ based illustrations .
&quot; in contrast , the O Glo@@ bo preferred a title story with a fire @-@ set bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic cause , more about a broken window t@@ apping than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special matter . &quot;
this is also necessary to recognise if one is strictly opposed to any form of atomic damage .

most of the in@@ in@@ duced villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar@@ s factories in Cuba closed the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the People &apos;s Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western cub@@ an Province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of that there are no n@@ enn@@ able sugar harv@@ ested on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were laid .
&quot; after the view there stood still the sugar cane industry in the region , and the factory lost after and after its facilities , until only the ru@@ mor made of steel and concrete left . &quot;
about 272 workers had to be re@@ discovered .
some are rarely the work .
&quot; other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ es and pen@@ ises daily for the factories , which are still ma@@ stered . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an that is open every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar ro@@ aming industry does not smoke his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region sugar@@ be@@ et factories , which are again into operation after a long in@@ active time because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he was not expected .
N@@ ene reminds us exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane @-@ factory , but the promise has not been held . &quot;
&quot; the sweet@@ ening industry has already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decision and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production of 1,6 million tons of sugar was reduced , less than the 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for several decades ago , but the bad harvest have been no news . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar be@@ et industry ?
the old rail sti@@ g of the church saw already better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic need : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ portable for the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to focus production on most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar@@ s on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar@@ s rose from about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 &quot; &quot; Agricultural Policy &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production of 2001 would be achieved ( 3,@@ 6 million tons ) , the raw sugar export would manage to be approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the day of today will come with certainty into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
from there to the process of restructuring in the sugar industry .
&quot; in the following years the lac@@ tation of a total of 98 sugar@@ s factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar ro@@ hr@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene is known as a soldier , about the closing of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was notified that the factory would be tac@@ kl@@ ed .
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full time - working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially recognized documents , which would only be removed by the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could take any discharge . &quot;
from there the responsibility was over and the letters come more and more frequently .
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for two years for the still@@ ery factory , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will in the breast@@ feeding of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with any part , which he removed , dismant@@ led he of his 31 work years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and more important work producers was er@@ ased .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives were provided for working and services that generated plants in the municipalities where they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut speech of 21 October 2002 , who saw President in the eyes of the present persons , as he guaranteed that for five years , whose factories were no longer running in operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane sugar
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is extrac@@ ted only high through the bl@@ asting . &quot;

&quot; after two years the People &apos;s Greg@@ ory Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ me learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; as the bar@@ bell factory closed , or better said than they began , they dis@@ assem@@ ble , they also heard on the road to asp@@ hal@@ ted , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with an advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories . &quot;
you have been split to spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area a food factory was created , its production serves not even for supplying the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant is still impos@@ ing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;

&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour has been preparing mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centers , to help youth groups of song@@ writing , recording , audi@@ o- and video @-@ producing and live performances . &quot;
the original workshops were led by the Ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges that lives in Montreal and worked in north @-@ Quebec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked together with the C@@ ree Hip Hop Group The North@@ Stars .
&quot; the workshop is increasing that the young participants in talks are like &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptance or whatever comes in mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos;@@ Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells for example the history of the Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway of the tears , &quot; in which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ resolved .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the mot@@ if of a video game to convey how important is the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influence of globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in Indi@@ gen@@ ous languages , although the young people are not always aware of the languages of the First Nations language . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First nation have recorded , the Re@@ f@@ rain is sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
the young people involved some help from Gary Jol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hip Hop group that gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
&quot; on the Fac@@ ebook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the st@@ rop@@ he is at your disposal , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if nobody ever are interested in me
but I try to go on earth my days
that is the day where you will take our cry
because we lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise to one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this way they can grow and also approach our youth
this is how they can do what it determines the Creator
in the commentary box the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the st@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ scription ( which is published on his blog and published here with permission ) :

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are close to the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( , &quot; &quot; Pl@@ astic models of the courts &quot; ) of every meal , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers look at this plastic dishes and then decide whether to enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ oter district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small companies that make the German fil@@ mm@@ akers Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a prior to more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usually that they are no longer stri@@ pped over to them . however , a new trend turns them today into show@@ piece cell accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome , the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series published by social media links and photos that show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ku@@ n san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale , new with plastic @-@ off decor@@ ate cell hing@@ es , as shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned to kit@@ sch@@ y collecting , as in this case , refriger@@ ation mag@@ net : &quot;
here are a couple of sho@@ ots cooler for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
the new boom of the ess@@ ings will become increasingly costly .
in this case a ca@@ is@@ en @-@ don was transformed ( a popular travel shell with seafood ) into a cell phone .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
we also have made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo station .
and here is an apple that contains your cell phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of a growing flight to the com@@ ic .
&quot; some cell phone and mobile phones allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon is used , a popular T@@ opping which is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say , &quot; Wow , cool , now I can conf@@ use my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot;
I believe I will probably be the one .
this interest in plastic courts may also assume a less appe@@ tizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members .
our new mobile phone stand has the shape of mel@@ ting ice cream .
&quot; in addition , there is also Rei@@ s@@ b@@ ables ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , Ear@@ rings and Hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; more sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes can be viewed under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the has@@ ht@@ ag # , &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , who is dedicated to the Bel@@ iefs of the restaurant industry . such as with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes actually are produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports and foreign media through the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trading &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ hes and com@@ ets regularly diving only in statistics . however , these are not reflected in the extent of the human tragedy , which brings this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the reporting of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ on , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , no one looks to the grape or the congreg@@ ations that have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bone , behind each bone radi@@ ators in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wo@@ unds may never heal . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico is called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with drug handel live &quot; ) , which give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who gr@@ ated in the fight between the criminal law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much profound .
&quot; for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug levels , and whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( English : &quot; how fear Life changed &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is seeking every weekend secret gra@@ ves after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost only one day her father , her four sisters , her husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today again on the task that we have provided us , go and to gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my Father , but that does not pay her out , because that demand a ster@@ o@@ ist . &quot;
where are we supposed to get ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid of . we must show the international community , the inter@@ rup@@ tions and the state of the state . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexican . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you never should consider violence as normal , regardless of what form it occurs : &quot;
I have now know disease and sensation journ@@ alism for some years now .
&quot; I come past every day on time boxes , and see the front pages with images , which can actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from Ak@@ ten specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel the feeling as if I am the One who was sho@@ cked or sad . it works , like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body once . &quot;
I cannot be valid or consider this as normal .
she also writes on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year cous@@ in thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( English : drug ret@@ ailer ) if it is great . and it is also not normal that people listen to the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; &quot; of offen@@ ders , if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , this is what they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have happened so something . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories come to mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of the human being is incredible to me , if the death of six people and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students in a neigh@@ bor to be justified by that they were &quot;
I think they try to speak that they are spar@@ ed by such trag@@ e@@ dies when they are not tou@@ red and silent .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City has written the contribution &quot; Four months of ext@@ or@@ tion in the Haupt@@ stadt@@ kultur@@ al : like a family with dr@@ en@@ ings . it describes how armed crimin@@ als month for month money was destroyed by their business , until they had not only destroyed the business , but also their family apart . &quot;
you are thinking about everything you lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain is never wast@@ ed , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear is coming back , when you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
she shut her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will dec@@ eive you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in this terrible days , whether wines would dis@@ solve my profound feelings , but the answers is no , because I have forgotten how to cri@@ es . I must learn to live with pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of violence marked by violence .
in the introduction he raises questions on how : who takes care of the child of an missing woman and a man who was mur@@ dered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous town of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; br@@ yan is a Wa@@ ise and he says that he had to teach yourself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies , who live with him . this is his name for preparing the rivers with water , sugar and milk pul@@ sing . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live .
&quot; when he was five years old , he said to him that his mother disappeared . &quot;
&quot; but this was not the day when his childhood ended . &quot;
&quot; his childhood has been past two years earlier than just a few blocks from his home , the bloody Lei@@ che of his father saw that was shot by armed men from a squ@@ ir@@ t car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most vulnerable city in the world due to the number of murder according to the civil Council for public safety and government government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ ut@@ or 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this is equivalent to 8,5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundred thousand stories that organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in view of always new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim consists of the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trading , which has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades , in comprehen@@ sible manner . &quot;
if one picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ ARN@@ ING : this post and the sides to which he linked linked , contain images , on which violence is represented . &quot;
&quot; the Fak@@ ten@@ check is important in a moment , in which it is about to lift out a ru@@ mor or for@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years after something the first time emerged ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first publication it was mis@@ leading to use trag@@ e@@ dies , which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupl@@ ing of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; fal@@ ter context &quot; &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dr@@ aft News - deny not the fact that there are abundant careful reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
it raises questions about our desire for images on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 a pet@@ rol stations led the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded to 230 people . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths of head@@ holes that were difficult to drive . &quot;
pregnant fell to the victim of the pet@@ rol station to the victim .
&quot; official representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dual @-@ time houses covered , including a cin@@ emas in the vicinity , which was full of people who show the soccer world championship . &quot;
houses betra@@ yed and shor@@ ten cor@@ p@@ ines in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to the ignorance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User My@@ stic Mon@@ key , 12 January 2015 Extra photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows ranks of shor@@ tened body that are mounted on the ground while people watch them .
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was imposed several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not related to the trag@@ e@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 at the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am the Nig@@ erian villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o Go@@ won .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically from atro@@ cities to whom they had to fl@@ ee .
houses and shops have been crus@@ hed and cor@@ pse in streets and cer@@ eals .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one remained back to count Lei@@ chen , &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were sm@@ ashed , shot or burnt . &quot;
&quot; only on satellite images , the Fol@@ low season could be depic@@ ted . &quot;
the occasion for the attack was also un@@ resolved but the armies in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
&quot; and here , the picture emerge from the DR Congo again , as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre in 2.000 people took place two days to Paris .
you are not Charlie .
you are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ br@@ äu@@ er use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ tender ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all of these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass@@ acres .
&quot; still a step further bring personal comments such as this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to supply arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange also stood in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash message , published by the United Nations the ones who fl@@ ee could fl@@ ee , rape and various mess@@ enger , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported by the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following on which these descriptions brought together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture origin@@ ates from a su@@ di @-@ Arab news page , which was said in 2012 , President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein being said , mon@@ ks and politicians had participated in the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she used the image from the DR Congo to release this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last updated on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , the AF@@ P used as their source , were also mis@@ diagnosed Th@@ ein Being this statement , but had not been associated with the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false coupl@@ ings are rich until the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; reverse picture &quot; &quot; you can see how far more information can exceed . &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture search with the search@@ engine Tin@@ Eye has been found under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 344 images found that the said picture from the DR Congo are very similar .
&quot; they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private pages , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed false reports , others tried to dis@@ regard counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; we have examples of the ab@@ used exploitation and brought them in connection with the respective countries , based on which page they had been published . therefore , we want to be more evident than through the language alone . &quot;
from the countries listed below ( which were also associated with each other ) can be several examples of mis@@ used use .
here are some cases that can now be completely split up ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
&quot; examples of false coupl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo , with Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; the orange @-@ colored countries indicate pages or server , over the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ si@@ ders are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in Gr@@ ay are examples , which are according to met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also for@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; as a memory , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed to Alger@@ ian and interested Arabs ) as part of a threads to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

&quot; one side , the ru@@ mo@@ urs can be found , in question , that the said photo Christians shows , which were killed by Muslims . &quot;
&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this post a blo@@ gger from Quebec City not only identi@@ fies the mis@@ message , but also discussed the abuse of the image from the DR Congo related to Nigeria as well as further questions concerning the intensi@@ fication of the people and the faithful trag@@ e@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; &quot; Nigeria est@@ án quem@@ ando a los Cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Can@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , the district of the district is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
&quot; La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca c@@ ites its source to the Spanish news agency E@@ fe ( which is not known , whether the original report included the image ) . &quot;
France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contribution made after the mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , like this here , who used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; , have clearly seen no side like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that ref@@ utes this . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster ben@@ amed the faul@@ ty use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then by a post of the US @-@ American , anti @-@ Islamic comm@@ ent@@ ators in Pam@@ ela G@@ eller . &quot;

&quot; even within Nigeria the photo was shared by the DR Congo as evidence of bombar@@ d@@ ment of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in K@@ ano , in public discussion . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo , with one hand a twe@@ et , the sympathy against the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the alleg@@ ations , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya will be prosec@@ uted , since yet the photos of it were ab@@ used . &quot;
Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government released a jud@@ gement on what it came to be a &quot; inten@@ tional news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings in terms of Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this post@@ uring , which is exclusively published in English , also includes references to f@@ eit paintings , the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to set out that Muslims Budd@@ hist@@ s kill and ander@@ sr@@ um ( which often is spread by bur@@ mes@@ an nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , who directed themselves to the members of the Russian @-@ orthodo@@ x church , clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo does not show Muslims to kill the Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this news page asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein being in 2012 have been given that mon@@ ks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story with the image of S@@ ange together .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image continues to be included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 about students who were killed by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the Kath@@ e@@ oli@@ an An@@ ál@@ is@@ is Digital , expressly declares that the image does not origin@@ ate from the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; &quot; similar &quot; &quot; attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the picture later in connection with the mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to res@@ ist that there would be connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ j@@ ery@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ thin y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ uy &quot; ( Nigeria burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo emerged , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ has@@ ht@@ ag , and proceeds from Muslims after the mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal to Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities had these events , which took part in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was com@@ pressed as proof of the mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and over 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ ther ) . but the messages that were connected with so , were raised in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to focus attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media reporting , compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message which was supposed to have been written by a &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre , put it on discussion as this here on Vietnam@@ ese , and declared it to fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; from the message that was contained in the picture from the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; more confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;

frames and Images
there are two powerful issues or frames ( sub@@ mer@@ cies ) who draw these po@@ sts . the first frame foc@@ ussed on religion .
the photo was used in terms of greater discussion on silence in connection with the creators of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the creators of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second m@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life has been evaluated in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it &apos;s worth to examine how images can be used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe this pictures . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are many people who have inten@@ tional to share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; sug@@ ger@@ es this mood of mis@@ - and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tasted it the actual Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread @-@ wide pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that the with@@ hold of images of a ref@@ us@@ al occurs , the tragedy can be seen . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent pictures readers and audience des@@ en@@ si@@ ze and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media seem to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot regarding violent represent@@ ations to discuss in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; T@@ echn@@ ologist experim@@ ented because with algorithms , to support the fight against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; you will thoroughly think about situation where a picture suggests a bit , what actually can also dis@@ solved by the context or on completely ab@@ usive type . &quot;
&quot; however , each study has to be taken into account as internationally as internationally . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used in accordance with CC BY @-@ N@@ D 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ transl@@ atable ( e.g. D@@ t. uns@@ afe ) attempts to provide language learning a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are available in any language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these uns@@ ol@@ able words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese su@@ cks ) and others who are rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all contradic@@ tory are stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not sufficient , why a complete explanation and sometimes a context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Steven Bird , decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog one finds words from the VAT language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ bo you to hear your parents in recognition of how to make you endeav@@ or in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth that one feels after you have grown up in cold days in the sun . &quot;
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
&quot; they deci@@ de@@ ed other cultures , un@@ cover other puzzles and wake up our new@@ gi@@ er@@ de . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you can affect the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , and show more of this &quot; &quot; uns@@ ol@@ able &quot; words &quot; and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; , &quot; which are highly appreciated by Un@@ transl@@ ators are invited to highly upload their favorite things . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst Fl@@ ut@@ kat@@ disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst high @-@ water and ground@@ ing disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by mon@@ soon , which usually ends at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; following an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic center of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of men are missing because of the floods and fl@@ amm@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected by the last Friday ( 26 May ) , and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe place of residence . &quot;
the rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the water distances in some areas were slow .
health and hygien@@ ic proportions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the Fl@@ ut@@ kat@@ disaster :
high water in the Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water conditions of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates to the high water situation .
many use the has@@ ht@@ ag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lan@@ kan deadly floods wor@@ sen the den@@ ig@@ e@@ fi@@ eber@@ crisis , war@@ ns Save the Children , after further rain falls already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus in the flood , water stood up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle floo@@ ded because of the yesterday crossed water peg@@ s of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the air @-@ monkey has made five planes for b@@ ail@@ outs , and another five will be made for transportation of emergency supplies for which in their floo@@ ded villages were finished . &quot;
also various organizations and start @-@ ups have agreed to help .
Facebook @-@ pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ ana in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ asters Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high @-@ water situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue operations need for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
&quot; for all , dry foods and life @-@ needed goods for high @-@ water @-@ offering - &quot;
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this field help .
&quot; the tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people who share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ agus will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ sturb@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me brought a &quot; high @-@ water aid &quot; button to call it to users , a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then forwar@@ ded to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ cal r@@ ote cross . &quot;
&quot; also , they led a &quot; SOS &quot; key that had more than thousand requests and 150 successful ship@@ ret@@ ailer for high water and ground@@ ing people to follow . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and civilians of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , they bring residents in need in security and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further lives , with the population of Sri Lan@@ kan the long way to restoring norm@@ ality . &quot;

photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
use ic@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend .
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , they trust me their children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
in the one minute we call for Par@@ ole for women &apos;s rights .
in the next sk@@ andi@@ eren we rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are in a sea of rain@@ forest and people , some hold the i@@ kon@@ ic image of a woman with head@@ to@@ wel high , bound out of a American flag , other sk@@ andi@@ eren par@@ ables against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend look at me and says : &quot; these things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built themselves in their idea . &quot;
you ent@@ ail me .
there are 1.9 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practi@@ sing our religion differently .
&quot; we identify you to be Muslim , to different species but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim dra@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; this dra@@ wer is so well designed in our collective idea so well , that as soon as Muslims , which as I do not fit there , ent@@ ails . &quot;
to be de@@ mus@@ li@@ zed
I stand not alone .
&quot; this even happened to the poet , whose poetry is sold in America is : Rum@@ i . &quot;
what images do you come to mind when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a Orthodox pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western idea , religion is deleted Rum@@ is , as well as out of the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large proportion of the history of the 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the reduced images of Muslims that Western books have been colonial for centuries for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man who should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the survi@@ ving Palestinian @-@ American scientists Edward S@@ aid put the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these paintings continue to be continued .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continued to ban them . &quot;
&quot; I worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty scar@@ r@@ ative are domin@@ ating our news . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed reality , which has led nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v failed to realize that if French , Muslim women are forced to bear their head to@@ wel in public buildings and su@@ ction li@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women to discover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this powerful Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in American soil of Afri@@ cans , who were sent here with slave ships . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination for such deep and faul@@ ty that often si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and chic@@ ks .
&quot; because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
among the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative that help us understand the world .
&quot; and my industry is amazing to record the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
&quot; and we are here that seven million Muslims invested in the highest degree &quot; &quot; various &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one third of the whole Muslim population are African Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , coming from 77 countries . &quot;

use approved .
four decades ago my lon@@ ged parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid her first jewelry design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrapers of New York ; sky@@ scrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan wrote the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were in@@ um@@ wo@@ unds Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but now I am unhappy with Muslims and American ?
&quot; sometimes , if I ask people why I don &apos;t want to pick up a pig meat , I say - instead of my mus@@ li@@ ous recipes , or my hand@@ craft Sur@@ gery , who carry out all Muslims to wear - &quot; from respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I Scher@@ ze , we do not carry all the T@@ ash@@ y with us . &quot;
&quot; we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional safety standards at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who are trying to fight widespread lies over Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the running volume of a well @-@ founded Islam@@ ist machine , t@@ ink tanks and experts for Fal@@ sch@@ information which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them , there is Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a stran@@ ger who inter@@ fer@@ ing a woman the sc@@ arf . &quot;
or as the fri@@ ghtening map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below . &quot;
screens@@ hot of the AC@@ LU page .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms takes our affili@@ ation .
&quot; it attacks our identity that is so extensive , so versatile and multi @-@ lay@@ ered , that it can be impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer . &quot;

use approved .
I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was born then I was born in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when soci@@ ology describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ous faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend would see my neighbour , my neighbour , my rock in the fire that I am Muslims , if they could look through the 15 metre of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
she would see the om@@ ni@@ ce@@ ful ritual with my daughter when I put them in my arms and her the Arab verses to protect the Qur &apos;an and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them repeat three times .
&quot; please note that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil that one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ous faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; it is the image of it that I am seeing at this moment , when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by its full and un@@ finished paintings , a book with a lot of book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and four@@ teen chapters that can be virtually eliminated . &quot;
&quot; Muslims , to be the prayers to speak to speak to me when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims , how she brought me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , which God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that was founded over centuries - by a &quot; empire &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed , which has founded a company with the name Ehr@@ lich Bri@@ ini@@ dien company , has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with their grandfather .

&quot; belonging means to grow up and listen to that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my cri@@ ed grandfather wept . &quot;
&quot; spac@@ er , while he writes books on modern Islam and about independence K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , wept N@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ surrounded by his family in the India &apos;s dominated K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians whose families , like with my grandfather , by coloni@@ alists , who have shared the Muslim world like at stake risk . &quot;
Muslim ma means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans all have been coloni@@ zed to four Muslim countries .
&quot; it means to know that the first a@@ erial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected in front of a century over a Muslim country . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indo @-@ Bas@@ har al sub@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he was the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were air@@ planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was , and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means remember@@ ing that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were over every continent apart from the Antarc@@ tic , were distributed in Iraq to hunt the mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means that more than half a million Ir@@ aker are buried among the ruins of the war .
an American Muslim means to know that the self @-@ murder of Veter@@ ans has risen since 2001 by more than 32 percent .
&quot; it means to know that when a tragedy is seeking the US and bears a Muslim name , which tells the story four times more than a story with a white attacks . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four@@ teen years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , of a fre@@ el@@ ites black slaves called Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago , a African Islam@@ ist Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was reconc@@ iled and brought into this country . &quot;
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X name a US hero .
&quot; it is the warmth that I sen@@ sed , when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an . &quot;
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; a Americ@@ an@@ erin , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Br@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist means the in@@ dur@@ ated inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple bonds , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1,@@ 7 billion contains more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ eal , but is represented in the reduced branches &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother to be to care about my child , and all the Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people on this branch of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in Muslim registr@@ ations , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in constant monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it is in the immigration office , which takes a five year old child in Hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just the countries , which bom@@ bed it . &quot;
&quot; it is a false and neb@@ ul@@ ent &quot; no @-@ Fly list , &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims into the vision@@ ary . &quot;
there are the wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs we throw at Muslim countries .
&quot; because of the stories we tell , and due to those who we do not tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically un@@ correct picture and b@@ ates them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 on the evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the sli@@ gh@@ test score .

&quot; we stand for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous training prints , which we ste@@ ered in our news editorial actions . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our frequently with bin@@ s identi@@ ties and forget history . &quot;

&quot; but I am worried because of this difficult global time , where we are located . &quot;
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.@@ 7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason for the conspir@@ acies that existed in the dark places of the Internet , now the White House . &quot;
they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially because they have made Muslims among others .
&quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years previously , it had not yet been given ; now they master great areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;

initiative for narr@@ ator wants to keep urban diversity
&quot; tell , Flick@@ r @-@ User Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ N@@ D 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility here and now despite a language barrier to join someone in connection with someone ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the creator of stories in their original language a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported in particular about another initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ controlled blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the language diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities , ensuring diversity - safe spaces , in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to be . &quot;
&quot; listen to often is often linked to understand &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; the listening to appreciate , establish . &quot;
in this format I put her story first in their own language and translate them into English .
&quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , so perform their devotion and their representation that the audi@@ ences may be revealed . &quot;
they lau@@ gh laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ ale R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou are also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of the narrative art . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the beak of the rab@@ bit and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
&quot; after having declared the meaning of his beak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a broad grass , he shares his feeling of the inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have heard !
you were attentive ...
you were quite with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project , can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web@@ develop@@ er Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives are continuing the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions which he has made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s annual report : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on the digital culture , which is aligned in Berlin , devoted to an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the German resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of the book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective post@@ research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book that has been published last year and the license is available here , contains a number of performances that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers , researchers and authors who are involved in movements for free knowledge , have a side to look over the fog that surrounds our news and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and consolidated internet volunteers that have been det@@ ained since 15 March 2012 in Syria . &quot;
&quot; his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra @-@ prison , where he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
we do not have any information about his current state or location .
&quot; the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pushing for his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us will begin to reflect on their own fate , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we today ?
what have we decided ?
what have we given up in this process of time out of extreme beliefs ?
the Web@@ developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custo@@ dy for March 2012 in the custo@@ dy government authorities .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el from the A@@ dra @-@ prison , a non @-@ military establishment was transferred to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer of N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police force on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; signed command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported , she was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who spoke themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad &apos;s government , and they took note of an alleged deaths against their husband . &quot;
&quot; however , its location and condition remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , the Bass@@ el played a crucial role in which access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , T@@ echn@@ ologist and moment@@ ary the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , the Bass@@ el founded , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of the Bas@@ sels cultural prot@@ otypes present than the work that he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D @-@ artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross @-@ cross numerous civili@@ zations and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would certainly put it to this architecture that em@@ bo@@ dying not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this strip @-@ move into the digital ARCH@@ AE@@ O@@ LOG@@ Y and the conservation has created a time @-@ capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; typically , Bass@@ el could not yet conclude this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my whole life with them , dream of freedom to dream and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el brought me English , even when he was in custo@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read English well , to write and speak . &quot;
&quot; he always has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he taught other incar@@ nation , speak English , to write and speak . &quot;
&quot; Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me , both computers and smartphones . &quot;
he brought me the internet at .
&quot; he also brought other incar@@ nation , how they use computers , at least theoretically , without having actually stopped one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ bath that she wrote in the years 2012 till 2015 her husband , when he was in custo@@ dy . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura have worked together in the book for a year .
&quot; she turned the texts to him , when she visited him and he translated them from the Arab world . &quot;
the book is license @-@ free .
Buch@@ um@@ schlag by Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
&quot; it happens during each visit , &quot;
&quot; to fail in the world of your charming eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose sight on the moment , in which we embrace ourselves , &quot;
that each of the haz@@ ards is no matter
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and guar@@ dian &quot;
I forget the cr@@ ush of the prison
and I dr@@ inge in every detail of your voice and words
I carry myself with passion for me
when your eyes tell us
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
to fetch all the moments
and beyond your absence to cry and smile .
I survived myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :

&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ sels history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests of 2011 against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad &apos;s , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) more than 6@@ 5,000 people disappeared . &quot;
those who were arrested or killed under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; until 2016 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nest@@ y International have died in custo@@ dy for 2011 according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nest@@ y International at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in custo@@ dy . &quot;
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat today our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption em@@ it@@ ters Director after liability claims on the previous post
&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ ic@@ ans re@@ acted with wrath in a cor@@ rup@@ ting fall , in which a ruling member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , at which the corruption has been committed . &quot;
&quot; this is a Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , arrested in 2008 and 2010 together with four other def@@ endant of 54 million seas ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public scholars of the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , the Council of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately requested his re @-@ attitude to the company , which happened on April 19 , then . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General @-@ General Law@@ yers of the Republic , which was the application , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ b@@ aza , once again his old post as the company was not a discipl@@ in@@ ary process after its custo@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; however , many people are not happy to do the promotion . &quot;
&quot; the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , divided into an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company , the director again : &quot;
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a retreat with regard to the efforts of our legal system so the C@@ IP .
what we need to know is that the company would have to lead to a discipl@@ in@@ ary process against the rel@@ uc@@ tance .
&quot; the company apparently , however , and promp@@ ted no reasonable legal steps for applying the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behavior as well and considered the case as &quot; &quot; resistance &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza a competent guy would be , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and has half the half . &quot;
&quot; he could keep his lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and his image to be polished . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he acknowledged , into the company pur@@ pos@@ ing to be dispos@@ ed of which he helped damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will be gladly paid for his silence . &quot;
res@@ ists !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ic@@ ans and student of Political Sciences in Brazil says , the director has no moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state , because he didn &apos;t believe him , I cannot believe that someone in such a way is rewarded with the state that the state has already been so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ als to return and serve to serve the state * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead of being served only by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as hand@@ ele it has become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source and the state itself is tired , the pre @-@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind you that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , one cuts and - next to the proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral portr@@ ay@@ als was , as he confirmed energetic , that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , even the f@@ ather@@ land for his ambitions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he does not alter tactics but he does not apply from his ambitions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ambitious man is a criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also abl@@ ishing :
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down 10 years and came free . &quot;
&quot; and today he sets him the company , in which he was contaminated , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - About us ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017 &quot;
Em@@ ild@@ o Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( to dt . : @ truth ) establishes that crime in Moz@@ ambi@@ que pays off :

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and c@@ ens@@ ored many users to wrong
&quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ical word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ ell@@ b@@ se . &quot;
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network took their po@@ sts out of the net because they did the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook c@@ ens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or the &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; ( in bur@@ mes@@ an Scrip@@ tures ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma during the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ usive k@@ onn@@ ot@@ ation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort to fight H@@ ass@@ language in Myanmar , the company has a lot of po@@ int@@ ful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with racism , but the word itself is not automatically generated H@@ ass@@ language . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people reported that also Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about the use of its used , c@@ ens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with different mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ically also &apos;@@ Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; written , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( locker ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ used A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he enth@@ used the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends on spiritual nature , whether they knew how he could swe@@ ar his back pain by having a word of word . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ age@@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ically - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win is the opinion that she will reduce H@@ ass@@ language radi@@ cal@@ ist nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook analytical nuts , before it all Po@@ sts sol@@ dering , which are spread in suspic@@ ion . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it is fil@@ tered the word automatically .
automation will not understand what you write on fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should instead do is to analyse the post carefully and control it by checking the next words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( Sp@@ et@@ b@@ sen ) .
&quot; the good is that these three @-@ time nation@@ alists are spreading , the hate speech , a pretty good lesson . &quot;
it is now at the time to protect its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone , the h@@ edge @-@ language may spread , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of perc@@ ussion is often a k@@ atz@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are easy to start to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the word word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described , like Facebook began to clear his posts , when he only wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ex@@ iled from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was attentive to this new Directive on Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends , that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post from Facebook was removed and gave me the Li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the Post Office did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of po@@ sts of people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate radi@@ alist nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
mail without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done before the beginning of the initiative , for example the bur@@ ial Internet community to ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to decrease racism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cri@@ tici@@ ze such words becomes even more hat@@ red within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; her@@ sen@@ curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they didn &apos;t tried to correct the random@@ ly deleted Po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that give them a great turnover , this would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of much Sp@@ ott among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of H@@ ass@@ language to see if their po@@ sts are taken on the web . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts who were no H@@ ass@@ language , but still have been removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ical text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch the her@@ sen@@ curr@@ y and watch an Indian movie .
&quot; just to try out whether Facebook contains the post office , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screens@@ hot with permission .
&quot; the post &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
screens@@ hot with permission .
&quot; over the past five years , the extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used to have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , H@@ ass@@ language is to include power in social networks in Myanmar and in addition to heating , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been for his failure , to bring young people to his bur@@ gl@@ ean pages under control . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better on the context and on the code of concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trin@@ id@@ ad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is an end with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo of Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s to@@ e is now illeg@@ ally illegal in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament voted unanim@@ ously decided that this practice has to offer , so that the mor@@ dial age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; in front of this change of the sp@@ ouses , some members of Hin@@ doo and Muslim religious communities had joined forces in May 2016 . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leaders of the different religious groups of the country gathered , that the state did not mix the country since that , age does not determin@@ ate the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened in spite of the fact that Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago is a contract partner of the UN @-@ Kinder@@ Convention , the minority is defined as , every man under 18 years . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 percent , in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago 2,@@ 8 per cent , and with 18 they were 8,@@ 1 per cent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Statisti@@ cal Central Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online petition and social @-@ media movements , which stri@@ ves to cut laws on the children &apos;s to@@ e , followed at the foot and pleas@@ ing great support . undoubtedly helped them to bring this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du @-@ leader , e.g. had no concerns , the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should be dam@@ ned once again to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition sor@@ ting for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point came up if the opposition would not agree to the law . &quot;
&quot; but in the beginning of 2017 , the draft law was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of opposition and an independent , which did not include , so that he would be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
&quot; now , only the president of the country has to agree and declare the law . &quot;
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country announced on Facebook a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again posted :
&quot; Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill &apos;s throw against the children &apos;s age , was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no one against it . &quot;
&quot; once he was decided in the Senate , the draft can now become the law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users were thrilled because the laws were changed to the children &apos;s marriage .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who dressed an office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary bar@@ ge needed , which has vei@@ led the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s to@@ e is now illegal , and this is worth every price . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson the opinion was , it definitely was long enough to finish the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ fortunate that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which bes@@ ity : , , Out@@ standing news ! &quot;
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum age 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota that belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law is , noted : &quot;
the hei@@ ghted age in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious state of 18 years .
&quot; the draft amending the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es was today , decided on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members , and there were 35 in the voting . &quot;
&quot; all members , whom were opposed , have agreed for the law . &quot;
the children &apos;s to@@ e is legally no longer allowed in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ ag@@ ei@@ tor@@ y .
many thanks to all activists who have turned him out .
Con@@ gr@@ ats .
a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; but a possible hook comes in the form of satellite Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to undertake court steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to rede@@ em his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the General @-@ state @-@ lawyer Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supporters of the law , said it is quite legitimate , if Mahar@@ aj would go against the law , the most social media users would like to approach the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of keeping the discussion so generally speaking , in a way that we want to talk instead of the problem that the state , our daughters , our daughters to protect them are ab@@ used , would be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe it is not about a problem ?
&quot; however , if it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places around the world where children &apos;s face in different grad@@ ations are legal or continue to be the norm though there are laws they are under@@ going . &quot;

&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform created all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alised Peer @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator connections ) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult . &quot;
the content is in spite of legal ban but retri@@ ev@@ able .
in a blo@@ gger post IP@@ FS about his efforts :
&quot; once we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wikipedia.org itself . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS was also assumed that this step is independent of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no li@@ ve@@ - or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has a Mir@@ ror@@ page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar Mir@@ ror@@ pages if in the respective country Wikipedia is locked . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
there is no complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
&quot; one moves to another URL , which is not the original one . that which one sees then is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially the server controls the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia by yourself if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; for this is done by a server , which is not in Turkey . &quot;
a Ne@@ pal@@ es@@ ischer Wild@@ tier@@ og@@ raf uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature protection

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around you never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ ry with badly positioning things and well @-@ balanced colors .
the motiv@@ ates himself to wear a camera with yourself and try to walk the situation .
at that time he was still a kid .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , moved to the international scene at the age of 28 . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown directly next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct the attention to Nep@@ as wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how it helps him this first @-@ class position at his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wild photographer ! ! &quot;
I felt right at home when I suddenly joined Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my Father that would be a leop@@ ard on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the leop@@ ard was found and I immediately began to cr@@ ush pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to reg@@ ain global recognition for Nep@@ as Nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as sc@@ ary as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , because he stood up against tigers , from coun@@ ten@@ ance to face : &quot;
a tiger is unable to inter@@ fere with the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was at home because of darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of Bu@@ har@@ ks appeared . he immediately set up , we see ourselves and he stretched me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
to promote the protection of wild animals in Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I cli@@ ck for environmental protection ) on its photos .
but his passion for promoting Nep@@ as Nature and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; he waited 22 days long , and lived mostly in a tent to make at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he managed to photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , who live near tourist information . &quot;
see below some of these photos .

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ ona@@ az Kaly@@ m@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as a part of a Content @-@ Shar@@ ing Convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , there are women with great care to speak the names of their hus@@ bands or even from older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pr@@ ad@@ esh , women believe that they should respect the husband on account of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should be the norm to abuse this practice at life . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a sentence , and led by her family and the village of the community after they had raised a attached relative . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives is also not called by name , is also common among men . however , they have much less reli@@ ance to fear , if at all , they should not come . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , played nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , a unique club , and so quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone that they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and advocates the reduction of Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working with the help of their Vide@@ oc@@ am@@ era for seven years with the support of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS infected , and guides these clubs . &quot;
they reported how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and simultaneously have made them amb@@ ass@@ ing them at the same time .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini was shown in their discussion , was by women who do not name their sp@@ ouses . &quot;
&quot; she decided on this subject , because she wanted to open the conversation of the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify . &quot;
&quot; the name of their sp@@ ouses were not according to utter@@ ance , is a bre@@ wing that they all have to be maintained and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition att@@ ests that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not hold this , is considered to be rear as a woman without mor@@ als . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to have never named her husband in the name so far , when it &apos;s going to go home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion on her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; my mother @-@ in @-@ law , and my husband are hur@@ ting for a long time , after the video was at the end . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ ak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I am called him from now on his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage launched Roh@@ ini started their first discussion .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that there was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pr@@ ad@@ esh .
&quot; after the video proj@@ ections , the women were trying to bring discussion with an exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked any participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our sp@@ ouses , but they can call us how they want , meaning that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husband over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the Bre@@ chen of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in the married women never allowed to speak the name of their sp@@ ouses . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that they took only in the entire exercise ; another decided to settle all the whole frustration against him and his family by going him out . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ aline rush to have broken with an old bread , the women decided that they would actually try to go home their sp@@ ouses on behalf . &quot;
and they stopped their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in his head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member chose to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she died , she got fear and said that there was an error . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I am doing it . &quot;
a husband of an participant in was less intel@@ li@@ gible and the situation of art@@ ete in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the traction of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ ess red point if he was too . &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed only and I heard that to wear it .
&quot; the other women have not completely heard of them , but they mean , they are now in a better position to choose himself , not to wear it in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at any discussion . &quot;
&quot; normally , we pack lunch and water and go out into the field . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women worry about who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; for the first time they celebrated their own birthday with cakes , they danced and s@@ angen about things that they never had thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , but I also have some things such as our identi@@ ties to our sp@@ ouses have never been so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things to say , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have supported only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most is the okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ war @-@ Kur@@ ta , a broad shirt above a p@@ ants ; they did not stand out . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of dispute and discussion on the advantages of your own clothes , the morality linked to the Sar@@ is and much more , or@@ naments its own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things slowly come into roles : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then again heard on to say the name of their spouse . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it even , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
just one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now carrying Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the cerem@@ onial for more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a hard to navigate river .
&quot; giving each other self confidence , it will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explained :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . it will give a chain reaction when every woman goes home and told other people what we talk and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs have been taken .
&quot; two men have been arrested , and in consequence they conf@@ lic@@ ted that the organs of sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi is used . &quot;

it is the first time that consecutive attacks on gl@@ om@@ p@@ ent men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que were registered .
another group that is the purpose of sub@@ folders for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led this to investigate the UN 2016 in the South African country to investigate this internship .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of the southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country , where government campaigns developed to believe these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;

we are deeply affected by experiencing the death of our friend Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il .
&quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deep ou@@ tre@@ m@@ ity with his family , his friends and all those who knew him and loved it . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , took Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) a key role in making access to the Internet and Open Knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in our meeting arab@@ ic blo@@ gger .
&quot; in November 2015 Bas@@ har wife N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , she was contacted by persons who gave himself as a insi@@ der of the Assad government . &quot;
&quot; they reported that their man was sentenced to death , but no more information . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ sels stay and constitution were still unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , as N@@ oura of Syrian officials was arrested , that he was executed in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; today and in the future , we all prove the use of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the Open Web movement . &quot;
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations working for his release over the past five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the regime of Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad has disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people , thus the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
&quot; countless of those who were arrested by the regime , and disappeared by the regime , torture and even hin@@ ders are exposed . &quot;
&quot; between 2011 and 2016 no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans came to death , such as the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International . &quot;
the fate of many people more remains unknown .

a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia which was probably recently done .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be released within the framework of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the fall of the Indo Dis@@ pres@@ idents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community after its attorney at the end of June was announced that he has been delivered to hospital because of liver cancer in the end stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u sentenced to eleven years of prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( state aid ) , after being involved in the draft charter of the Charter 08 , a Mani@@ fes@@ to that had participated in the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China has referred to as an internal matter as &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; , &quot; he said it as &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this cause with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless China continues to receive views from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are fully exploited . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ arized several reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Representative of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ person will reject , to comment whether the United Nations should put pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad a treatment . &quot;
Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ing have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway gr@@ ated into the Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 came to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government promised that this ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon river to China , since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after having received the message that Li@@ u was seriously suffering , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for a unconditional release on an unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick its price in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his det@@ ention , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on July 6th , the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was promp@@ ted to free and allow his wife immediately from the house ar@@ rest and allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the leaders of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as they called in an explanation on 30 June . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect all the limitations of Mr Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet all visits and receive guests who wish them , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA ( USA )
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for treating abroad , insofar as it may help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Poll@@ ey , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June , that the message sent the Chinese authorities to liber@@ ate not only Li@@ u but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house ar@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the US message attracted a devast@@ ating response from China to itself , with the utter@@ ance of the foreign affairs , that &quot; no country have the right to take con@@ ical and un@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Poll@@ ey shared with that China should offer the following couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they are entitled to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mer@@ kl@@ ey and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to let Li@@ u and his wife uncondi@@ tionally . &quot;

&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; get all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters , that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u could over@@ lay the visit in Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the amb@@ assador Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called on to provide adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to provide himself from his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P previously , that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia might visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is Li@@ u not permitted , with someone outside , including its lawyers , speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells you further :
&quot; Canada calls on China to maintain its international human rights obligation , including free speech , to preserve and release the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France
&quot; France &apos;s Foreign Office called for China in an explanation on 29 June , Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments which he , regardless of where , required . moreover , his wife and his family have to contact him . &quot;
&quot; although the News@@ station France Info already reported that the French government of Li@@ u would welcome to welcome the State Department , there was no further information out whether France will eventually absor@@ b him . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of German affairs in Taiwan called on June 27 on June 27 , to release Li@@ u and challenge a greater tolerance of those who want to use peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ w@@ anese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu on the ruling Democratic Progressive Party requested China also to allow China to treat the sick , intellectual li@@ u to treat themselves in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in a statement on 28 June at Li@@ u very concerned and gave me that many have asked him to pray for li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives that he took and for which he had done strictly pun@@ ished , to a harmon@@ ious , stable and af@@ flu@@ ent of China , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and also encouraged : when I saw the hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or a country ?
&quot; the question may seem sil@@ ently , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state . &quot;
but according to the Minister of Minister K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am should be considered as a city .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ ggers .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branches of the An@@ wal@@ ts@@ kammer Association of the State of New York , the Ministers noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to other countries . &quot;
he support that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has questioned whether new York was a democracy ...
&quot; this is , with most people make a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Minister , &quot; &quot; the logic to rot@@ ate &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and effort , to create this valuable land , one hear that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the sem@@ bl@@ ance of a escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory injury . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , we@@ essen land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons behind Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of its , he appeared inev@@ itably . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he has defended the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York should be compared to equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democr@@ atically .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the topic , the good old Lei@@ er appears from author@@ itarian Mach@@ ines who pre@@ dict@@ ated democr@@ ats , since it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end of the final week of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am gave the answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answer . &quot;
corresponding questions tar@@ ded with non @-@ responses rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng demands Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clear his opinion since they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to sw@@ allow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country but a city is , so for what land belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ cour@@ g@@ am would take the effort to clarify this point where he was paid high , in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the blog his comment , he tells about the reviews that you should begin to read the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference , in order to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am better , according to which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the con@@ scription .
&quot; as he said that Singapore was more of a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore was so in@@ significant , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he in Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously does not believe in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am who is the leader of a her@@ ce @-@ growing generation to make such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; I am talking about what the Minister of Minister of Singapore has said , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expect to do with them or not , but this is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he really believes that he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review de@@ comp@@ lies the watch@@ points of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams obj@@ ections :
&quot; does Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; cou@@ ghing a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a fre@@ ud@@ der speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
if not what country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; since he plays an important role inside the cabin , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am is of serious significance . &quot;
&quot; why do they perform their military service , but they only defend their city , but not their country ? &quot;
whom must our Prime Minister invo@@ ices return ?
what is the value of our pink recruitment ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and always was a city : &quot;
&quot; I have not said , what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have many boundaries to be anno@@ yed ...
nobody ever told that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city - / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; defending the country especially &quot; &quot; etc . , but this is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
screens@@ hot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect on your home country or home country ?
&quot; your responses will be published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world being revealed and another fac@@ et will be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question which is put to me in Japan is : &quot; are you American ?
&quot; no , I am sorry , I answered . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live , and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation is held , it is considered pol@@ itely to show interest in his conversation , by providing personal questions . &quot;
&quot; then I usually follow the default response : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook perhaps in@@ war@@ dly ahead of anger when they are held for Americans , but don &apos;t distur@@ b me . &quot;
&quot; for anyone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans have a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack , if they travel . &quot;
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world - Donald Tru@@ mp , prior to the invasion of Iraq and the 11th of September . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small map@@ le blades in their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
with us there is no weapons !
gender mar@@ riages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
&quot; we are apparently very often &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is supposed to also be considered as the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I admired . &quot;
there would be nothing for me if one would change me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; first of all , as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means to be pointed out - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( which has its own Canadian twin ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem consists in that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing in which one can encounter . &quot;
harmless to be harmless to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting to make no attention .
&quot; this can be something good if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , remote from the things that happen to happen . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a major part of the Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what external standing as &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans are not often talking about the fence with neighbours .
&quot; we lack the warm , open kindness which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au then bet@@ ray the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our Prime Minister has made Canada straight sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has released a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ o@@ ert , which in 2014 restore the power and restore the civilian government , continue to be governed by the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the rules of him his girlfriend .
&quot; although not explicitly politically , the music @-@ video refers to the continued military domination of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video about the song was a great success .
&quot; within the first three days , the video was shared by Facebook 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activ@@ ating the public to look at this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction into the Thai policy , in@@ capable of how it beh@@ aves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
have a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political issues that have been pursuing Thailand over the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 Reg@@ ulations of girls &quot; could possibly refer to the dr@@ ak@@ onian section of 44 of the provisional constitution , which has given absolute national issues concerning key national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; &quot; setup change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are regarded by Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to ban activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit was set up in the army , monitored on the online content and individuals who were pre @-@ cast , the monarchy is persec@@ uted , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand sets a Stri@@ ke set against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ ä@@ ts@@ ei@@ unci@@ ation ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war in Thailand was founded in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to be prosec@@ uted , their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts have war@@ ned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax evasion . &quot;
&quot; in the video is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery car , before you enter into an inter@@ ni@@ sion camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they are supposed to have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and use Internet users , they should stop the monarchy . &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band showed the sal@@ ute from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; im@@ i@@ fied that has already been used by put@@ sch @-@ opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of the violin cities in Eastern Asia

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society recovered only very slowly in the East @-@ East Asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district . &quot;
&quot; more than 20 years have passed since the Georgian war has been officially completed , but his sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive images .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ Chil@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia . &quot;
&quot; ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , f@@ antasi@@ es , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and the Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russians live and waste in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called in ab@@ f@@ antasi@@ es also Gei@@ ster@@ cities .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people living in this ho@@ ist cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district 16.@@ 000 people since 2011 was barely raised over a decade . &quot;
in 1989 about 43.@@ 000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chen@@ kow@@ kas , are symbolic of the Dutch and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling and quite rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elderly man .
he begins a conversation and it falls hard to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still clear . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens , all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable glory buildings .
&quot; the people who once lived in this place , and their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have left the district meanwhile . &quot;
in the Gei@@ ster@@ town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chen@@ ow@@ kas , which are still one or two families , one can recognize in the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they move back immediately . &quot;
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us , that we have photographed to us , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she just has forbidden it to us , that is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed her girlfriend something to and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ si@@ sten@@ z@@ wirtschaft ( cultivation of agricultural products for the own needs ) such as cattle @-@ breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetables . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles in the winter for free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ chini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago an older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ m@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave before ab@@ f@@ antasi@@ es to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in f@@ antasi@@ es &quot; , &quot; she tells them . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial aid from her daughter and insist that they are instead supported their young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot;
T@@ ante G@@ alya tells you that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet up regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family , and I live in this building . &quot;
if holidays are we visit us .
but we cannot constantly do this - everyone is busy with their own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a , &quot; &quot; T@@ ante G@@ alya her to . &quot; &quot; they said , we could build Zu@@ c@@ chini . &quot;
I have already prepared the floor already .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ chini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as Talk with her husband and five common children lived in their house for some time .
Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old when war began .
every day she reminds of the village itself before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives , who live in central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ig@@ ma was just gone away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administr@@ ators in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but that will last something to do . &quot;
Nat@@ asch@@ a receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money for every child .
her husband works in the K@@ ohl@@ eng@@ ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten was once again , they hold pig , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;
&quot; it tells us that it was a very anxi@@ ous situation , when many people left the village after the war . &quot;
&quot; however , in the course of time it lost her ch@@ iness . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it is more likely to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly work and all lived like it was right .
I remember the same day as the city and the war once were .
&quot; when our conversation turns out to the end , a little boy has gone by us . &quot;
it runs through the windows of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy h@@ unted to him .
he plays with the ball that then stops the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them cast stones to the dec@@ ayed building . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood which care for in@@ consistency in their lives .
they do not know it differently .

in Mexico it houses &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants at their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org , and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; cross the way of migrants , the Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border with Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican , a small woman with a cor@@ als of a cor@@ als gl@@ itter and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy@@ mium @-@ shaped form . &quot;
&quot; it is named Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa . &quot;
&quot; this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian , who are on transit . &quot;
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with bl@@ asting , cru@@ m@@ ble walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are coming here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez , people tells people in full small buses and off the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on boxes . &quot;
it would like to refuse anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they bu@@ ys them medications that they can not pay them , they are massive them with a bal@@ sam made by the long journey exhausted . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is arrived in a short time . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ist ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
Foto : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her , since African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other directions from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the circuit , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells us that the Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ cans often talk together the route and that Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; as many of his companion , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer world championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy has been weak@@ ened , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest at Mama Africa since months : he sold SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money , to buy the B@@ usti@@ ble to Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I ask him if he will get in touch with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave it again , &quot; &quot; he smiling . &quot; we will always be in contact . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us that their guests are often sending text messages , when they went away to gr@@ ading them or to report her over the course of their journey . &quot;
they explained that their Christian faith in the drive of their work is .
&quot; they do not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare chickens as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only funk hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family migrants recorded in her small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has been determined that the B@@ usti@@ ckets on numerous African migrants are too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
at the moment there are 25 people mainly Hai@@ tian .
&quot; some sleeping on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
&quot; Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests do . &quot;
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install on their mobil@@ es a surveillance app .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter @-@ users with arm@@ aments from abroad .
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobil@@ es . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July , the mobile users received a phone notification in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the town of Uru@@ m@@ qi . in which she points to install the District government , a surveillance app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the press release , the app is said to prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities take the app to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were pre@@ fecture in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because it was shortly after they had installed the app , messages with a private @-@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app was able to determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ alo@@ u T@@ elec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block porno@@ graphic web pages , by online sc@@ am , tro@@ jan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to control your home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; of course , an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers may use the home network of a person to manipul@@ ate or to ste@@ al from it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to take control of digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports on digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China usually focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often d@@ ü@@ ster@@ er for those who live in remote , fri@@ ghtened ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit the rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme tick @-@ acids and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ ental internet l@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; this published on Twitter @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( in @-@ down ) , the zen@@ ed news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point , at the polic@@ emen , the residents op@@ tionally opened up as if they had the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian is sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; they have comp@@ elled the people forced to use devices that are intended for older people , to use . &quot;
this is a form of cap@@ tivity by the rest of strength technology .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( en @-@ down @-@ phase ) has also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ product description , from which the software can lift the password claim of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobil@@ es in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become an electronic hand@@ shake .
&quot; in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is possibly a reaction to the instructions of the City of Party , to minimize the dissem@@ ination of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all government agencies , authorities and with the party institutions including universities and research institutions are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office in operation of their computer and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report by Freedom House , an American Human Rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi , a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , till 1st of August their &quot; personal ID @-@ cards , mobil@@ es , external drives , portable HDDs , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; in local police to register . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obvious to identify any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; . however , this action is in@@ ju@@ red by the personality rights of the Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible prices , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : all sh@@ ew after death &quot;

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane signs his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at you and imagine that you are quite alone in one place where everything is yours . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually released , and revealed a truth that is clearly visible , both inside and from outside . &quot;
one who makes their name all glory .
one who has be@@ aten to a list of feelings and expres@@ sions those who do not allow a met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but if you get the reality again and you behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the performer - transform itself the characters in beings from flesh and blood , and everything shi@@ r@@ eit after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts solve themselves in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even though the earth is aware of the axis of the monster . you will clearly see that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone to build stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but this still doesn &apos;t mean , so I express my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the boss of the Security Service , it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he put his power over us under proof by having even destroyed the simpl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were cr@@ acks during a peaceful protests such as weed from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
so that the city over@@ worked the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all the districts of cov@@ eted , only my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was still , rainy , at the wrong time , even if I did not set high demands to a city that is op@@ ted to arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; during the third night , things had a little cal@@ med down after the power supply in the area to work . &quot;
&quot; I broke the silence by crying several times &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my house @-@ ach . &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a beautiful picture , which filled my expectations fully and fully filled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you become aware that you are free the spirit from the lamp , but it is not interested in the straight . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my Father : &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet at the military security office . &quot;
he put on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can lie down - nothing can give you your voice , after you have sent you all the way up to the office of the Security Service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ assan stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ assan starts to talk : &quot; let &apos;s listen to me how you &apos;re &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry out if we are not in the vicinity . &quot;
his h@@ edge @-@ filled eyes were on me .
&quot; and you are sad to look into the eyes , and not on the floor ! &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my door@@ way , van@@ ity ; perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so safe to me , when I rep@@ lied , &quot; I could not think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never stopped to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fat@@ eful consequences for me , and yet I am not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; it is in single , and his father equal to it . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal with this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fram@@ ank of this ver@@ flu@@ ent set is up to now in the nose .
&quot; he was exposed to a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture which I was exposed . &quot;
I inter@@ rupt the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
&quot; afterwards , through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the individual cells . &quot;
I read all details exactly before I super@@ vise the room .
otherwise they have probably shared a larger cell in this time .
&quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoners and must immediately put me immediately , without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I have access to an old proven communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; awakening . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me ultimately .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells there was a rep@@ utable man middle aged , which is similar to me and called &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness can be seen in me no mark@@ ers , and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all the responses are its existence .
perhaps he was laid in one of the major cells .
maybe he will immediately hear .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had insured me , they would release him when I stay . &quot;
Lü@@ ch .
&quot; I would like to have had a scar@@ ring , to s@@ laughter all these cranes that were lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I hear it still &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 am in the evening ; always at that time , the scre@@ ams , each day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the color of the dun@@ geon , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the Gre@@ ys in person : den Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; entitled to 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to be missed .
&quot; this was the secret to protect us to protect the state of state and to prevent the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al map , and desp@@ ised the narrow eye @-@ field of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is here is no land ; it is a cur@@ se to call it co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I super@@ vise the audi@@ ences and faithful to Abu I@@ mad , a slim and com@@ bs man ; at least he comes to me so . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , &quot; despite the face expres@@ sions , which are ent@@ angl@@ ed : &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can close as much more wich@@ es with your life than you can join this day and protest on demonstrations anyway . &quot;
I did not rep@@ lied .
I used it acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to reply .
I really cannot say more exactly when ins@@ ults and be@@ ats after a friendly talk for me to become an ordinary means of communication .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me told me that I had to be able to get pun@@ ished , even though I had done nothing to earn these punishment . &quot;
at punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fes@@ sion . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the clo@@ ister .
your Hen@@ ker takes you to your scre@@ ams .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot hold your writing . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams did not fell enough , so why they re@@ plac@@ ements the pipe by a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first time , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked earlier as a gar@@ bage dump or if that belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cable in@@ different to present ourselves , to present ourselves from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour , three of them rarely occur , while I was still on the line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling , and found no favor at all , which is why he loaded as a neighbour to an electric up@@ loaded . &quot;
flow through my whole body enough to feed my entire quarter .
&quot; my semi @-@ heart@@ ed body , the out@@ stretched on the ground was the perfect power leader . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must be as early as midnight .
I decided to sleep myself again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours left me like minutes before .
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of a deci@@ ph@@ ant youths : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father has to worry fear@@ ful worries . &quot;
&quot; be silent and gone out , you will be laid . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always left me out .
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b re@@ speak about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the bulk of his time inside , he turns to his canvas , time to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but what you can leave , is a cigarette between his fingers or its with ni@@ cot@@ ine ac@@ ulate lips . &quot;
&quot; he lives on the top of his family house , which had been part of them in 1967 ; the year , in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family , who lived from her village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who poses itself the conservative majority , and asks her old opinions about gender roles , sexuality and free speech by art and rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , often coinci@@ des with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees . all of these subjects do not only challenge in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ anz , but also in cities that vary from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as anyone who is not restricted in his thinking , and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not open it openly , he turns against the American foreign policy a special dis@@ incl@@ ination . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b believes that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas , something like to do with his identity as &quot; &quot; Palestinian refugees &quot; &quot; - so he was born in Jordan , even if he was born in Jordan and never in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I do not think of my own life conditions , &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a human being , while in water sol@@ dered Nes@@ café into two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan . during this time it is planned for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ ic law also conf@@ uses that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on an sen@@ ing hot young ag has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the gap of warm coffee and the sw@@ ades of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose is primarily of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you thro@@ ws a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it simply avo@@ ids to do fundamental things - as in the public during the Ram@@ adan water - to not land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Federal Ministry of Jord@@ an@@ iens has given an appearance of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic action front - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of Muslim Br@@ otherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual fron@@ ts@@ k@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , the cultural and traditional norms of the country is contradic@@ ted and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
the members and former pres@@ idents in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was said &apos; just &apos; because of the sexual orientation of the sc@@ ary .
&quot; many also claim , the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the old approved legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la das j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; &quot; who continue to stand up for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement may be probably not simply sei@@ zing rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually reflect a more evident cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan , which is clearly reflected in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs work . &quot;
&quot; in the year 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional sex sk@@ ies too Lei@@ be , having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have imagined sex . &quot;
&quot; the image shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of an apparently crus@@ hed un@@ familiar woman , their arms and legs to stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red sea , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , Jordan has gained the number of &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; human Rights Watch therefore reached its peak since the number of Hon@@ ors in 2016 . however , it still appears that Jordan , the institutional infrastructure is lacking to support the women , the victims tried Mor@@ es or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on dis@@ rup@@ tions from the year 1954 women , who are exposed to the risk of internal violence , &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureaucr@@ atic effort as well as guarantee by the family that the woman is nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is known , even not before themes to retreat , which in its country long as tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b unden@@ i@@ able that his work is political , however , that he cannot separate his music , the full of explicit acceptance on sexuality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I was initiated in politics , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; lies the focus on poverty .
&quot; the list of songs , which are in the core of political , can be continued . &quot;
&quot; in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words , what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , heter@@ eter@@ o- or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noticed that barely anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were in strong c@@ ens@@ ored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ ic Onlin@@ e@@ Programme Ro@@ ya , to later notice that his comments were made from the context , distor@@ ted and his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but it was only a processed version , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als are not the Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who has remained in mind today thanks to its home@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks for himself : if Abu Nu@@ what was to work later on behalf of the pot@@ assi@@ um , in the eighth century openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ anian this not ? &quot;
&quot; the actual problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ asch@@ ite Kingdom , there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are being sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ anese news service took several former government members and members of the teacher association , with the reason they would have expressed themselves on comments in social media critical about the problems which coinci@@ ded with the deep in the land @-@ root . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs believe only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress has been constant and taking . Jordan has become a gig for him for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it is H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , printed and inner changes . he is sure that these changes are held from day to day at the heart of the j@@ ord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately dreams H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he not only dreams of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is going through music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , Stre@@ um@@ uni@@ tions and on artificial nature of the guided democr@@ acies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until as far as it is , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b res@@ hi@@ ves and thus also res@@ ist resistance . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these great , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; it is assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ lics and come from a period of time , in the armies from the west of Japan to the northeast mar@@ ched to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , into the kne@@ es . &quot;
we are at Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , that &apos;s why we have a great view . &quot;
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a common center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two months to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been looking for a long time again the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two ball@@ ots are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival the only True - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high sol@@ wag@@ ons was amazing .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story , for they help to promote Peru@@ vian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair of hair . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , located near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoke and illegal drugs are daily . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , has always led to more norm@@ alities into the experienced hands of hair@@ styles which can form these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , who go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , even has an annual event inspired , the competition of the hairdres@@ sers Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os , who has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts in order to show each other to show who from them can see the ec@@ cent@@ ric l@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to see young people to see their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice for training in the hair@@ style , which allows them to find work . &quot;
motiv@@ ates from this activity and the providing opportunities have do@@ zens of young people seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops prior to the meeting in March and reported about some of their achievements :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only professional school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution of &quot; &quot; lovemaking message &quot; &quot; to the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love @-@ smells to people whom we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel deli@@ ver@@ ted with affection . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired her to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ ci@@ li@@ ación ( letters for reconciliation ) to write young people to write guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare . &quot;
&quot; only in short , their country was part of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the guer@@ ri@@ lla war F@@ ARC ( English : revolutionary forces of Kolum@@ bi@@ ens ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; International was considered to be the under@@ signed of the peace agreement as such , that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos was received for its mer@@ its of the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; however , the Colom@@ bi@@ ans is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years , have been exposed to a war of war , and round the clock their weapons in itself , must be integrated into living as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in fear and in some cases deep hat@@ red towards guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , these now needs to take part in its ranks and support them when building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian will join and would have to help with the integration process .
&quot; and that is exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love @-@ message to former guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare in order to welcome them back in society . &quot;
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters that will then be transferred personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters of reconciliation was born on the world summit of Nobel Peace Prize , which was held in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there they had Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the possibility to speak short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; this stated that we love the people we love , writing the Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day of Love , but those who need much necessary . &quot;
&quot; he plane , he told him further , this year his love to share with people who needed most urgent commitment . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was to write songs full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC who will now find their place in society and to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; until now , within the framework of the campaign more than 2000 letters were collected . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities Columbus as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I never thought that someone would forgive .
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN in Cal@@ don@@ o region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo about the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Stiftung in the camp to bring the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC had set up , as they had done before , to take the orders of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they received no commands , but letters full of sub@@ missions of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between &quot; , &quot; told the political knowledge student , Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Govern@@ ors of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
having passed the letters led me a former fighters through the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa @-@ fighters .
&quot; when I live in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ ill@@ ers live ) in which I saw a guer@@ illa , who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I had fear , to address , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ ter , a deadly weapon in the thor@@ ny tube . &quot;
&quot; I said it anyway , and asked , &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I answered a letter that someone written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answered it . &quot; &quot; I suddenly went to tears the tears . &quot;
&quot; I turned him very solid , and set me next to the granite light . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was sorry , he was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighters , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had something else from life as war . joining the F@@ ARC , was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from hunger . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society there that is waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have only learned how I have to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the opening , students and a few leaders of the F@@ ARC came to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were raised up as already war and the F@@ ARC already existed in the dark .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC explained the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; many years , we have experienced how the social injustice through the state embr@@ aced the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this size order it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; these people have never found hearing , and no electoral law had to be found , and to recognize that people who have often seen as a monster , and even hate people who were turned through their lives and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does me sore . &quot;
&quot; but it com@@ for@@ ted me that all men - also those who killed and so much damage to us , and can give us a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the com@@ mander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian has been made that after the draft peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there are inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to grasp the weapons and protest for their rights . and that &apos;s also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we take the F@@ ARC now on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call on all the defen@@ ders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all those who dream of a land in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring victim , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosexu@@ als and que@@ er men who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with fri@@ ght , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months on the persecution of pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat that such as a D@@ amo@@ is worth , on the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only created by night . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who has shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q law in Ch@@ echn@@ ya is conquered by several months ago the international head@@ lines , after reports have been published , the dis@@ cour@@ ing , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic of them@@ ed . &quot;
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; they cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities ; the suspic@@ ious que@@ er men commemor@@ ate and they st@@ ained in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun st@@ ained .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny , and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since their childhood , she was sen@@ sed that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when they grow , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so they moved to Moscow . &quot;
after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ sch@@ enen was experienced by the ven@@ ience of her country@@ men , the hunt was opened to Sabrina . &quot;
it was out of fear for her life in the United States .
Sabrina : I worked as volunteers in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone is needed my help .
&quot; it was a familiar from Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife , which was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , made someone of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he mer@@ ges them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made by the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was there , a couple of shopping dates from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a men &apos;s voice , &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a set , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ ward the family , thou sh@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ unded at the end in the hospital again .
apparently some women had got everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had a ambulance .
I learned in the hospital I had two key@@ wo@@ unds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which hospitals have you been laid - in men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name dr@@ on ; but the doctor did stand and put me among the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his Bür@@ ot@@ door , I got it with the fear ; it was a Muslim world , an imperial name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he &apos;s respectful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
in the last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives .
&quot; the demanded , to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they had absur@@ dum@@ my demands : some told me , I had to prove it by the streets without through the roads , others , that I had not changed my gender at the official TV in Gros@@ ny , that I had not changed my sex that everything was only bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have Kör@@ b@@ chen@@ size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how has your family tries to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some older people spoke my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that not only your family , but the entire Republic has damaged . &quot;
&quot; we can not sti@@ r you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she laid a strike around the neck .
luckily the neighbors and rescue they came .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car with remo@@ vable window plates and a number plate with a 95 dr@@ auf .
&quot; once it happened for the third time , I was clear that there was a little lazy . &quot;
my human ri@@ ver@@ ler @-@ friends insp@@ ected the Num@@ mer@@ n@@ signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you flying ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for safety reasons , I will not want to give her name , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then happened somewhat un@@ belief . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SI@@ M card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it , without sign up , without notice , without notice , without anything . &quot;
I burst my old SI@@ M card and cast them into the gar@@ bage .
came to and chec@@ kl@@ ed to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stran@@ ger .
I tasted the SI@@ M card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother per W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you heat in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , in what hotel you do . you even know your room number . &quot;
only to prove to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : just with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about the gender equality , however , this is a tab@@ oos . &quot;
some traditional k@@ au@@ kas@@ hen@@ ish elements I still carry in me .
&quot; so much I wish , I want this se@@ ven@@ ous barrier , I can not overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we ch@@ atting with camera , I give me a effort to see how the person watch out of her past - thus to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sabrina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for the needed I used up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who had dinner one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ adan no man was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he closed a new wave . &quot;
most likely they are now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; so that my I , they probably invite relatives before , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end we demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; through blood Gen@@ ug@@ tu@@ tion . &quot;
OC Media : are now even pregnant for men in these secrecy ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says it was not very many .
&quot; if , then especially such that have no rich relatives , or those of their relatives have been dropped to place Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be det@@ ained to present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be converted , one will show their bodies on TV and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not just gone , but targeted to radi@@ cal@@ ism . &quot;
OC Media : is that now only a mut@@ ation or have you a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just had someone who was ar@@ rest for a and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard was grown .
there has been nothing new since them .
they simply have taken them .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; but until now , they were not presented as a band@@ its , so far there were no reports . we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why else could it not be allowed to shave these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I have carried my hair always long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had one Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known as I was living there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
&quot; from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia was originally wanted to lead us to the &quot; Civil ization &quot; , but finally brought us back into the St@@ one@@ age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the m@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were sho@@ cked ; I had dy@@ ed eyelashes ; wor@@ tu@@ b@@ je@@ ans and short t@@ ops .
the safety of the sh@@ aria has never war@@ ped me only a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met me like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and the whole city knew thereof ; they knew why men , young people , there they met . &quot;
we were never busy .
in the Che@@ chen language there is an expression : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that means : &quot; Sp@@ otte not about the un@@ happiness of another .
they often say it to children if that make themselves more of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed you are sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
they never put me bother@@ ed , never ge@@ j@@ agt and never be@@ aten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace break up ?
Sabrina : for a long time to Kad@@ y@@ row stood on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he started to speak on television on mor@@ als . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us , but above all the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel like people in the city began to change . &quot;
&quot; who had been weak@@ ened , and looked at once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I was able to feel like the situation in the Republic is rising steadily . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an active activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ up , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get eating species . &quot;
I have no c@@ ents for this .
I discovered these people myself when I swit@@ ched to the shelter .
I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : wear an Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is fine .
&quot; so is nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ sch@@ enen , who want to know you with foam before the mouth , that there is no gay people with them . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ est@@ aner have those who have the Cabal who have the Russians ; on the entire planet , there are them - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , therefore it is uncomfortable , so what to hear . &quot;
here are so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and fall during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think of transition identity to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of sensation to be precise , different living settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and do not as@@ ham@@ ed me for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m so personal here but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not so sad for this - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an unusual high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in self @-@ murder . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August backward the du@@ bi@@ ous situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he sh@@ ame@@ works for his own assistance , the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups , who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; on YouTube shared video , the moments held moments after which he had turned himself . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to delete the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could not do anything more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ ic@@ ide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists from place warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ ate , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab B@@ ani Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : these were all family @-@ makers who felt thanks to the persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ capable to feed their families and to meet a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which the majority of women living in Iran living in Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to argue with the native Arab population , to argue their livel@@ i@@ hoods . &quot;
&quot; in front of a century the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly aut@@ on@@ ome region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ monarchy took over power and took great effort to end up the ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran &apos;s oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most respected and valuable commercial areas for the Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy still develops slowly , and the native population gets only little of that wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ duc@@ tions . &quot;
the Iranian regime is denied the Ah@@ w@@ azi Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , water from Arab areas into the Persian areas where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are . &quot;
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region through dry damage and local agriculture as well as fish and palm @-@ trees industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi is now increased to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ OUR Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director of Co@@ operative , work and social welfare , mel@@ ted that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who completed a job , 55 % a further school ends and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit national resistance .
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethical discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ murder amongst the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z new ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot;
&quot; since functional and institutions do not pre@@ ach Arab labor force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi will be moved from access to work possibilities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit national resistance of young Arabs , and to force them to earn their livel@@ i@@ hood outside their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their suburbs and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the ancestors and to be put to be toler@@ ated as even the Arab name at the workplace are not toler@@ ated , because the speaking of the Arabic language or the wearing Arabic clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances which the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi must end@@ ure , hit human rights activ@@ ist alarm , before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is complex and taking note of it .
the main reason for su@@ ic@@ ide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ ic@@ ide is avoidable .

&quot; why I am not identifiable by femin@@ ism , even with the inter @-@ section &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
&quot; the following article is an over@@ worked version of the opinion , which was posted by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally posted on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions have been expressed . &quot;
you can be read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as an interactive femin@@ ists - with frustration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we are generally all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , women nowadays are still less money despite equal education than men . &quot;
that women are still under strict observation when it is about what to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards still make sure that women sooner or later come into a glorious ceiling , and that discrimination based on sex still moves through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware of me and known .
I am convinced of that and I drink double and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet , when I speak on skin colour , on racism , on black CIS women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ pora , if I have been mentioning the way we have physically , se@@ el@@ ic and verbal abuse , decide to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless , however , all agree that women - all women should come together to raise their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about it , that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence an institution@@ alised form of racial violence , which we are exposed to two black women . &quot;
&quot; or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and origin , earn less than white men and women . &quot;
that black girl and girls with a migration background of the school are referred to as white girl because of obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women are exposed to a higher risk with a migration background , domestic violence and violence in partnership with a migration background , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want to join all men , all the men and all men of any skin colour of the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot conc@@ eive myself as black woman , in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuse to consider injusti@@ ces in their mind that refer to both gender and the skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m exhausted and I will no longer fight for my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented spheres , which always rejected me and countless other black women and ever rejected . &quot;
&quot; sentenced to 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also wei@@ gh@@ ed me to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an un@@ human and margin@@ alised essence . &quot;
&quot; I wei@@ gh@@ ten me to join me group@@ ings , which also absor@@ bing through cultural ex@@ propri@@ ation of our customs and customs , to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to present white women the importance of overcoming skin colour and gender . for some of them continue to remain the significance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to bel@@ li@@ fy them of a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different herds a home and to prevent himself from the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; before , I get rid of myself full of the femin@@ ism and called me the motion of the w@@ om@@ an@@ ism , used for my dark@@ ish skin and my status as a woman , instead of bringing me a white femin@@ ist paradi@@ gm , which is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly that Inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; it is more important than ever before , that we will define black women after our own ideas and enter into the spheres which we have created for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ em , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how to restore ourselves ) that we can defend ourselves in this way and where the cultural , spiritual , physical , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered . &quot;
&quot; although some white and interactive femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after they read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in an wom@@ an@@ ist environment , I can raise black women and women of other cultures because in this paradi@@ gm of paradi@@ gm . &quot;
I will be recognized due to my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman as a part of this paradi@@ gm .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life neither passed neither nor ignored . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this contribution from To@@ dd Reu@@ ben was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reported in@@ special about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
within the framework of a Content @-@ sharing agreement this article will again be published here .
&quot; over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a particular concern by the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of the pollution in his church . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of stagn@@ ation , the pollution and the un@@ controll@@ able development , lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers - a subsidiary of Water@@ ke@@ eper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as local communities in sustainable use of natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a summ@@ arized the ur@@ gency and the importance of his work in a question : &quot; &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq , resident documentary fil@@ mer@@ in and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , produced , filmed and edited . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on the followed , little noted sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ oper@@ atively vide@@ ography and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques , with whose help oppressed communities , their stories can tell their way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and her difficult fight against violence

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ rd women ) , who reported on the threads of women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed for the protection of the affected people .
&quot; a police com@@ miss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , its Ex@@ partner who has become violent towards violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship was a little time passed and the police said , their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not do . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed due to abuse , the ak@@ ten@@ ant display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman moved their ad .
breaking the devil @-@ circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women are at all refund at all , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also dependent on the men which they mis@@ hes . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to admit victims of violence , to be victims of violence at all . &quot;
&quot; content and Statisti@@ cs 2 Un@@ visible mis@@ es and a legal system , which is nothing short of Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really mis@@ led , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researchers for geni@@ uses at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the numbers available are however alar@@ ming .
in 2015 at the District of Law@@ yers 9@@ 600 ads went on to domestic violence . at 70 % of which it was about violence against women .
86 % of the indicators in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 ads due to domestic violence among the peace courts . also here 86 % of the indicators came from women . &quot;
&quot; in the ads 40 % of women , that they were physically mis@@ ed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
but these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women of Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di are actually shown only a few of these crimes . &quot; &quot; on every woman who are not re@@ funded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic failure , 9 women , who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on every woman , which is re@@ funded because of physical failure , come up two women who do not do this , &quot; explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s genocide in Paraguay is not an own crimes , the law enforcement agencies can not be appropriate , how many women are mur@@ dered by their current or former partners . &quot;
these journalists stayed at least 12 cases of women &apos;s genocide in the country alone until August 2016 .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence through men . &quot;

&quot; invisible mis@@ es and a legal system , which is nothing under@@ takes . &quot;
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the fixed friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she did not want it , but then , then , however , it should be forever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos along with Carlos - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time , it carried the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognis@@ able : &quot;
I have never thought that I would have become victims of failure .
&quot; when I read it earlier , I thought that only women happened to be under@@ lined because they dec@@ eive themselves by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , they wrote contributions on Facebook where they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he used it isolated . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever raised the hand against them , and refused to conf@@ ess that its behavior was also a form of failure . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why did they leave this so long by Carlos and left him not earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain compli@@ city . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner they were suspic@@ ious . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
&quot; their wealthy partner , it finally managed to convince them that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as indicators in the authorities were without a result and also by their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it carried out a process against its former partners who developed into an in@@ estim@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach to lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but they are not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of missions is a way of contradictions and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , a bill was discussed under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Für@@ th ) . &quot;
this ha@@ ht@@ ag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
&quot; the original script of the law looks forward to explain and harder to pun@@ ish a stand@@ alone crime , as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; the law@@ ful text was altered in some points to also win the members for the law who feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which is currently forbidden in Paraguay , and be pun@@ ished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was intended to carry out the majority of ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) procedures that have to bear the victims of violence at present , if they just want to report and receive a secure accommodation to the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the law does not provide adequate financial resources for this purpose :
in Paraguay it is seen as a part of the human relationships .
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer viewed as a split . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , makes themselves guilty and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators will be prosec@@ uted . &quot;
we have to refund as long display until misery is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law has been altered . however , among other things , there was a passage of the law which the partners in cases of domestic violence was called for reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes are going apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor to attack his sacrifice .
&quot; the string of words &quot; &quot; gender &quot; , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law shall be considered as a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man a year after pro@@ hibition of a newspaper continued attack .
&quot; this website was locked due to a decision of the Information Ministry , is locked on the homepage of the bot@@ bot@@ enen newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage over corruption in the sult@@ an .
&quot; You@@ sef al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he was a one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and put in court , but later returned . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man is governed by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he had his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state of state . &quot;
&quot; since then he dressed , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important branches in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Secretary of Foreign Minister , Minister of Foreign Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the sult@@ ans is characterized by the per@@ sever@@ ent efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic secrets , public freedoms , including press freedom , including freedom of human rights , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and further activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematic and hin@@ ders citizens , also activ@@ ist to express their views on the public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions as well as offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure , and the imprisonment of three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its foundation in 2007 about corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until they were banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Editor in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 announced an article entitled &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties in hands of justice . &quot; in this , it was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused , judges of the Supreme Court to put pressure in O@@ man under pressure , to raise a judgment in an inheritance . &quot;
issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of justice .

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , it was transferred to Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Committee group , taken by the ISS on the special department and was arrested by the security department at his arrival . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS awarded the dep@@ uty @-@ chief editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who had acts as an editor @-@ in @-@ chief editor .
&quot; the newspaper was closed to un@@ certain times after the information was given the statement that &quot; &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way , including online , starting from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in Mas@@ kat took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison and ord@@ ained the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j both were condemned among other things because of the disorder of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state &quot; . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of infringement of a audience and found guilty for guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and money pen@@ alties in the amount of each 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a year @-@ year vocational training was conducted against the two journalists . &quot;
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison for a year of prison quarters of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after the use of a information network to spread material that could pose a threat to the public order .
&quot; for al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit was set in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollar ) and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the Ap@@ pe@@ al court spoke Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i at six months of prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 after the completion of his sixth sentence in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he moved his one @-@ year prison sentence .
&quot; the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information on , the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper sees itself as an attack by the om@@ anic government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Information Minister sent a statement on which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the information provided is personally another statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the ministers introduced another time against the decision of the appeal of appeal to the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in O@@ man in recent times the press freedom has been in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; for example , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspapers of the country , to place their operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare the comprehensive violation of the press freedom . &quot;
the Golf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and uncondi@@ tionally ;
&quot; 2 . a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can go back to their work ; &quot;
3 . freedom of the press in the country to protect and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ ender and journalists in O@@ man can ex@@ ert their ri@@ ghtful human rights work and without fear of precau@@ tions , including court bodies . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defence ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighboring countries by promoting the opinion of opinion and freedom , and to gather peac@@ efully , support and protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or 2016 in Zambia , figure takes place with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is an increasing area that addresses the most urgent need of the continent .
&quot; for the need on site medical research there are two reasons : for a lack of supply in global healthcare , many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have widespread impact in the poorest countries of Africa as elsewhere , and missing investments for the research of these diseases through the pharmaceutical firms are a big problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , when building own research capacity in Africa . a larger role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is director of the centr@@ al@@ ab@@ ors in the Centre for the investigation of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself participated in the HIV virus , before he decided to go home to support the sam@@ b@@ arian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ or discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media through this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work is on the use of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just got a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogen@@ s . &quot;
G@@ V : what are your opinion of important research themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there is no basic research . we only put solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers instead of being creators . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get , are often not well used in our environment and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
R@@ W : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or want to draw here because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have previously ?
&quot; R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
R@@ W : there are already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how large is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , where should they concentrate , and how can we support development ? &quot;
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; the social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa regarding Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; R@@ W : often there are the limited speed , things to do , and the start@@ up access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of availability information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : like &quot; open source &quot; seed manufacturers to change global food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton was bred in the USA for the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ res@@ ous , the first plant that has been cultivated by NASA @-@ A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space and consumed . &quot;
&quot; almost 20 years ago , Mor@@ tons work was put only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question how many sal@@ aries can get limits , borders . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use it for this reason . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green@@ tone or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past years more and more such patents have been registered to more plants such as grain or cart@@ ot@@ ten@@ ers . due to this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts are concerned for food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representatives of a mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , Mor@@ ton is still a salad , but he now needs longer since his work is getting more and more constraints . &quot;
&quot; it is , as would lie in a river a rock bro@@ w , around which I have to her@@ d@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; so we need to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; says . &quot; I think that this patents on sal@@ ads go too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they hold Court , no one can breed more of a new sal@@ ary , because all the features have already been patented and tried to extract those features that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and endeav@@ or to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also connected to a movement which is becoming ever bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
&quot; A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space station ISS made red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous in the &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; of station harv@@ ested and eaten . there will be tested , whether plants can be cultivated in the space . &quot;

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area , and not from the field of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; software , the alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot;
&quot; it was brought to life to ensure that some plant species and gene not be protected as intellectual property , and are permanently usable for plant bree@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , shortly Os@@ si , the US bree@@ ders can commit to it that others can freely use them freely . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed oil and buy it . &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; bre@@ eder simply allow others to breed their seeds , to breed so their own sorts , and it is not immediately utter@@ ing - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ ente or prescribed . &quot;
do@@ zens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
more prospects for prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ zed professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Os@@ si Board , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants as well as for environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to seed , it plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try , last not or only little by using seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg empha@@ sizes that the &quot; open source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants .

&quot; Os@@ si @-@ supporters argue that the future of food supplies is at risk , since the available geni@@ uses due to the always numerous intellectual property rights based on plant material , which is thus always limited available , un@@ flow . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in her doc@@ toral work with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ ot@@ ten@@ tious as intellectual property is protected , which makes it usable for plant bree@@ ders either not or only un@@ usable . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass @-@ built plants such as wheat is patented in even greater style than salad or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a Question of View
&quot; plants become so bred that they have targeted properties - from such , through which their tastes or colour improves up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bree@@ ders occur through more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently however necessary than ever , because the changing conditions due to climate change are much worse . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and also vital for mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four Gen@@ res and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States , the company is preparing for the preservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not contradi@@ ct that the other property of bre@@ eder other bree@@ ders , since &quot; patents and the protection of pesti@@ cides can promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow , as soon as the patent is ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
&quot; often , these instructions can help others to come with another method of the same result . &quot;
&quot; such protection means that innovation is not , but promotes it by being provided by the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees the different : 20 years to wait until a patent moves , are certainly no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for such a long time , to breed on plants that are adapted to the modified environmental conditions , one could have lost the struggle already . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton is however that genetic resources have always been a general , and they should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ eti@@ zed incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want to make farmers easier for farmers .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , Mor@@ ton is tied to the concept to pat@@ tern@@ ed in the plant : &quot; we did not really create the characteristics . &quot;
the plants form them out and as a bre@@ eder we are ultimately no cl@@ ue as the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Os@@ si sub@@ committee , there is still another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; &quot; who is a sor@@ ting , and also his own values in it . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ al , in which cultivation of cultivation her@@ bic@@ ide is needed , the breed in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is accurate . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving on international markets , but less than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , make it possible to survive the most smaller seed companies , even without patents , or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ ders Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in his breeding garden sal@@ ads .

&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder by the A@@ void of pesti@@ cides would be innovative : &quot; it looks like me with my efforts to produce new , stronger than businesses . &quot;
&quot; I need a constantly new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties within a few years ago , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; with a patent you are 20 years ago in competition , which makes it very nice to make it very nice . &quot;
&quot; although the US seem to be leading in the &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; Bre@@ eding , the concept spreads rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the centre for sustainable agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , &quot; which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . the center with farmers works together and helps them to breed new varieties that meet specific requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed and to sell their own .
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l works on an open source &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si &apos;s commitment to bre@@ eder in the European Union . &quot;
( regulations for the bre@@ eder differ from country to country because of the Os@@ si commitment is not simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 the executive powers of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent application , the patents on conventional plants permits . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is still no law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to implement the patent , and implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference to &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed systems , that the organization is currently a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year the official launch fall . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - publ@@ ishes a report that farmers have to come to seed , to feed and improve the seed policies to ensure a stable supply with foods . &quot;
&quot; in the report also the importance of a diverse , local supply is empha@@ sized for sustainable food systems - a connection , by the Lu@@ by by Os@@ si , that it will soon be able to recognise him soon . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has taken care of everything and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to make the people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the internet .
this time it was the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend of the 5th of August , the Egyptian government reported the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which has documented human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August , the network released an opinion on Facebook where it cri@@ tici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information &quot; &quot; despite this attack and the constitution by the authorities to defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I have never been so important to overcome these objectives , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I was confirmed , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I was confirmed , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I was confirmed , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I have never been so important to overcome the blocking and not to give it . we insist on to fulfill our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first con@@ zed website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities set out more than two months of 21 websites , the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ o @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and from Qatar &apos;s network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era &quot; due to the &quot; &quot; support of terrorism &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is also no access to the blog of the Kolum@@ ni@@ sts and Human Rights based Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada , no access in Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada uses his blog for the dissem@@ ination of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles which he does not appro@@ ve the web pages and media for them in Egypt .
&quot; now the blog , which he prepared to handle the cement apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider with which also Zi@@ adas blog is native , but on the other hand is more accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces , while he reported on the student protests and took a video like the police of physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article focuses primarily about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment expressed Zi@@ ada to the blocking by the government and reflect what this means for him :
&quot; the , blogs to lock is very old , however , has priority priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi . and even if the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded to convey to me the feeling of a concern ; One det@@ ention , a attempted murder , un@@ loading of the national Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I wrote not otherwise . in other words , my words have an influence , if only on a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post items to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ ster go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ay and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . these are technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented the blocking of vendors , by the trans@@ duc@@ ting of dormit@@ ories and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( VP@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages , the VP@@ N@@ s started . &quot;
&quot; such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filter , to which Egyptian users may have access . &quot;
&quot; the situation will additionally wor@@ sen that the cement decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis , with which they can advance the court against these actions . &quot;
now the question : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?

&quot; day for day newspapers newspapers throughout Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous post@@ cards . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school , &quot; &quot; Every@@ one second day becomes a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe smo@@ ked Ph@@ armacy with military weapons &quot; , &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Lu@@ ber@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the gar@@ ter 2017 reached the highest status for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian NGO organisation Global Justice called for even the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports such as these are daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least find the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; published for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August the editorial article &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which they announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city will now be published there .
the motives for their decision declared the newspaper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city on the world such as murder , smoking , sex , etc . all , which however happened by civil@@ ised standard , and which is only published in Rio &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of the newspaper , that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize the war .
&quot; in the same video a journalist of the newspaper , that there is according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , which are controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
in the editorial article writes the newspaper on :
&quot; it is aware that a war is dis@@ astro@@ us when it is distor@@ ted , even though it can be used , atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to dec@@ eive . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
would the designation &quot; war &quot; more than they benefit ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l argu@@ ed the journalist of Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , against the violence as &quot; War . &quot; this is their opinion of a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it fri@@ ghtened to account responsibility in the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in analysis of military operations in Rio themselves , - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education , and a historical and self @-@ counter@@ part of the public service . &quot;
to the memory : the State of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital .

&quot; according to the most violent place in Brazil , Cec@@ í@@ lia is false : &quot; &quot; 22 of 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest data available . &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .

&quot; on these security policy measures belonged to the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a Fav@@ ela by using a massive police plan and to become a unit permanent there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning this was actually a decrease of violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP has led to several reports on sliding and repres@@ sions against poor congreg@@ ations , which should protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under attack . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page presented by journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , where he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - the criteria for the &quot; Civil War . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war has also serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this calls for the state to use the means and ways that are typical for a war . this means the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and is an object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ als . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war or her , Fak@@ t is that the inhabitants of Fav@@ elas are still suffering in Rio . &quot;
&quot; one week it is now that the police have the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to enter the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities are suffering from brutal attacks and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories , a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation p@@ ax and the Forschungs@@ institu@@ t The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly strongly affected by the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the mass@@ acre of Assad regime has been practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , those of rebels have controlled controlled areas outside of Damascus under si@@ ege that led people to be reli@@ ed on local or through tun@@ nels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the years block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat has become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academ@@ ics , the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can have their own fung@@ al as &quot; &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , in Syria pl@@ anting foods and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their nutritional fulness makes it an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ating fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fought for three years to announce this project and de@@ pressing its relief that it is now more and more &quot; to famili@@ arity . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ ac@@ da , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge of the plant of fung@@ i , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have achieved over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12.@@ 700 , but will continue until Monday , den 04 . September 2017 , continuing donations to Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the fuel tank , locally produced fuel from plas@@ tik is used to provide generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; production &quot; from the regions of the region , before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small pilgrimage in a tub . as this managed , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; teacher @-@ farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project , and after another 3 months they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in the east of Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to bring people the mush@@ room breeding of various reasons &quot; : breach of Bel@@ ag@@ ation . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread of a culture of self @-@ suff@@ iciency , by eating remains ( like paper , tea , coffee shops , cart@@ on , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women , the home work . &quot;
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and exposure is visible . &quot;
we want our experience inspired to help people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts of the cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that took place in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ forty people died and approximately 70 became in@@ ju@@ red by the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led the government &apos;s last week of solidarity with victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the G@@ ali@@ zi@@ en in Spain where there were 4 t@@ aves .
&quot; it appreci@@ ates that there were more than 500 fire@@ breaks , which grew up in the northern and central regions of the country , reaching approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , in Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande a similar tragedy , where there was a bit of a similar tragedy by the fires of 64 deaths and more than 200 times . &quot;
&quot; according to the European For@@ es@@ monitoring system , which super@@ vised the forest @-@ surfaces by satellite recordings , are burned alone in Portugal approximately 50@@ 0.000 hectares of forest , a surface of the size of the District Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there is only in 4 districts no fire .

people asked why civil protection was not able to put the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João So@@ ver@@ al by the covenant of the farmers from Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; according to Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evac@@ u@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday they did this nowhere , there are fool@@ ish reports of open roads that were enclosed by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen as early as June , since the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , buil@@ ders are asked with a high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a broad proposal to the whale form , which had brought the government to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was reported by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law which means the applic@@ ability of case if the applic@@ ant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that all was built , &quot; introduces João Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made attention to that large areas with Eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees made of light fl@@ amm@@ able wood , as well as in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this species . &quot;
&quot; in addition to these problems , the website of civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as inhabitants sought or tried to contact it , offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that cat@@ ered the population with information : it uses its own civil protection data using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and inform@@ s the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer of João P@@ ina , in order to simplify the work of fire bri@@ g@@ ades and was decisive in this fat@@ eful weekend in October so that the servers agreed to the crash of the 40@@ 0,000 users who were persec@@ uted : thereby the site was more than half a million access . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; at one night in the autumn of 1994 , the Con@@ quest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years previously , a terrible civil war broke out between the different Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in groups , who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so was Afghanistan to become a country of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; just at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , which belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afgh@@ an istan for the last time with his family . &quot;
&quot; even though his mother did not say it at that time , she didn &apos;t know that she would no longer see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
in the morning the boy should break .
his un@@ cle would pick him pick him and bring him to the ste@@ ep@@ es .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the army of Haz@@ ara domin@@ ated party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat was just mur@@ dered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly vulnerable . &quot;
the Taliban came closer to their hat@@ red on the Haz@@ ara known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the land in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his flight A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again .
a few years he worked in a coher@@ ent . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left by his little reward , and went in Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and to@@ wing with mort@@ ar , the he@@ avier than he himself , in order to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was shaped by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; reminded A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty @-@ standing building on the job@@ site , on which we worked . &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we noted n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we do not rede@@ em at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af made his life without papers in Iran and made up for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; with the dangerous over@@ ride in the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck , and str@@ and@@ ete on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day meal . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a sort of second chance for distr@@ acted asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions , the asylum seek@@ ers are in the country , cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organisation of civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffering from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be shared after an entry centre , if they officially put an application for asylum - what can be moved after the registration of asylum . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so there is also A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; but his un@@ balanced lifestyle will help A@@ shar@@ af , to free themselves from these conditions soon . &quot;
&quot; after spending several years of working in the construction , A@@ shar@@ af made his entire savings into the establishment of a youth hostels in Venice . &quot;
&quot; this went so well , that he opened a second hostel after a while , and opened a be@@ lim@@ estone . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( English : &quot; behind vene@@ zi@@ an@@ ical luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; in 2017 , the film was awarded the Venice City Award , which was already awarded for the 24th time . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of Afghanistan was created by Afgh@@ ans , including cutting @-@ makers , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entre@@ pren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals are far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and the retail trade and aim to go back to the country which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I never forget my country , and I cannot live happy if I know that my people suffer . &quot;
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of the society and have to get the same possibilities as all others .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af lubric@@ ates also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can sell packaging and preser@@ v@@ ative techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end stand stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; Ne@@ ti@@ zen report : legislative bur@@ dens from Egypt allow break@@ down social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , since more than 900 days in custo@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ti@@ zen @-@ Report is an international snap@@ shot , the challenges , victories and upcoming trends in global internet . &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a draft law , which indicates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration in a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users would have to use to use the social networks within six months , within six months after successful leg@@ is@@ ness on the website of the authority under specification of their full name as well as its output number . &quot;
those who vers@@ ed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the discharge of a criminal payment .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty parliament members , is currently the legislative as well as the constitutional Committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; May , another dep@@ uty of the Parliament adopted a bill that would be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the presidency of the President or of a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under the Egyptian law , the interests of the President as well as national institutions is already criminal . under the legislative proposal , such an act would be ground@@ ed , however , with pris@@ es@@ - and money pen@@ alties , the legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this can make up to three years imprisonment for the contrac@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would be a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) which was arrested on 13 August 2013 , as he demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military put@@ sch , who led to the elected President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited as more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in jail at a Jur@@ ster@@ min . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postp@@ oned to the 20th of May because the pris@@ ons according to human rights groups have failed to bring the accused of the prison in the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ load of e.g. arms ownership , illeg@@ ally gathering , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal court in G@@ iza said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seating area on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ st@@ af@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly that were also arrested in the previously mentioned accus@@ ation , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
tun@@ nels activ@@ ates to sear@@ ched documents
May we spent Tunisi@@ an authorities six hours with the publishers of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was used mainly to a sear@@ ched Action Plan . poss@@ essed Plan comes from the President of the Republic to ensure the busin@@ ess@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali the corruption presented by dict@@ ators Am@@ nest@@ y if these are all uns@@ ur@@ ly preserved money .
&quot; the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , casts a light on how the pre@@ dominant plans to support the law situation . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia re@@ jects the nam@@ ing of his sources under specification of article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press field ; which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he stood at the District Court in Tunis on 09 . May as a witness in the case .
will China force the users of social media to present their credit card ?
&quot; according to new regulations for the information office of the State of the State of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need a permit before they write messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the regulations , the registration with the full recur@@ ring names will be required . &quot;
analy@@ st susp@@ ect that this should be achieved through the elimination of anonymous comments in entertainment within the social networks . it is now unclear how the authorities apply these rules .
Chinese power citizens have suggested in social media these rules are only selective in order to protect the journ@@ alism and its independence .
let &apos;s see then in &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ? &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
May 2009 state c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Russia has access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat to register in the state government as a &quot; organizer of the information common &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government introduces a list of online services that will allow the &quot; &quot; publication of the information &quot; . &quot; the law also allows the government to charge the removal of content and force them on request for suspension of user data . &quot;
&quot; among these websites , websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ p@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ ru@@ k and frag@@ rant other services . &quot;

&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication gave to the site was locked because it is a source of information source which collabor@@ ates with groups to create a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey is completely blocked by Turkey , in addition to among other countries , one of the few countries around the world , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;

&quot; after this week , the government of Britain is in the midst of targeted consultation with regard to increased monitoring powers , the internet service providers would force to monitor communications in real time and install b@@ aking programs to de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has cons@@ ulted with telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , however , has left other technology companies and the civilian population . &quot;
&quot; despite all , consultation will still be transferred to May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be passed on to the ministry . &quot;
