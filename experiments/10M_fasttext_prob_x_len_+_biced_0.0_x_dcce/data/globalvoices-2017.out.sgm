<seg id="1">"although I visited the US for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is exceptionally big.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, American authors read and operated his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly due to a American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered the murderical conspiracy of an oil magnates, who were the first federal court with judges who were his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free according to Method Man," I was, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, had my admiration for the US only."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," "America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting that you are always the one that you are, and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very dirty love cover about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his Engines.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops his opinion behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague put it, and explains openly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have reacted upon his statements and voted in weakness for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes which he won in the Republican preselection, was the highest number one ever reached from the party candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans, who support this bigons person, asked me?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters with the people that I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist program, people from all over the world took up a deep glitant man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also, Trumps Weltbelief is not associated with the Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity that I lived in Sandy Bahr who lived for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still adapts to the engagement of Kristi Kappl, who always helped with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues, to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me much in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those by them embodied values in depth my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump's path to the nominated Republican presidential election, they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 about 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of its contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump because they were either shared with racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the Trump-voters as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange people, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in another way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities will not be considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters have voted for Trump, because they want to gain control over a country, which she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they perhaps wanted to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with contempt on those who look differently."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(m.).: as much as" "stretch of the White against all the other ethnics"; "words from white in Anplatung on the White and whiplash, as it was the great Van Jones calling, exactly what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate American Ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is nonetheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you might have always like, America is also welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as his president, twice the son of a Kenianers, whose history, as he himself says, anywhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again on the ruin, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a laugh" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "no!" "the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" "answered them."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" "they called them and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"would someone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received an atmospheric and laugh-strong "NO."</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected. "</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son was like, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Country, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find any place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release happens as part of an agreement with Global Voices for shared use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was then known that this ship had already operated in liberated waters of illegal fishing, before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were raised about accordingly, and little gences to welcome a criminal-crusher of this type at its shores."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comers, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized rapidly against the ship. they refuse to lay one of their ports and refuse to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" Ursuddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply deny everything "," reminds Benedict Kiilu, a leader of the Kenyan fisheries Authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship and followed. "</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch the fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to liberia, due to pillage of fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, the criminal practices crossed and resources protects, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegale fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are next to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had driven the prime minister out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are equal and work together. they exchange information and are mutually exclusive where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is captured will be hidden today which is extremely difficult due to it. thus the illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"by intentional disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species should be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems will have harm, which have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were displaced by bureaucratic hurdles, with the information between individual countries, so does the actions happen in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"here, the individual countries can exchange with each other for example lists of existing licenses, news to digestive activities or details, which one noticed or experienced during a port speculation."</seg>
<seg id="113">"Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, if these are moving on the open seas, through satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible to mark the authorities to mark ships which fish in ban areas. also, such a suspicious driver can discover, such that a ship invites its fired fish to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the ideal case, such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence, where they were traveling and possibly, whether they have a criminal register."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, can refuse the adoption of such vessels in their ports. what does the ships will not sell their charge into their ports. and that they can even be forced for the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's then about considerable financial losses for the owners, which means the illegal fishing turn is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve", "says Per Erik Bergh, leader Director of NFDS Africa. latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the aforementioned platform was created to gain more estimated 20 million USD at lost sales, who lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of the illegal fishermen who penetrate into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna-fish farms, which attracts the region of commercial fishing from around the world. among these also illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"among other things, these actions include like sailing under false flag, counterfeit licensing, the fish protected species and fish in nature conservation areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" you specifically use the lack of international cooperation and make sure the weaknesses of a non-complete control system use "," says Long. "" earlier a ship could be illegally fish and a country could then say 'You won't join my port. "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and exactly this legale Schlupch tries FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front operates.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspects ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has been criminal networks exposed, the counterfake licenses used in Tanzania. it discovered vessels which used several fraudulical identities and it has tracked ships and found whispered ships."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the International Authority on combating crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across great distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"it builds a system, the FISH-i is to help, digested ships precise."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"Fish-i's satellite system that will always be developed further, helping us hide the illegal ships who likes to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships turn off for example its automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be harvested by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps to build a system that connects various information levels. it should help FISH-i help to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A Modellbau</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team African nations can actually affect the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed by means of the position of every single vertraceable ship."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - this is simply sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this on a global level. "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system will allow the persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only feel criminals, but also scary."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships, which were used earlier without a license and hardly to reckoned with consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats have more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped, Greko 1, found the inspection there on board towed, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice this success." "the effect is so strong that us now also copy other countries", "says Kiilu." "we are a academic objective." "in West Africa disappear several hundred million dollars by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there are six countries assembled in 2015, to the so called West Africa Task Force. also they are now fighting the illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model like FISH-i." "With certainty the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently FISH-i's youngest members of Somalia report on his first major triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship which was under falter flag. and not only was the ship used without a license and were used to tow, which is now banned."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated in ban waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the Take of measures against Greko 1 put it a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans really works throughout the cosmos. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. there, it writes on environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to overset, one needs two important features: passive voice skills to understand the starting text and transfer an active language skills to transfer him into the target language."</seg>

<seg id="379">This should be a French native language for example from English to French - not from French to German.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies employ not employ co-workers with English as a native language, which might be translation into English. this may be attributable to lack of understanding, quotations or the relatively small number of English speakers that can learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have foreign employees, the translations are still pre-oriented internally. then the Japanese staff will be applied to the translators, no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the worrens and mysterious propositions which are created by machine translation, show that this technique can not replace a long life translator for a long time. this applies to several languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the most strange English phrasings in Japan, including the mysterious record-prints, which often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>

<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring villages of Fukushima and Iwasian were forced out because the tsunami had disappear whole coastal towns of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, the prefecture of Fukushima a nuclear accident had already had to leave their houses for more than 160 000 inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from local point of view the progress made for six years later to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and survey results of those affected itself.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Ivate"</seg>

<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected precontours</seg>
<seg id="560">"how the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by evil until December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of schools of the three prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefecture is far more difficult."</seg>

<seg id="564">"Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Ivate and less than 50 percent destroyed Ackerland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear war, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of breakable arable land of Fukushima, are located in the" nuclear zone zone. "</seg>

<seg id="576">In her edition to the anniversary of the earthquake the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has focused their attention also on the situation of evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, disastrous, atomic disorder, the Japan ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima almost 63 000 people were raised in areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23 000 people came back to Fukushima, in permanent spare parts."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the booth of 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>

<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour has been preparing mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centers, to help youth groups of songwriting, recording, audio- and video-producing and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the Pedagogues David Hodges that lives in Montreal and worked in north-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop is increasing that the young participants in talks are like" cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptance or whatever comes in mind. "</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells for example the history of the Highway 16, also" Highway of the tears, "in which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>

<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in Indigenous languages, although the young people are not always aware of the languages of the First Nations language."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First nation have recorded, the Refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip Hop group that gave them a Strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan, the strophe is at your disposal, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:"</seg>

<seg id="720">The customers look at this plastic dishes and then decide whether to enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the tokioter district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small companies that make the German filmmakers Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga prior to more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usually that they are no longer stripped over to them. however, a new trend turns them today into showpiece cell accessories and other gadgets."</seg>

<seg id="735">"some cell phone and mobile phones allow you to manufacture your own artwork. in this case ikura or salmon is used, a popular Topping which is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"is there someone who would say," Wow, cool, now I can confuse my mobile phone with salmon? "</seg>
<seg id="738">I believe I will probably be the one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic courts may also assume a less appetizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members.</seg>

<seg id="750">"the reporting of drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa carton, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background."</seg>

<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind every bone, behind each bone radiators in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político is called the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" "with drug handel live"), which give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who grated in the fight between the criminal law enforcement authorities and cartels.

<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>

<seg id="772">Where are we supposed to get? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid of. we must show the international community, the interruptions and the state of the state."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in Central Mexican."</seg>

<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">"sometimes I feel the feeling as if I am the One who was shocked or sad. it works, like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body once."</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be valid or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She also writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year cousin thinks he wants Narco (English: drug retailer) if it is great. and it is also not normal that people listen to the" "heroism" "of offenders, if they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, this is what they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have happened so something."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories come to mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the insomnia of the human being is incredible to me, if the death of six people and the disappearances of 43 students in a neighbor to be justified by that they were"</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to speak that they are spared by such tragedies when they are not toured and silent.</seg>

<seg id="798">"I asked myself in this terrible days, whether wines would dissolve my profound feelings, but the answers is no, because I have forgotten how to cries. I must learn to live with pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: one of violence marked by violence.</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions on how: who takes care of the child of an missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous town of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>

<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he said to him that his mother disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">"but this was not the day when his childhood ended."</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood has been past two years earlier than just a few blocks from his home, the bloody Leiche of his father saw that was shot by armed men from a squirt car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>

<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the prosecutor 3103 Morde. this is equivalent to 8,5 Morden per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundred thousand stories that organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in view of always new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "" has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim consists of the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trading, which has tortured the country in the last four decades, in comprehensible manner.

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility here and now despite a language barrier to join someone in connection with someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the creator of stories in their original language a possible answer."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices reported in particular about another initiative by Steven Bird, the Uncontrolled blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS is not on the written but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the language diversity of large cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities, ensuring diversity - safe spaces, in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to be."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"listen to often is often linked to understand" "these events instead" "the listening to appreciate, establish."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format I put her story first in their own language and translate them into English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not professional storytellers, so perform their devotion and their representation that the audiences may be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They laugh laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows for example a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round the storytale Rassidatou are also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of the narrative art."</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network took their posts out of the net because they did the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective". ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or the" "Kalar" "(in burmesan Scriptures) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma during the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely abusive konnotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in the effort to fight Hasslanguage in Myanmar, the company has a lot of pointful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar 'may usually be associated with racism, but the word itself is not automatically generated Hasslanguage."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people reported that also Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about the use of its used, censored."</seg>

<seg id="1304">"Zin Win is the opinion that she will reduce Hasslanguage radicalist nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook analytical nuts, before it all Posts soldering, which are spread in suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation will not understand what you write on facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should instead do is to analyse the post carefully and control it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar PAE" (Spetbsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these three-time nationalists are spreading, the hate speech, a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">It is now at the time to protect its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone, the hedge-language may spread, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved that the censorship of percussion is often a katz- and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are easy to start to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the word word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described, like Facebook began to clear his posts, when he only wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' was exiled from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was attentive to this new Directive on Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends, that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post from Facebook was removed and gave me the Liken, post and parts of content for 24 hours, because the Post Office did not meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts of people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate radialist nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech: "</seg>

<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to decrease racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Criticize such words becomes even more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words like" "chair" or "hersencurry". ""</seg>

<seg id="1480">They reported how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and simultaneously have made them ambassing them at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini was shown in their discussion, was by women who do not name their spouses."</seg>
<seg id="1482">"she decided on this subject, because she wanted to open the conversation of the patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify."</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the name of their spouses were not according to utterance, is a brewing that they all have to be maintained and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition attests that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not hold this, is considered to be rear as a woman without morals."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini wanted to have never named her husband in the name so far, when it's going to go home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion on her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">"my mother-in-law, and my husband are hurting for a long time, after the video was at the end."</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I am called him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage launched Rohini started their first discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "never before. some believed that there was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projections, the women were trying to bring discussion with an exercise in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked any participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," If we cannot say the name of our spouses, but they can call us how they want, meaning that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husband over the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the Brechen of a centuries-old tradition, in the married women never allowed to speak the name of their spouses. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy, that they took only in the entire exercise; another decided to settle all the whole frustration against him and his family by going him out."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the adrenaline rush to have broken with an old bread, the women decided that they would actually try to go home their spouses on behalf."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they stopped their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in his head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member chose to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she died, she got fear and said that there was an error."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," Rohini said, I am doing it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of an participant in was less intelligible and the situation of artete in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the traction of the zinnoberred point on the forehead, which shows the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would carry the ziness red point if he was too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed only and I heard that to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely heard of them, but they mean, they are now in a better position to choose himself, not to wear it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip at any discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1520">"normally, we pack lunch and water and go out into the field."</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women worry about who could hear what could hear," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"for the first time they celebrated their own birthday with cakes, they danced and sangen about things that they never had thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years, but I also have some things such as our identities to our spouses have never been so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things to say, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have supported only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most is the okay, but some wanted a Salwar-Kurta, a broad shirt above a pants; they did not stand out."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of dispute and discussion on the advantages of your own clothes, the morality linked to the Saris and much more, ornaments its own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round, so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next they have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure to create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question, whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed, Rohini confirmed that things slowly come into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then again heard on to say the name of their spouse."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it even, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Just one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now carrying Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the ceremonial for more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a hard to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"giving each other self confidence, it will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. it will give a chain reaction when every woman goes home and told other people what we talk and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib respeak about the rights of the LGBTQ + community and freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the bulk of his time inside, he turns to his canvas, time to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"but what you can leave, is a cigarette between his fingers or its with nicotine aculate lips."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top of his family house, which had been part of them in 1967; the year, in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family, who lived from her village in Palestine in which they lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who poses itself the conservative majority, and asks her old opinions about gender roles, sexuality and free speech by art and rapmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, often coincides with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees. all of these subjects do not only challenge in his hometown Amman Relevanz, but also in cities that vary from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees itself as anyone who is not restricted in his thinking, and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not open it openly, he turns against the American foreign policy a special disinclination."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib believes that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas, something like to do with his identity as" "Palestinian refugees" "- so he was born in Jordan, even if he was born in Jordan and never in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think of my own life conditions," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a human being, while in water soldered Nescafé into two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan. during this time it is planned for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordic law also confuses that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on an sening hot young ag has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the gap of warm coffee and the swades of the Kent cigarette in the nose is primarily of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you throws a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it simply avoids to do fundamental things - as in the public during the Ramadan water - to not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Federal Ministry of Jordaniens has given an appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamic action front - the jordan branch of Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontskers Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country is contradicted and the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The members and former presidents in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was said 'just' because of the sexual orientation of the scary.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim, the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the old approved legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila das jordan people as" progressive supporter of human rights "" who continue to stand up for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement may be probably not simply seizing rhetoric, but actually reflect a more evident crystallized reality in Jordan, which is clearly reflected in Hdaibs work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in the year 2016 Hdaib traditional sex skies too Leibe, having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have imagined sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the image shows the skeleton of an apparently crushed unfamiliar woman, their arms and legs to stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red sea, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, Jordan has gained the number of" "honor" "in Jordan - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch therefore reached its peak since the number of Honors in 2016. however, it still appears that Jordan, the institutional infrastructure is lacking to support the women, the victims tried Mores or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on disruptions from the year 1954 women, who are exposed to the risk of internal violence," and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as guarantee by the family that the woman is nothing to happen. "</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is known, even not before themes to retreat, which in its country long as tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib undeniable that his work is political, however, that he cannot separate his music, the full of explicit acceptance on sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was initiated in politics," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed "" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity. "</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" lies the focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are in the core of political, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016 Hdaib released a song with the title" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words, what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, heteretero- or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that barely anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were in strong censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib led an interview for the popular jordic OnlineProgramme Roya, to later notice that his comments were made from the context, distorted and his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a processed version," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community, and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals are not the Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who has remained in mind today thanks to its homeoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks for himself: if Abu Nuwhat was to work later on behalf of the potassium, in the eighth century openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanian this not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the actual problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Haschite Kingdom, there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are being silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordanese news service took several former government members and members of the teacher association, with the reason they would have expressed themselves on comments in social media critical about the problems which coincided with the deep in the land-root."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the concert of Hdaibs believe only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress has been constant and taking. Jordan has become a gig for him for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it is Hdaib - consists of slow, printed and inner changes. he is sure that these changes are held from day to day at the heart of the jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately dreams Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he not only dreams of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is going through music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, Streumunitions and on artificial nature of the guided democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until as far as it is, Hdaib reshives and thus also resist resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the contribution of" "lovemaking message" "to the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love-smells to people whom we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel deliverted with affection."</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this is exactly the question of the two young Colombian activists from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspired her to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters for reconciliation) to write young people to write guerrilla warfare."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only in short, their country was part of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the guerrilla war FARC (English: revolutionary forces of Kolumbiens), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"International was considered to be the undersigned of the peace agreement as such, that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos was received for its merits of the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, the Colombians is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years, have been exposed to a war of war, and round the clock their weapons in itself, must be integrated into living as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, who had accustomed to life in fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla warfare, these now needs to take part in its ranks and support them when building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian will join and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that is exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love-message to former guerrilla warfare in order to welcome them back in society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters that will then be transferred personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters of reconciliation was born on the world summit of Nobel Peace Prize, which was held in February 2017 in Bogotá. there they had Leonardo and Cristian the possibility to speak short with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this stated that we love the people we love, writing the Valentine's Day of Love, but those who need much necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plane, he told him further, this year his love to share with people who needed most urgent commitment."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was to write songs full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC who will now find their place in society and to build up a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, within the framework of the campaign more than 2000 letters were collected."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities Columbus as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought that someone would forgive.</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN in Caldono region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo about the BogotArt Stiftung in the camp to bring the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC had set up, as they had done before, to take the orders of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no commands, but letters full of submissions of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between "," told the political knowledge student, Jiménez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governors of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience: "</seg>
<seg id="2208">Having passed the letters led me a former fighters through the camp of the Guerilla-fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I live in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerriillers live) in which I saw a guerilla, who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I had fear, to address, because beside him on the bed was a MGL-Granatter, a deadly weapon in the thorny tube."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I said it anyway, and asked," hello, what do they do? "he answered," I answered a letter that someone written to me. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answered it." "I suddenly went to tears the tears."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I turned him very solid, and set me next to the granite light."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry, he was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighters, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had something else from life as war. joining the FARC, was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from hunger." I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there that is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how I have to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the opening, students and a few leaders of the FARC came to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were raised up as already war and the FARC already existed in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC explained the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views over the peace process:" many years, we have experienced how the social injustice through the state embraced the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this size order it is worth to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"these people have never found hearing, and no electoral law had to be found, and to recognize that people who have often seen as a monster, and even hate people who were turned through their lives and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does me sore."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - also those who killed and so much damage to us, and can give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian has been made that after the draft peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there are inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to grasp the weapons and protest for their rights. and that's also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we take the FARC now on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call on all the defenders of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all those who dream of a land in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring victim, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then happened somewhat unbelief."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it, without sign up, without notice, without notice, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I burst my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came to and checkled to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I tasted the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother per WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't think about, you heat in security, just because you have left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, in what hotel you do. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about the gender equality, however, this is a taboos."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional kaukashenish elements I still carry in me.</seg>

<seg id="2319">"when we chatting with camera, I give me a effort to see how the person watch out of her past - thus to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends do, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I used up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who had dinner one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan no man was arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he closed a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now focus on family and relatives.</seg>

<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it was not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then especially such that have no rich relatives, or those of their relatives have been dropped to place Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be detained to present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be converted, one will show their bodies on TV and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not just gone, but targeted to radicalism."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that now only a mutation or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just had someone who was arrest for a and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"but until now, they were not presented as a bandits, so far there were no reports. we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>

<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the maria law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were shocked; I had dyed eyelashes; wortubjeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety of the sharia has never warped me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny, there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met me like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew thereof; they knew why men, young people, there they met."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never busy.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is an expression: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "Spotte not about the unhappiness of another.</seg>

<seg id="2439">They even put well-thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminist and why we are generally all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women nowadays are still less money despite equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it is about what to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social standards still make sure that women sooner or later come into a glorious ceiling, and that discrimination based on sex still moves through the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: like "open source" seed manufacturers to change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton was bred in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredresous, the first plant that has been cultivated by NASA-Astronauts in space and consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"almost 20 years ago, Mortons work was put only by its own ingenuity and the question how many salaries can get limits, borders."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for this reason."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or greentone or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past years more and more such patents have been registered to more plants such as grain or cartotteners. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts are concerned for food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representatives of a millennia of ancient tradition, Morton is still a salad, but he now needs longer since his work is getting more and more constraints."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as would lie in a river a rock brow, around which I have to herdelling."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we need to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," says. "I think that this patents on salads go too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they hold Court, no one can breed more of a new salary, because all the features have already been patented and tried to extract those features that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and endeavor to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also connected to a movement which is becoming ever bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">"Astronauts of the International Space station ISS made red Römersalat the Sorte Outredgeous in the" "greenhouse" "of station harvested and eaten. there will be tested, whether plants can be cultivated in the space."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area, and not from the field of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the open source Seed Initiative (initiative for" "Open-Source" "seed) can be inspired by the movement for free" "Open Source" "software, the alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was brought to life to ensure that some plant species and gene not be protected as intellectual property, and are permanently usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, shortly Ossi, the US breeders can commit to it that others can freely use them freely."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed oil and buy it." "open source" "breeder simply allow others to breed their seeds, to breed so their own sorts, and it is not immediately uttering - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patente or prescribed."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">More prospects for prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emerized professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Board, Jack Kloppenburg are control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants as well as for environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to seed, it plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try, last not or only little by using seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or syngenta and Bayer are to be announced on the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, as for example, in August and September 2016, we need to know that the way is bred on farm markets, should also know that the manner is bred as such vegetables is threatened."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritionist without seed-benevolence is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to providing others to their seeds, so that their action is to be patented, in contrast to seeds and plant breeding."</seg>

<seg id="2657">"Ossi-supporters argue that the future of food supplies is at risk, since the available geniuses due to the always numerous intellectual property rights based on plant material, which is thus always limited available, unflow."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral work with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartottentious as intellectual property is protected, which makes it usable for plant breeders either not or only unusable."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-built plants such as wheat is patented in even greater style than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of View</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants become so bred that they have targeted properties - from such, through which their tastes or colour improves up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders occur through more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently however necessary than ever, because the changing conditions due to climate change are much worse."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is generally important and also vital for monsantos activities. with a total of four Genres and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States, the company is preparing for the preservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it does not contradict that the other property of breeder other breeders, since" patents and the protection of pesticides can promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow, as soon as the patent is expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">"often, these instructions can help others to come with another method of the same result."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection means that innovation is not, but promotes it by being provided by the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the different: 20 years to wait until a patent moves, are certainly no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for such a long time, to breed on plants that are adapted to the modified environmental conditions, one could have lost the struggle already."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is however that genetic resources have always been a general, and they should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetized incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers easier for farmers.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will be impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton is tied to the concept to patterned in the plant:" we did not really create the characteristics. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them out and as a breeder we are ultimately no clue as the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi subcommittee, there is still another important aspect of plant breeding:" "who is a sorting, and also his own values in it."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with large courtyards and monocultural, in which cultivation of cultivation herbicide is needed, the breed in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is accurate. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that are moving on international markets, but less than e.g. Monsanto are) patents, make it possible to survive the most smaller seed companies, even without patents, or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding garden salads.</seg>

<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeder by the Avoid of pesticides would be innovative:" it looks like me with my efforts to produce new, stronger than businesses. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need a constantly new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties within a few years ago," says it. "" with a patent you are 20 years ago in competition, which makes it very nice to make it very nice. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seem to be leading in the" "Open Source" "Breeding, the concept spreads rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the centre for sustainable agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, "which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, a" open source "seed programme. the center with farmers works together and helps them to breed new varieties that meet specific requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seed and to sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol works on an open source" "Open Source" "license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi's commitment to breeder in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for the breeder differ from country to country because of the Ossi commitment is not simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016 the executive powers of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventional plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European patent application, the patents on conventional plants permits."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is still no law; it is now on the governments of the Member States to implement the patent, and implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference to" open source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the" "Open Source" "seed movement and the global trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
