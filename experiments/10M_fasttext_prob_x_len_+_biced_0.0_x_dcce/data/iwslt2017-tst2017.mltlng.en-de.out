this is James R@@ isen .
they may know him because he won as a New York Times @-@ Repor@@ ter the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
&quot; before any one had heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he has published spectacular that the N@@ SA is illegal phones of Americans . &quot;
&quot; but it is another chapter , which should leave an extended impression . &quot;
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA was literally over to Iran for a nuclear bom@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if the crazy sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not fall into the chapter ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has been determined against R@@ isen and promp@@ ted him to call him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol of the pattern of government , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers to condemn and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the first Constitutional Treaty , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the patterns that they do . &quot;
&quot; so when the government came with R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous re@@ por@@ ters already did before him : he refused , and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , something extraordinary something extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they were years of indications that it would be crucial for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to R@@ isen . &quot;
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ter and sources are becoming less hide .
&quot; instead of fail and to bring reven@@ ge to the statements , that could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ator , without his consent , his phone @-@ wise geh@@ eim , &quot;
&quot; just as his email data , financial and banking information , his credit card , and even irrit@@ ation with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA @-@ w@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers and cr@@ acks . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is just one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama spoke to his acts , to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers . but instead , the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of that a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the initial Constitutional Court , because the government has always has more possibilities to sp@@ ose all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; while at the moment they can get in touch with the moment , rather than in the after@@ ward , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that had not yet been written as R@@ isen his book , and it is much safer than regular e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source head@@ ache system for whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the website , which was developed by us Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation which I have been developed , further developed . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post here . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents directly or send information , just like with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
these are encrypted and stored on a server which only has the respective news agency .
&quot; so the government can no longer make information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would request , would not be available from advance . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately governments around the world develop new es@@ pi@@ on@@ ag@@ et@@ ery technologies , which put us all at risk . &quot;
&quot; it is to us to ensure that not only technology den@@ omin@@ ator , such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to den@@ oun@@ ce offen@@ ders . it is just as important that we protect the next whale @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; who want to report about ab@@ norm@@ alities during the care of soldiers , and to report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alarm is be@@ aten to the water of Fl@@ int . or a Wall@@ street insi@@ der , who war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies have not only been made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest Daten@@ l@@ eck of history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; , &quot; that Rei@@ che and powers have been hidden in tax hav@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to make an explanation . &#93; This week we were sent from news about a le@@ eck of 11 million documents which in Panama based law firm Mos@@ bags Fon@@ sec@@ a . &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies like Mos@@ bags Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say , &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , such as the whole system works , as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has come back .
&quot; also , there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ators B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad stamp @-@ companies in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous on the next release , and the next contained documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the p@@ lot of an agency gri@@ lled or a John @-@ gr@@ is@@ ham .
&quot; it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we handle what ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powers are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and do not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , streets . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few of them , their assets are to hide and res@@ trained -- something that we have been discussing and discussed for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people this whole world seems very conf@@ using , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ d@@ oll .
&quot; so you have a firm in another company , in another company , in another company , what makes it almost impossible to really understand who lies behind these prayers . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for criminal law and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what is matter . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US .
&quot; presum@@ ably because there were no prominent Americans now , which occurred in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle , after which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ quito Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data base from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have a lot more cases and examples see the connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information to specify less information to create a company than to get a libr@@ arian ID . &quot;
this kind of in@@ consistency in the US has allowed the employees of school@@ district to rip school children .
it has sc@@ ams to rip particularly an@@ random investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks .
how does that actually work ?
&quot; so , we sent a co@@ vert investig@@ ator at the offices of 13 An@@ wal@@ ts@@ firms in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ators gave himself as a afri@@ can Minister , who wanted to bring out some money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really sho@@ cked it really , that all right up to an attorney from our investig@@ ator proposals made how he could be transferred his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ ach@@ ments . none of these lawyers took us as an clients , and of course anyone was handed over to pass on money . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as a solo .
it is not about a single lawyer who has under@@ gone proposals made by our co@@ er@@ ted proposals .
&quot; it is not about a single peak of excellence , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we must change the rules in order to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound all very tr@@ üb@@ ingly , as if we could do nothing about it ; as if nothing ever have changed , as if it is always the rich and mighty one . &quot;
but as born Optim@@ ist I really see that a lot has begun to change .
&quot; in the last few years , we have seen precau@@ tions to more transparency , which affects the owners of firms . &quot;
&quot; the topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland . &quot;
&quot; since then , the EU is in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind firms in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind this .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a draft law in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , as a means is used to provide greater transparency in the United States and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who are angry when they see , how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ firms . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in business , which stand up and say : &quot; in@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians , who recognize the problem and campaign@@ ing for it , by laws this kind of in@@ consistency . &quot;
&quot; together , we can finish the in@@ transparent , which now allow this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering , finally finish . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , just as I almost kidn@@ apped , and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das would be . &quot;
&quot; one day after I had completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard . &quot;
a type in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
he was alone in the city and had just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you miss this night ? &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know it yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; Oh , Man ! &quot;
what can I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleep place now ?
&quot; but I did not come to know him again ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I will not kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have an air mat@@ tresses . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; ä@@ h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night , I was in bed , I rigi@@ d to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh Mann ! what did I have built myself there ? &quot;
a wilderness sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , on tenth of the bed , and my sleeping room closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the artwork which he had bought from me today , depends today in his classroom . he is now a teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my perspectives .
&quot; maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as stran@@ gers , actually friends who will only waited to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to host people on my air@@ mat@@ tresses , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air conditioning . &quot;
&quot; we make a time jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ edges , my ro@@ ommate moves and the rent will be increased . &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think , creativity can do it to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new fellow @-@ inhabitants Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I talked about how we could earn something about it . our apartment is offered to a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and green so called &quot; Air@@ mat@@ rat@@ ze and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mat@@ tresses on wooden floors .
they found it great and we too .
&quot; I &apos;m sure to decor@@ ate our cheese ham war@@ ks completely different , because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we were touring with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , star@@ red Brian and I went . &quot;
had we discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rent ?
things came into roles .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ata Br@@ arc@@ zy@@ k , joined us as developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether you could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented our Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a website dedicated to the people public images of their private rooms post , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind rooms , whose doors are closed when you visit . &quot;
&quot; over the internet , they can invite the wild people to stay in them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
&quot; however , they do not . &quot;
&quot; nobody who is still at comfort , would be investing in a shop that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we have all learnt as children that foreigners are dangerous .
if you have a problem you have on the things you can well . we could dis@@ integrate .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tik -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to dis@@ continued objects like objects , but now we wanted to create trust through design immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design achieve such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design trust ?
&quot; I would like to give you a co @-@ tasting , which degree of confidence we strive . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
type your un@@ matched mobile phone to your left seat .
&quot; this quietly p@@ flug of panic , which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door . &quot;
&quot; for the only thing , which is more personal than your mobile phone , is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your text , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the bl@@ amed cell phone of a foreig@@ ner in the hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
you can also feel most guests when they stay elsewhere .
&quot; for this reason , our company can exist . &quot;
&quot; just so , who has actually Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ? &quot;
could you tell us on Twitter that he resign@@ ed for the Office of the President ?
you can return the phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour would have been introduced once with his name ; if he says , wh@@ ence he comes , how his dog or his children are hot ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents who all say : &quot; he can really hold very well bl@@ amed wr@@ ys ! &quot;
how would you feel then if you would have to post your phone ?
because a well @-@ known feedback system strength@@ ens the confidence decisive .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
&quot; it was difficult for people to cut negative opinions . &quot;
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both hosts as well as guest had passed their findings , before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we studied with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are about age and home . &quot;
little surprisingly we trust the people most who are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social incur@@ sion .
exciting will be when you add the call of a person -- in our case by Be@@ ur@@ es@@ sm@@ ents .
&quot; if you have less than three command@@ ments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation with simil@@ arities .
the right design can therefore help us overcome some of our deep @-@ root preferences .
&quot; moreover , we learned that confidence is dependent on how much you are at price . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little about how for example &quot; &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you do not get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells us a lot , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- &quot; -- the request is also not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , for example &quot; &quot; T@@ olle &quot; &quot; in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can we create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces toward foreigners . &quot;
&quot; what we did not reck@@ oned , was the great amount of people who were more than willing to present these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
see how many people use our offer .
one can recognize three things .
&quot; firstly , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; thir@@ dly , a need that had not been covered before . &quot;
for us the business works very well .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have been allowed parties are celebrated or apartments vulnerable .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I have worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at the front , when confidence has been broken . &quot;
there is nothing Sch@@ lim@@ mer@@ it as these calls . it does already hurt when I just think about it .
&quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of c@@ aller , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves further . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , of the 123 million overnight stays only a fraction ever had a fraction ever . &quot;
for people trust each other rightly .
&quot; if confidence works , it may arise miracles . &quot;
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host was brought him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his jud@@ gement :
&quot; perfect house for travellers , which tend to be due to sitting activities to heart attack . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Al@@ ej@@ andra are real protective angel , who save a life , even though they don &apos;t know correctly . &quot;
&quot; they drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait , while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you feel lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
they can even stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay is running . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money @-@ trans@@ action is exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with cash transactions fit together ?
it is about economic trade .
&quot; but now it &apos;s simply to call &quot; &quot; rent industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
&quot; Share Economy describes a trade , human relationships promises . &quot;
people place a part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel today , this is compared to Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but for less authentic . &quot;
&quot; however , what would be when travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be ? &quot;
&quot; what if at any place , you would like to wait , a group of announ@@ cing it would wait to fill a thoroughly clean and one in a pub / area that one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are arranged according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to make apartments of reason for co @-@ operation ?
how would this look like ?
what would be if cities would have the thoughts of common sharing ?
I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and waste .
&quot; in Southern French capital Seoul , this project has already been started . many parking spaces , which were belonging to the government , &quot;
&quot; were now being offered residents . students who were looking for a lead , &quot;
&quot; people were convey@@ ed to people whose children were educated . there were inc@@ ub@@ ators , were started . &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . through our platform alone , night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest in a stran@@ ger or even hosts . &quot;
the idea does not seem to be crazy as it was brought to us .
we have not invented the wheel .
&quot; hospitality , there were also before . &quot;
there were already similar sites before us .
so why has it just done our works ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that one can find the right design with the components of the trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ root prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find this amaz@@ ingly , &quot;
straight to overwhelming .
I have to think about it if a red Maz@@ da goes over to me .
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I ask myself for what we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
perhaps even a sister .
&quot; or suppres@@ sed , a brain @-@ under@@ wear under@@ went a terrorist threat ? &quot;
or simply a delay in security on the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; thus , media people represent that look like me . &quot;
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably the people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim : it is great , you will meet . &quot;
I say to you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted .
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ar @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslims . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual person , as some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to carry the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head @-@ covering . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friends were kidn@@ apped , &quot; &quot; why do you lose yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the Lus@@ tige was : back then it was a femin@@ ist Declaration of Independence , and in contrast to the pressure which I felt as 17 year @-@ old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ parall@@ eled beauty . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have been with the Quran .
&quot; I read it , thought after , asked and believed in question . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dedication that can be deep@@ ened with each reading of the coral .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to the wines .
I realize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ving you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels like .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineering . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that horrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had at the end of the breakfast , I looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ at . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flo@@ cks in buildings , people p@@ ran@@ ged from the buildings . &quot;
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned into ou@@ trage quickly .
why should you do such a thing ?
&quot; I joined the television canal and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u transformed me the actions of others from a civil war in a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the US to move into a new city and begin with the study of integration . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as I drove -- as we silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time being feared as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we went out this night into our apartment , in a new city , where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; s@@ ells in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ mm@@ elt you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday at that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of this process .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who stopped for Muslims , into the free movement . &quot;
there was really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who had attacked this country to have attacked our country .
I cri@@ tici@@ zed the w@@ ut of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; nowadays , we can actually say guys : &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we go them ? &quot;
some people want to make Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak about my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it just raises the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
&quot; they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor , one is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our , only under observation . &quot;
the alternatives are useless because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims like all the other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a life @-@ important organ . &quot;
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olympi@@ oni@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
&quot; there may be some parking free of charge , but not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque is leading to view people other faith toler@@ ant , and to show greater citizens . &quot;
&quot; and as a head of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently said : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
&quot; when the radi@@ cal@@ alization process one has noticed that he begins online , even from her family so that the person believes that the person believes that the people believe the true Muslims , and anyone who desp@@ ises their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor , or from faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must keep people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still be claiming that Islam is a non @-@ violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes their brut@@ ality with the Quran . &quot;
&quot; as Muslims , as a mother , as a person , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; however , we would add to her imagination , if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u club @-@ club with Christianity .
&quot; both groups claim their ideology grounds on their &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but if one thro@@ ws a look at it , it is not driving what they are blo@@ wn in her &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding I@@ mam told me a amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because they hid themselves to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . each spiritual man had talked with whom she had spoken , she brought to silence , and said that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , they would only bring in trouble . &quot;
&quot; from nothing inspired and something that would have given their anger sense , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts that you spoke one solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam presented the connection to God and their church again .
&quot; instead of blame them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS . &quot;
it was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our thoughts ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear we happen at least three things .
&quot; we accept more an authorized governmental system , con@@ form@@ ance and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if you report testing news , in which negative about Muslims reported it was rather military attack on Muslim countries and the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
when you look when the mood against Muslims upwards - between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times but never happened in connection with the terrorist attacks .
it happened in the advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; thus , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation of the public in order to realise the foundation of a free society , the sensible and well informed citizens . &quot;
the handling of Muslims is an early War@@ n@@ marks .
&quot; we might feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear sh@@ ines us all . &quot;
&quot; in the assignment of coll@@ ectiv@@ ism , it is not just about to explain himself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both at school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; he was argu@@ ed at the dental faculty , talented , promising , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , generous , the man knew he knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazing and said :
when is out of my br@@ otherhood such a sealed young man ?
&quot; only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was mur@@ dered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an that was in the afternoon to visit . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution , after having posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he was just eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism is not only im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we poss@@ essed it and for us it was not easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove silent , with high pressure on the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , went to my shoes went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , left me . &quot;
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made an announcement , printed and called our guests , because half of the gathered together were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , A@@ thei@@ sts , believers , believers , believers , believers and non @-@ believers . &quot;
at this moment I have broken down .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be number safe ?
or will you connect to those who mean : we are better than the ones .
many thanks .
thanks nice !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have taken a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what you say that you might say that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk with dr@@ au@@ ght , a mind@@ set with dr@@ au@@ ght , so an exception and not the rule are . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say dec@@ eive you don &apos;t . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when one looks around the world around the world , and I did that with the largest ever performed study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
they want prosperity to the family ; they want to work and they want to live in peace .
&quot; so , I am not an exception in any respect . &quot;
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; as a platform for Bast@@ ler began , is just before to become a billion business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ package position in our social awareness , has a autonomous fleet of aviation machines in Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
inter@@ locking air devices reach high speed and acceler@@ ation on the narro@@ west space .
you can also build self @-@ constantly able structures .
&quot; they have learned to bear loads , to deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and in general react to natural legislation . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the limits of the Pos@@ sible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order to create a system autonomous , it needs to know the collective procurement where the mobile objects can be found . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynam@@ ical tas@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alized technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a off@@ springs of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level e . e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called h@@ eck@@ starter , &quot;
&quot; a flight device , which tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; like other star@@ r@@ ator , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helic@@ opter in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ r@@ ens it can vibr@@ ate , and thus has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of h@@ eck@@ ers is that they are sensitive to tur@@ mo@@ il like windsurfing .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the leaf@@ let doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often present fundamental abstract issues that lead to the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; such a question would be , for example : what is the smaller number of mo@@ ve@@ able parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons why you want to know the answer to such a question .
helic@@ opter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that work together to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained drivers were flying controlled air appliances , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate . &quot;
we discovered that flies with just one works .
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical , simpl@@ est remote device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it only has a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no valves , hin@@ ders and cross @-@ sections , no further actu@@ ator or contro@@ l@@ lo@@ id surfaces , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechanical simple , happens in the interior living very much so that it can fly stable and move into the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the rear star@@ ters . to get it to the flies , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ eli@@ hood , to throw it right if all watch , is small , therefore I show you a video that was filmed for yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in gen@@ esis , this machine is here , the bus @-@ head with his eight prop@@ ell@@ ors , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what do you do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ ri@@ cally balanced .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; thus , he will receive the proper capability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is filmed or even how it is rotating . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ell@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; some is conceivable in models , the rest will be learned directly at the subject . &quot;
let &apos;s see ourselves this .
&quot; if flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is composed of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ ellers machines .
this is reflected in the clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; if you build them , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or an accumul@@ ator can continue the machine even if limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate that by making a half plane .
the last demonstration examined synthetic heat .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took wholesale micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a sli@@ ce bread -- and provide it with local technology and algorithms .
&quot; every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no limit . &quot;
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine since it would like to be on Broadway a flying lamp .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us the sal@@ ary is in development and creation .
&quot; it serves as a memory , as wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures , to form them in so spectacular ways . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; in front of 1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant galax@@ y two black holes are getting faster , they turned down the mass of thre@@ es in a tenth of tens of energy . &quot;
this short moment sh@@ utt@@ led them bri@@ ghter than all the stars along with all the galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big boy .
but they did not put your energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time ge@@ oning itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we first arrange the events in the meantime . &quot;
in front 1.3 billion years ago it has been a poly@@ zel@@ liges life on Earth .
&quot; since then the earth has brought some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand with us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group was particularly cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- to look for a huge laser det@@ ector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational black holes . &quot;
most of them stopped for crazy .
&quot; but enough people realized it as crazy gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation was funded their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much har@@ ter work they built the Det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter@@ - Gravit@@ ation@@ shafts . &quot;
in the follow @-@ up time the precision of LI@@ GO could considerably increase what the performance capacity has improved .
so you call it Advanced LI@@ GO .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO was started to clarify a few smaller , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ zed black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the far@@ ewell of my to@@ ken Father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
all that which I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been examined for 23 years of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their by observ@@ at@@ ories like LI@@ GO measurable signals . what are the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ ursor in the space of space and time .
&quot; while temporary , the wave will become the space and its entire content into one direction is stretched and into the other . &quot;
&quot; at the show , lectur@@ ers in courses on the rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often lead a really al@@ ber@@ ing dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each one of us was stretched with the waves of the waves and pun@@ ched . the stretching of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 N@@ ul@@ len according to the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st Ther@@ e@@ um , one explained the LI@@ GO employees for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometers long laser det@@ ector , and this is absurd , this length would have to be measured just less than a thousand of the radius of a nuclear kernel . this is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ v@@ itation
&quot; C@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are extensive . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cist are fin@@ der@@ ous and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 ; 42 years before his success .
back to LI@@ GO . Scott maintains that LI@@ GO is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial excer@@ pts , the size of your mobil@@ es . &quot;
this is quite practical . because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking advantage of several points of coming light around you .
with killing is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very hard , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean you especially much : &quot;
the face of your child approximately .
&quot; instead we lau@@ ghing according to specific properties such as sound condition , and height , rhythm and volume , to close the history behind it . &quot;
&quot; now speaking , Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob under@@ breaks them . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot produce simple pictures of objects in the space with them .
&quot; but by considering changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least lie for LI@@ GO the common frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so if we convert wave @-@ mu@@ ster in ver@@ all , we can speak the All literally . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ v@@ itation to lau@@ gh , can tell us about a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been very long employed . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not rotating holes , circulation simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
turn the two body very fast , you hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional audio change . that sounds so on : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u ! &quot;
&quot; it is a form of movement , shaped into the shaft form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date , which at least I will never forget -- heard LI@@ GO Fol@@ ders : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des Beh@@ us@@ ch &#93; J@@ em@@ and , who knows what he must hear , see this as a device of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which is about as fast as the sticks of your mix@@ er . &quot;
AA : we think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the di@@ cht@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO is a completely new way to resear@@ ching the Al@@ ls as it has never been possible .
on this way we can listen to the space and listen to the invisible .
much in all we can -- practically or fundamentally -- do not see .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why masks stars in super @-@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about the space .
&quot; however , the exciting physical processes do happen at the heart , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ lic@@ on . &quot;
we will never go through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . the urine would be happy to explore the first minutes of the Al@@ ls , but we will never see it , since the Ur@@ kn@@ all is covered by his own offspring . &quot;
the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
&quot; and probably the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , we will never see and of whom we have no idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO was right in the first run things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars , the black holes , such as LI@@ GO they observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are the way to speak for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO enables us to give us a completely different angle of view of events in space , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now consists of being as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the ru@@ ff@@ ness and cir@@ c@@ aries of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ at@@ ories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ at@@ ories on Earth and in space .
&quot; for what could be more beautiful than the judgment ? &quot;
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tasted an experiment .
&quot; one year I would say to all &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; before whom I feared . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , made me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
I wanted to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
I wanted to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the spectacle ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I fear , is my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear to hold speeches , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , gone . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; changed . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain Yes that my life changed deeply , on an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; sheep , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; cookies , I need milk for my beak @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once I could play with her , when I was just sitting on the leap . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; with a new attitude in my family . from there I swe@@ ar to play always with them , as soon as you say to me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I am always saying Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; fast . I am not perfect , but I felt very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only in short time , I actually understood that the &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; days to play with my children my career saved . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am author . I think things from , awak@@ ens you to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I produ@@ ci@@ er Television .
&quot; I make TV , in a great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for taking 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are at the same time in production . &quot;
&quot; each shipment offers hundreds of jobs , which previously did not exist . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a television player can lie between three and six million dollars .
say we five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days of four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollar TV , four radio programs , three episodes , three episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series are running on Thursday evening .
all over the world my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are ship@@ ments that I myself have created , and not just ob@@ end@@ ure . I must find time , really sti@@ lle , creative time to gather my fans about camp@@ fire and tell me my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who makes this still ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I would not like to impress you with this .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I say it to you , so that all of you who work so hard if I am talking about a company , a country or a classroom , make me seriously when I say about work , so that I say , I am saying , I understand that there is no dre@@ aming for dre@@ aming with a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country from nothing .
&quot; it is , when I set up troops , when I found myself on a screen . &quot;
&quot; as opposed to a high tone , running a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love it to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , ti@@ ring and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ern@@ al , cruel and rational , and the best thing about it is the sums . &quot;
there is such a change in me if the work runs well .
&quot; a sums begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sums h@@ ears like a busy road , I could always go on her . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I cl@@ ue to them the sums that I am writing writing that writing to me joy . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong that does it .
&quot; but when I started working with television production when I started working and working and working together , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy . &quot;
the sums is more than writing .
the sums is action and activity . the sums is a drug .
the sums is music . the sums of light and air .
the sums of God is the voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sums of money , then you cannot strive for size than according to size . &quot;
&quot; feeling , not to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sums .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
maybe it is genius .
maybe it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
&quot; I only know that I am not for failure , and I just know that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I will only tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear one : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more hi@@ ber@@ nation , the more things there , the more things are at the same time , the more watching me , the more I write history , all more expectations there . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country , which I managed , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sums of sums , the sums . &quot;
I like this sums . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the sums .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then stops the sums .
&quot; revised , over@@ exposed , over@@ drives , burned . &quot;
the sums stops .
&quot; now , my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their mother is a single working session . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; kitt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Country . &quot;
they are the children of a tit@@ ans .
you are baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums were listening . &quot;
the sums of the motor is hidden .
I did not loved my job any more . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my sums was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , no Reu@@ el , no Reu@@ el , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan sleeps not , there is not up with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ show @-@ Titan ;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sums and the sums I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you out , blocks the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do what you do , one loves to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , one loves to be a teacher , and knows how to get the sums you know when the sums stops , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart li@@ stens , I can survive in the silence ? &quot;
and then I asked me my &quot; South @-@ states @-@ Kell@@ ner@@ in &quot; a question .
&quot; I am on the way to outside , late , and she says , &quot; Mama , mag@@ st you play ? &quot;
and I want to say no more than I will be aware of two things :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , they called me not &quot; &quot; cookies &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it calls anyone more &quot; &quot; cookies &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I forgot it when I am Titan and my sums up , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so does it say , &quot; &quot; Mama , Do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special .
&quot; we play and their sisters encounter this , we lau@@ gh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ eliness and in the absence of the Sum@@ mens , I can do nothing but to quit . &quot;
I am foc@@ ussed .
I am quietly .
&quot; the country , which I managed , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax @-@ pins and the song , in which it goes slogan , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; The ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and a energy club comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums comes slowly back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
not the sums of sums but an sums .
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let us stay with the cause .
it is love . this is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the working environment , the tit@@ anium @-@ consumption , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , when I tell you , who I am , if I am careful using broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums is . &quot;
the sums is no strength and it is not work @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real sums depends on love .
&quot; the sums of money is the current , which comes from the way of life . &quot;
real sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sums ign@@ ores the pressure of history , which had to be finished tasks , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; real sums is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe God whis@@ per@@ ed God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I do not make the firm rule so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic of any debt .
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice but if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so simple . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
play for me not just as we work .
the truth does me sore ;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I preferred to work at the workplace than at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , for what kind of person does not work than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am to be relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we r@@ asen in the garden around , before and back , and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst rop@@ es .
&quot; in doing so , I feel mainly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused . &quot;
I am always looking for my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe met me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever heard with the games ?
you can also call it ! tell them yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
&quot; you have probably right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play at the most 15 minutes with me , until they end up to them that they want to make something different . &quot;
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes you will be replaced by Mari@@ k@@ äfer or K@@ eks .
&quot; and speak my teenage daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more needs it not . &quot;
&quot; everyone can take 15 minutes on the play , even on a bad La@@ une @-@ day ! &quot;
15 minutes by the piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
the day is short : dinner , the kids finished . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ sensitivity , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true to have the sums of feeling to have a place for his soul . &quot;
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about joy .
about the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
get the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it yourself .
&quot; I am not perfect at this . I sch@@ eit@@ ing and I victories . friends meet , books read , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; is short for everything I have given up , when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education , when I wanted to meet myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes by the piece , why not full 15 minutes &quot;
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sums seems to return if I do not work .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens up a door , the energy flow in and I find myself in my office . I hear a unknown melody , she fills me and my soul . she lost me to new ideas . I got it to his way back and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I do not love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sums of sums it is not me ... no more .
soap and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sums .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sums of work is part of me , but just one part . &quot;
&quot; it is straightforward , that I am a Titan I . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I are and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums up . the land , which I managed , the marathon , which I run , the tro@@ ll@@ es , the high tone , the sums , the right sums : the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , be@@ aming , naked and new life @-@ feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author . I think things , I awake you to life . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dre@@ am@@ job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
titles have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I am Neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or an automobile accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , a very small ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I have been functional Neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
&quot; certainly they have heard of one of the most famous ones , the &quot; lowering hir@@ n@@ stimulation &quot; . in doing so , one impl@@ anted an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the switching circles of the neur@@ ons so that neurological function has improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kin@@ son who suffered under fier@@ ce tre@@ m@@ bling and heavy pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean Ne@@ uro healing .
the dream of functional neurolog@@ ist is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leit@@ mot@@ if and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I cat@@ ered patients with sk@@ ull deer @-@ trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ mat@@ a the brain increases and the cran@@ ial pressure .
&quot; to save life , one has to dimin@@ ish the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
&quot; for this , one sometimes has to remove a part of world@@ ly brain . &quot;
&quot; rather than the weak@@ ened brain mass , we decided by Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , to analyse the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to let cells grow from a gun , comparable to all small children who are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve them . &quot;
this is precisely what we had to do with these cells .
after many searches it Jean @-@ François .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
this was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you know yet from the Bi@@ ology and that stem cells are un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of organism .
&quot; the adult brain has tri@@ bal cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small nav@@ y of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery .
we did a further fascinating observation : normal tri@@ bal cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die ; they are im@@ mor@@ tal .
&quot; however , these cells have kept differently . &quot;
they slowly shared themselves and after a few weeks they died even .
&quot; so we saw a new , wei@@ rd cell population which saw like a tri@@ bal cells , but were different . &quot;
&quot; we needed long to understand , where they came . &quot;
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our large @-@ stag cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us care about the folding of the brain .
but why stay it to us ?
we do not know .
&quot; we believe that they are participating in the healing of the brain , as we find it close to brain violations in higher concentr@@ ations . &quot;
but this is not so secure .
one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; we are facing a potential cell source , the brain healing . &quot;
this is what we had to prove .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experiment . &quot;
we wanted to take a piece of brain from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then the cells to cultiv@@ ate exactly as it Jean @-@ François did
&quot; and they then highlight , to follow them in the brain . &quot;
&quot; in the last step , we picked them at the det@@ ention of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ spl@@ antation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re@@ pl@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ pl@@ ate the same cells in sh@@ aded brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we picked up the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared , they go back home . the room is already occupied , so they will not disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we have a violation of and rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ative exactly the same cells and now remained the cells to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were irrit@@ ated .
&quot; the proof that they show are these small points . these are the cells , which we were in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
help these cells also to recover from a brain injury ?
&quot; so , we trained monkeys with a manual gift task . &quot;
they had to take for@@ pell@@ ets from a tray .
this made them very well .
&quot; as they had achieved a stable skill level , we have in the mot@@ oric cor@@ tex the Hand@@ mot@@ oric area . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to people , they recovered spont@@ aneously to some degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of sculp@@ tural brain mechanisms . you have to recover at a certain degree , just as the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had achieved his degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left you see the monkey , which spont@@ aneously recovered . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original power from injury to injury .
he is not so accurate and not so fast .
&quot; now , take a look at the same monkey : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze it and later use .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Par@@ kin@@ son . &quot;
but our dream is still alive to impl@@ ant them in people .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives the means to heal itself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies at the people . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kil@@ ograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried the permission to start the clinical trials . if you go further into the future , how many years it takes to come to hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select patients to perform and evaluate treatments , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , it must apply to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study . &quot;
you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment any one .
BG : and that it is safe but of course . J@@ B : of course .
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting us and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant , which is in reality , but as the inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as an un@@ change@@ able opposition .
we believe capitalism has inev@@ itably led to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have undoubtedly proven that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while the policy remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was in@@ comprehen@@ sible to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not likely to affect the austerity measures which were realised in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there might be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my reve@@ aling friends who would be repeated if they would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save us the democracy but that we need a true and def@@ ective democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies become common , our future is dark , and our great , new technologies . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of waste , I would like to point out at an interesting contradiction , which is currently our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; twin @-@ face @-@ par@@ adox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the school@@ berg , who thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; all of us recognize the Schul@@ den@@ berg , &quot;
but few of them are recognizing his f@@ eces .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is to be anxi@@ ous to invest it there , where it would be productive to invest it where it would be productive and produce all things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and the eurozone , 3.4 tri@@ llion goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment , and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tri@@ llion US dollar sounds like a lot of money , until it is compar@@ es with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ llion dollars , which are at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the IP@@ s and the property prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and Un@@ productive Capital form the Twin Towers that are not extinct by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , in which they do not invest . just like E@@ di@@ pus Father , who is out of fear , the Proph@@ ecy of the Or@@ ak@@ els could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow , &quot;
un@@ arous@@ ed the circumstances leading to that they kill him .
this is my ha@@ iry with capitalism --
&quot; its most vulnerable art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies , which are crucial to rescue the Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I think already . but before we proceed : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included naturally too many of --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , there would be an error , the significance of the ath@@ ic democracy due to these caps . &quot;
&quot; the decision of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they entered the working arms , not only the right to freedom of expression , but more importantly , and is crucial that they have the right to political co @-@ determination in questions of citizenship . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian Democracy has not held long --
&quot; like a candle , the very bright lights , it is also quickly burned . &quot;
&quot; however , our today &apos;s liberal democr@@ acies have not their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the Gl@@ orious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for ruling class . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy came only up , when a full separation of politics and economy was possible , while the democratic process was put into policy , while the economy - the world of corporations -- a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our today &apos;s democr@@ acies , since the time , in which this separation of politics and economy began , an un@@ her@@ edit@@ ary struggle between the two rather than the economy gradually displ@@ aced politics . &quot;
don &apos;t wonder why politicians are no longer like before ?
it is not about an de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is that one can now be in the government today , and still not in power , because the power of politics is divided into the economy and the fields are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ il@@ ders with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it is about as a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that are so lasting the animals , of which they harv@@ ested themselves , that they were hungry at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that the politics grows so far @-@ driven economic crisis . the power of corporations grows , political goods will be dispos@@ ed of inequality , the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are too anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their businesses . &quot;
&quot; the more successful the capitalism &quot; &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &quot; &#91; the people &#93; s@@ ells out of democracy , the higher the tw@@ ins , and the greater the waste of human labour power and of the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; control ret@@ ains , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t quite good .
&quot; the teaching from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working @-@ arms can only reg@@ ain a position as in the ancient Athens , without creating new kinds of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is one solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ ve employees through automation and robots .
&quot; the issue thereby is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , the automation can be higher in the tick , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts lower , as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we need to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , otherwise we end the re@@ united area , otherwise we end the film &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; like a documentation . &quot;
&quot; so the question is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements that he has caused , will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; or through something that the company will serve in &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; in the machinery to put their energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what is br@@ anded it , how could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar c@@ yst@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation I would like to thank you , in all soon , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the company : please introduce a capital market in which you deserve money , while you work and in which your capital is working on you from one job to the next , and the company - regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income from capital and rede@@ em and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , but no exchange between capital and labour , no major gaps between investment and don@@ ors , and ultimately no em@@ por@@ rag@@ ed tw@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , will be issued in the interest of the entire humanity . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , imagine that the entire world trade is tr@@ aded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that these funds are investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investment means r@@ ally . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that one had not had the technical means at that time .
&quot; today we have it , particularly in front of the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I preferred to you , is at the same time liber@@ Secretary , in which it is privileged people , and Marx@@ ists , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the M@@ ül@@ men of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ astic , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ astic . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we are w@@ aking up in such a world
or will we get into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar den@@ yst@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we can decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have to say is relevant then Marx is relevant .
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transmission of this crisis from part of the Earth to the next , as we experience it currently , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ aler democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is absolutely relevant , &quot;
&quot; as well as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ onic Marxist and how Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely wir@@ r . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are probably also . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ r , one does not think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosop@@ hical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China , and yesterday during the dinner of the speakers , you have very clearly told what you think of the perspective of the West in China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal democr@@ acies , we have the statement of a democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of the most cases , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain sense when I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resem@@ bles China today to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s an error , historically considered . &quot;
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
&quot; he was particularly skep@@ tical , which affects the democratic development . &quot;
&quot; what you can watch in China now , similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now , China is now being able to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century , called to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that a lot of audience is curious about your experiences as a financial minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I described that that comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to say to us from the self @-@ counter@@ cul@@ arity , and the persistent aband@@ on that a massive los@@ ure line went through the euro zone , and continues to pursue the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity to be based on the Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal was that denial was denial . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately it is correct to do . unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European group , continue to reject the denial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to receive an economic system , which is not viable , by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it may perhaps delay a while , but if the change occurs , it happens in the corrupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a financial minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est ...
&quot; if there is a Finance Minister , or any Minister who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , he claimed no mistakes , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the greatest mistake was to submit the request for the extension of the school programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the cred@@ itors to find a common solution .
but that was not there .
they just wanted to bring our government only because they did not want to deal with the inter@@ pret@@ ations carried out by the eurozone .
they did not want to conf@@ ess that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; neither from the Troika of the cred@@ itors , who has imposed us this policy and a &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive . &quot;
&quot; for if it does not survive , the fre@@ ed fli@@ ers will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not happen alone for Europe cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy of the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , that it seems to me , it will also be unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so you were with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; by Roy Price most of us have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision which Roy met for three years ago .
Roy Price is executive officer at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has a icons and describes itself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technique , Tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for providing the shows and the contents to produce at Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can not choose any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , who are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on the right on this corner . &quot;
this curve is the application distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows this review receive .
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , who , after having a season , your brain asks , &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows how &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- &quot; that should tell you enough what happens at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , as I think you already need special intelligence to sub@@ ordinate &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts on the middle output , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply ama@@ ze it . &quot;
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a thing , therefore Roy does not want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create achievements .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a contest . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he manufac@@ tures the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online where they can view all free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon comes out , there is something to be correct ? &quot;
millions of viewers look at this episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they will be observed when watching this shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who can record everything .
&quot; you can grasp when you start the show when you c@@ ens@@ ored , which parts you are ski@@ p or again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide with these data that show them should be produced .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US transm@@ itter . &quot;
they made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many of this show can remember , because they were not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7,@@ 4 is and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- a bit about the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time when another company has placed another manager a top @-@ show by data analysis . its name is Ted , Ted sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy it is always looking to find these a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it different . &quot;
&quot; instead of taking a competition , he and his team have looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows how shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use these data to find out these little details about the spect@@ ators : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a wagon and decided to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has suffered a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this corner . so exactly there , where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , is the question : what happened here ? &quot;
one has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed . &quot;
&quot; they connect with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
because logic somehow poss@@ essing that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years on statistics as Back @-@ Up .
one optimized it through very powerful computer .
&quot; the min@@ t , what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , then this is something fri@@ ghtening because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics in order to make serious decisions , far beyond the television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no . OK , this is even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in touch with this software . come in touch with this software , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if any one is in prison in the United States and in order to dismis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is made or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , which can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
&quot; this is not always the best results produced , which is not in mind that a company like multi @-@ Health system does not know how to use data . &quot;
also the data sealed companies are already wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google does not make mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can say through data analysis of out@@ breaks of flu , the sh@@ lim@@ men way , who can say , by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderful and was a great news sensation . the success in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked impeccable , year round year , until it suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature &quot; . &quot; &quot;
even the data rever@@ sible companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data depends in decisions of life - in the workplace , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted gen@@ etics -- an area where some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ able many data use to make serious decisions , such as decision for cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns regarding the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be circul@@ ated .
&quot; you have to solve a complex problem , do mainly use two things : &quot;
&quot; as a First , you put this issue into its parts , so you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second , you set the items back together to put a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things to take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to put parts back together and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all possess it all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something , when the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to come together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to take a good relief -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have data and mind , where they can also go in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , what else would not have been able to do so . but the decision on how to put all these parts again , and make it a show like &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show what meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they took care of TV @-@ ideas , then as they chose &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful them are , data is just a tool and not to forget that this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will judge it later with a techni@@ cian .
&quot; I have made some decisions in my life so far , where I would have to hear in the night on the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you of course know if you have the data available , you would like to replace them through a lot of ex@@ iting than data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; perhaps the ball will be kl@@ emp@@ tied and kl@@ ess and kl@@ ess . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that , despite the great amount of data still pays off , decisions to be an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks of which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks nice .
