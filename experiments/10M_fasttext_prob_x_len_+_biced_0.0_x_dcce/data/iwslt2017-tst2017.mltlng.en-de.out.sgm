<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They may know him because he won as a New York Times-Reporter the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before any one had heard by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he has published spectacular that the NSA is illegal phones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but it is another chapter, which should leave an extended impression."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA was literally over to Iran for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the crazy sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not fall into the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has been determined against Risen and prompted him to call him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol of the pattern of government, whistleblowers to condemn and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first Constitutional Treaty, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the patterns that they do."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government came with Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters already did before him: he refused, and said that he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015 Risen lived with the risk to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the process, something extraordinary something extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they were years of indications that it would be crucial for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring the reporter and sources are becoming less hide.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of fail and to bring revenge to the statements, that could also carry out his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigator, without his consent, his phone-wise geheim,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just as his email data, financial and banking information, his credit card, and even irritation with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-whistleblowers and cracks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is just one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama spoke to his acts, to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of that a whistleblowers went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the initial Constitutional Court, because the government has always has more possibilities to spose all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"while at the moment they can get in touch with the moment, rather than in the afterward, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that had not yet been written as Risen his book, and it is much safer than regular e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source headache system for whistle-blowers, which was originally developed by the website, which was developed by us Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation which I have been developed, further developed."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post here."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents directly or send information, just like with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are encrypted and stored on a server which only has the respective news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer make information secretly, and many of the information they would request, would not be available from advance."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately governments around the world develop new espionagetery technologies, which put us all at risk."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to us to ensure that not only technology denominator, such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to denounce offenders. it is just as important that we protect the next whale-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who want to report about abnormalities during the care of soldiers, and to report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alarm is beaten to the water of Flint. or a Wallstreet insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies have not only been made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the largest Datenleck of history has been published.] [the" Panama Papers "," that Reiche and powers have been hidden in tax havens.] [what does that mean?] [we bates Robert Palmer of Global Witness to make an explanation.] This week we were sent from news about a leeck of 11 million documents which in Panama based law firm Mosbags Fonseca. "</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies like Mosbags Fonseca go and say," okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, such as the whole system works, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has come back.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictators Baschar al-Assad stamp-companies in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous on the next release, and the next contained documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agency grilled or a John-grisham.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we handle what?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powers are able to hide their assets in tax havens and do not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, streets."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few of them, their assets are to hide and restrained -- something that we have been discussing and discussed for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people this whole world seems very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryodoll.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a firm in another company, in another company, in another company, what makes it almost impossible to really understand who lies behind these prayers."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for criminal law and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what is matter."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there were no prominent Americans now, which occurred in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mosquito Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data base from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have a lot more cases and examples see the connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information to specify less information to create a company than to get a librarian ID."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of inconsistency in the US has allowed the employees of schooldistrict to rip school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has scams to rip particularly anrandom investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent a covert investigator at the offices of 13 Anwaltsfirms in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators gave himself as a african Minister, who wanted to bring out some money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked it really, that all right up to an attorney from our investigator proposals made how he could be transferred his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all preachments. none of these lawyers took us as an clients, and of course anyone was handed over to pass on money. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as a solo.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has undergone proposals made by our coerted proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single peak of excellence, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules in order to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound all very trübingly, as if we could do nothing about it; as if nothing ever have changed, as if it is always the rich and mighty one."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as born Optimist I really see that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the last few years, we have seen precautions to more transparency, which affects the owners of firms."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland."</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU is in central registers at the national level, who really is behind firms in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind this.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a draft law in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, as a means is used to provide greater transparency in the United States and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who are angry when they see, how other people can hide their true identity behind headfirms."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in business, which stand up and say:" intransparent is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians, who recognize the problem and campaigning for it, by laws this kind of inconsistency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finish the intransparent, which now allow this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally finish."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, just as I almost kidnapped, and in the trunk of a red Mazdas would be."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I had completed my design studies, I made a backyard."</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red Mazda remained and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and had just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you miss this night?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know it yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" Oh, Man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What can I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleep place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I did not come to know him again! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he is really planning. I will not kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have an air mattresses. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," äh, how please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night, I was in bed, I rigid to the ceiling and thought:" Oh Mann! what did I have built myself there? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wilderness sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, on tenth of the bed, and my sleeping room closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork which he had bought from me today, depends today in his classroom. he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my perspectives.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers, actually friends who will only waited to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to host people on my airmattresses, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air conditioning."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a time jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost pledges, my roommate moves and the rent will be increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think, creativity can do it to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new fellow-inhabitants Brian Chesky:" Brian, I talked about how we could earn something about it. our apartment is offered to a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and green so called "Airmatratze and Breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattresses on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I'm sure to decorate our cheese ham warks completely different, because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we were touring with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, starred Brian and I went."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nata Brarczyk, joined us as developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented our Investors:" we want to create a website dedicated to the people public images of their private rooms post, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind rooms, whose doors are closed when you visit. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the internet, they can invite the wild people to stay in them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"however, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody who is still at comfort, would be investing in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have all learnt as children that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem you have on the things you can well. we could disintegrate.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptik -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to discontinued objects like objects, but now we wanted to create trust through design immense trust between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design achieve such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a co-tasting, which degree of confidence we strive."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unmatched mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quietly pflug of panic, which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door."</seg>
<seg id="158">"for the only thing, which is more personal than your mobile phone, is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your text, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the blamed cell phone of a foreigner in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">You can also feel most guests when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">"for this reason, our company can exist."</seg>
<seg id="164">"just so, who has actually Al Gores mobile phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell us on Twitter that he resigned for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour would have been introduced once with his name; if he says, whence he comes, how his dog or his children are hot?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 assessments who all say: "he can really hold very well blamed wrys!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then if you would have to post your phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-known feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">"it was difficult for people to cut negative opinions."</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both hosts as well as guest had passed their findings, before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we studied with Stanford a study. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are about age and home."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social incursion.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting will be when you add the call of a person -- in our case by Beuressments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three commandments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation with similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can therefore help us overcome some of our deep-root preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we learned that confidence is dependent on how much you are at price."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little about how for example" "Hi!," you do not get an answer. "</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells us a lot, as for example:" I have problems with my mother "--" -- the request is also not accepted. "</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, for example" "Tolle" "in your apartment! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"" "our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices toward foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we did not reckoned, was the great amount of people who were more than willing to present these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">See how many people use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"firstly, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly, a need that had not been covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business works very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been allowed parties are celebrated or apartments vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I have worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the front, when confidence has been broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing Schlimmerit as these calls. it does already hurt when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of caller, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves further."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, of the 123 million overnight stays only a fraction ever had a fraction ever."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if confidence works, it may arise miracles."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host was brought him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgement:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, which tend to be due to sitting activities to heart attack."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real protective angel, who save a life, even though they don't know correctly."</seg>
<seg id="218">"they drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait, while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay is running."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money-transaction is exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with cash transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now it's simply to call" "rent industry", "the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">"Share Economy describes a trade, human relationships promises."</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, this is compared to Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but for less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"however, what would be when travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place, you would like to wait, a group of announcing it would wait to fill a thoroughly clean and one in a pub / area that one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are arranged according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to make apartments of reason for co-operation?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be if cities would have the thoughts of common sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships instead of loneliness and waste.</seg>
<seg id="239">"in Southern French capital Seoul, this project has already been started. many parking spaces, which were belonging to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"were now being offered residents. students who were looking for a lead,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"people were conveyed to people whose children were educated. there were incubators, were started."</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. through our platform alone, night 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest in a stranger or even hosts."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea does not seem to be crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">"hospitality, there were also before."</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar sites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has it just done our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that one can find the right design with the components of the trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-root prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find this amazingly,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Straight to overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it if a red Mazda goes over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I ask myself for what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Perhaps even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brain-underwear underwent a terrorist threat?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security on the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"thus, media people represent that look like me."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met a Muslim: it is great, you will meet."</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted.</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegar-Fitness-Fanatikerin</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen me."</seg>

<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that horrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had at the end of the breakfast, I looked at the screen and saw the word" Eilat. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flocks in buildings, people pranged from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned into outrage quickly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I joined the television canal and heard:..." Muslim terrorists "..."... in the name of Islam... "..."... "..."... "..."... "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu transformed me the actions of others from a civil war in a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the US to move into a new city and begin with the study of integration."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as I drove -- as we silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I feared the first time being feared as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we went out this night into our apartment, in a new city, where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said," be watchful, "" sells in well illuminated areas, "" Versammmelt you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday at that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage of this process.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who stopped for Muslims, into the free movement."</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who had attacked this country to have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I criticized the wut of the people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"nowadays, we can actually say guys:" "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to make Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak about my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It just raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">"they know: a malignant tumor, one is removed as a whole and a benign tumour, only under observation."</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are useless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims like all the other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a life-important organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthelfer and Olympionians. "</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be some parking free of charge, but not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque is leading to view people other faith tolerant, and to show greater citizens."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a head of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently said: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"when the radicalalization process one has noticed that he begins online, even from her family so that the person believes that the person believes that the people believe the true Muslims, and anyone who despises their behavior and their ideology is a traitor, or from faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must keep people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still be claiming that Islam is a non-violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes their brutality with the Quran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as Muslims, as a mother, as a person, I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>

<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku club-club with Christianity.</seg>

<seg id="344">"but if one throws a look at it, it is not driving what they are blown in her" Holy Scripture. "</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me a amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because they hid themselves to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said, the problem was exactly the opposite. each spiritual man had talked with whom she had spoken, she brought to silence, and said that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, they would only bring in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"from nothing inspired and something that would have given their anger sense, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists that you spoke one solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam presented the connection to God and their church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of blame them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight as the Islamophobia me and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our thoughts?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear we happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept more an authorized governmental system, conformance and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if you report testing news, in which negative about Muslims reported it was rather military attack on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you look when the mood against Muslims upwards - between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times but never happened in connection with the terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"thus, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terror as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public in order to realise the foundation of a free society, the sensible and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early Warnmarks.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we might feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear shines us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the assignment of collectivism, it is not just about to explain himself."</seg>

<seg id="410">Interlocking air devices reach high speed and acceleration on the narrowest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-constantly able structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear loads, to deal with turmoil and in general react to natural legislation."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the limits of the Possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order to create a system autonomous, it needs to know the collective procurement where the mobile objects can be found."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamical tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localized technology of Verity Studios, a offsprings of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level e. e.g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called heckstarter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">"a flight device, which tries to beat two flies with a flap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starrator, it is efficient in advance, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starrens it can vibrate, and thus has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of heckers is that they are sensitive to turmoil like windsurfing.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the leaflet doesn't matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often present fundamental abstract issues that lead to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"such a question would be, for example: what is the smaller number of moveable parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons why you want to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that work together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained drivers were flying controlled air appliances, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a tailgate."</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospinner, the mechanical, simplest remote device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it only has a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no valves, hinders and cross-sections, no further actuator or controlloid surfaces, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanical simple, happens in the interior living very much so that it can fly stable and move into the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to get it to the flies, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood, to throw it right if all watch, is small, therefore I show you a video that was filmed for yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in genesis, this machine is here, the bus-head with his eight propellors, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrically balanced.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus, he will receive the proper capability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is filmed or even how it is rotating."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellors."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is conceivable in models, the rest will be learned directly at the subject."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see ourselves this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate twin-propellers machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is reflected in the clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"if you build them, they are like a high-performance Quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or an accumulator can continue the machine even if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by making a half plane.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic heat.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took wholesale micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a slice bread -- and provide it with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine since it would like to be on Broadway a flying lamp.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the salary is in development and creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a memory, as wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures, to form them in so spectacular ways."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my token Father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that which I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been examined for 23 years of gravitational waves of black holes and their by observatories like LIGO measurable signals. what are the gravitational waves? "</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cursor in the space of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"while temporary, the wave will become the space and its entire content into one direction is stretched and into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"at the show, lecturers in courses on the relativity-theory often lead a really albering dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each one of us was stretched with the waves of the waves and punched. the stretching of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 Nullen according to the comma, followed by a 1st Thereum, one explained the LIGO employees for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometers long laser detector, and this is absurd, this length would have to be measured just less than a thousand of the radius of a nuclear kernel. this is grotesk."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"CIP Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties when building such detectors are extensive. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicist are finderous and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this 1973; 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott maintains that LIGO is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial excerpts, the size of your mobiles."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking advantage of several points of coming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With killing is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very hard, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean you especially much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we laughing according to specific properties such as sound condition, and height, rhythm and volume, to close the history behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now speaking, Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob underbreaks them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce simple pictures of objects in the space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by considering changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the common frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wave-muster in verall, we can speak the All literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravitation to laugh, can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been very long employed."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotating holes, circulation simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very fast, you hear the same circus with an additional audio change. that sounds so on: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu! "</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a form of movement, shaped into the shaft form."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date, which at least I will never forget -- heard LIGO Folders: [Surrendes Behusch] Jemand, who knows what he must hear, see this as a device of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun mass, which is about as fast as the sticks of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dichtest body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO is a completely new way to researching the Alls as it has never been possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the space and listen to the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practically or fundamentally -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why masks stars in super-novae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about the space.</seg>
<seg id="538">"however, the exciting physical processes do happen at the heart, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. the urine would be happy to explore the first minutes of the Alls, but we will never see it, since the Urknall is covered by his own offspring."</seg>
<seg id="541">The gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">"and probably the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, we will never see and of whom we have no idea. things we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO was right in the first run things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars, the black holes, such as LIGO they observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are the way to speak for our archaeological work. "</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO enables us to give us a completely different angle of view of events in space, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists of being as bold as possible.</seg>

<seg id="554">Some time ago I tasted an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"one year I would say to all" "Yes!" "before whom I feared."</seg>
<seg id="556">"no matter if it made me nervous, made me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say" yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="557">I wanted to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">I wanted to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the spectacle?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I fear, is my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear to hold speeches, my social fear -- Puff, gone."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life has changed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "yes" "changed."</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain Yes that my life changed deeply, on an unexpected kind. it began with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls for inexplicable reasons all" sheep, "</seg>

<seg id="572">"she asked me once I could play with her, when I was just sitting on the leap. and I said," yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"with a new attitude in my family. from there I swear to play always with them, as soon as you say to me. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I am always saying Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"fast. I am not perfect, but I felt very much."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an amazing side effect: only in short time, I actually understood that the" "Yes" "days to play with my children my career saved."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am author. I think things from, awakens you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I producier Television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make TV, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for taking 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>

<seg id="593">In America my television series are running on Thursday evening.</seg>

<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are shipments that I myself have created, and not just obendure. I must find time, really stille, creative time to gather my fans about campfire and tell me my stories."</seg>

<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think, when the word" "author" "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you, so that all of you who work so hard if I am talking about a company, a country or a classroom, make me seriously when I say about work, so that I say, I am saying, I understand that there is no dreaming for dreaming with a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work much, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deepened into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set up troops, when I found myself on a screen."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as opposed to a high tone, running a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love it to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and rational, and the best thing about it is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me if the work runs well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a sums begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums hears like a busy road, I could always go on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I clue to them the sums that I am writing writing that writing to me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but when I started working with television production when I started working and working and working together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums of light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums of God is the voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sums of money, then you cannot strive for size than according to size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling, not to be different than to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I am not for failure, and I just know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear one: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more hibernation, the more things there, the more things are at the same time, the more watching me, the more I write history, all more expectations there."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country, which I managed, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the sums of sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stops the sums.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overexposed, overdrives, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mother is a single working session."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda Country."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums were listening."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the motor is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not loved my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, no Reuel, no Reuel, nothing delegating, a Titan sleeps not, there is not up with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a pre-show-Titan;</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think," "Heul you out, blocks the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do what you do, one loves to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, one loves to be a teacher, and knows how to get the sums you know when the sums stops, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart listens, I can survive in the silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then I asked me my "South-states-Kellnerin" a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way to outside, late, and she says," Mama, magst you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no more than I will be aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, they called me not" "cookies". ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"it calls anyone more" "cookies". ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I forgot it when I am Titan and my sums up, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so does it say," "Mama, Do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters encounter this, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "Everybody Poops". ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and in the absence of the Summens, I can do nothing but to quit."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quietly.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, which I managed, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax-pins and the song, in which it goes slogan, or whatever the girl in" "The ice cream." ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and a energy club comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums of sums but an sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. this is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working environment, the titanium-consumption, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, when I tell you, who I am, if I am careful using broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the sums of money is the current, which comes from the way of life."</seg>
<seg id="711">Real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums ignores the pressure of history, which had to be finished tasks, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"real sums is God's voice in my ear, but maybe God whispered God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love. "</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I do not make the firm rule so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice but if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so simple. I am not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Play for me not just as we work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does me sore;</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I preferred to work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, for what kind of person does not work than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>

<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe met me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever heard with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also call it! tell them yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naïve for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">"you have probably right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet-Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play at the most 15 minutes with me, until they end up to them that they want to make something different."</seg>

<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children. it is about joy.</seg>
<seg id="759">About the "Play" in general.</seg>

<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return if I do not work.</seg>

<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens up a door, the energy flow in and I find myself in my office. I hear a unknown melody, she fills me and my soul. she lost me to new ideas. I got it to his way back and love my work again."</seg>

<seg id="795">Thanks nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or an automobile accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, a very small ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I have been functional Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"certainly they have heard of one of the most famous ones, the" lowering hirnstimulation ". in doing so, one implanted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the switching circles of the neurons so that neurological function has improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered under fierce trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean Neuro healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurologist is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leitmotif and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I catered patients with skull deer-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at Schädel-Hirmata the brain increases and the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, one has to diminish the cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, one sometimes has to remove a part of worldly brain."</seg>
<seg id="817">"rather than the weakened brain mass, we decided by Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, to analyse the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to let cells grow from a gun, comparable to all small children who are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is precisely what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many searches it Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know yet from the Biology and that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has tribal cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small navy of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did a further fascinating observation: normal tribal cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">"however, these cells have kept differently."</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly shared themselves and after a few weeks they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, weird cell population which saw like a tribal cells, but were different."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed long to understand, where they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our large-stag cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus care about the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay it to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they are participating in the healing of the brain, as we find it close to brain violations in higher concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we are facing a potential cell source, the brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">This is what we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then the cells to cultivate exactly as it Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">"and they then highlight, to follow them in the brain."</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we picked them at the detention of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we replate these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we replate the same cells in shaded brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we picked up the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared, they go back home. the room is already occupied, so they will not disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we have a violation of and reimplative exactly the same cells and now remained the cells to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were irritated.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the proof that they show are these small points. these are the cells, which we were in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we trained monkeys with a manual gift task."</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take forpellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">This made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"as they had achieved a stable skill level, we have in the motoric cortex the Handmotoric area."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen to people, they recovered spontaneously to some degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of sculptural brain mechanisms. you have to recover at a certain degree, just as the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had achieved his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left you see the monkey, which spontaneously recovered."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original power from injury to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, take a look at the same monkey: the same monkey, two months after the plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still alive to implant them in people.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives the means to heal itself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies at the people."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate etc. "</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried the permission to start the clinical trials. if you go further into the future, how many years it takes to come to hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select patients to perform and evaluate treatments, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, it must apply to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">You really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment any one.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe but of course. JB: of course.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant, which is in reality, but as the inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as an unchangeable opposition.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism has inevitably led to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have undoubtedly proven that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while the policy remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy comes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was incomprehensible to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not likely to affect the austerity measures which were realised in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my revealing friends who would be repeated if they would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save us the democracy but that we need a true and defective democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies become common, our future is dark, and our great, new technologies."</seg>
<seg id="914">"for the issue of waste, I would like to point out at an interesting contradiction, which is currently our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "twin-face-paradox." ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the schoolberg, who throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"all of us recognize the Schuldenberg,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few of them are recognizing his feces.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which is to be anxious to invest it there, where it would be productive to invest it where it would be productive and produce all things that humanity urgently needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and the eurozone, 3.4 trillion goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment, and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollar sounds like a lot of money, until it is compares with the 5,1 trillion dollars, which are at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the IPs and the property prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and Unproductive Capital form the Twin Towers that are not extinct by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54 year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, in which they do not invest. just like Edipus Father, who is out of fear, the Prophecy of the Orakels could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unaroused the circumstances leading to that they kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hairy with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its most vulnerable art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially to finance all the technologies," green "technologies, which are crucial to rescue the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think already. but before we proceed: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy included naturally too many of --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, there would be an error, the significance of the athic democracy due to these caps."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision of the Athenian democracy was and is that they entered the working arms, not only the right to freedom of expression, but more importantly, and is crucial that they have the right to political co-determination in questions of citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian Democracy has not held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, the very bright lights, it is also quickly burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our today's liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta which was ultimately a statute for ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy came only up, when a full separation of politics and economy was possible, while the democratic process was put into policy, while the economy - the world of corporations -- a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our today's democracies, since the time, in which this separation of politics and economy began, an unhereditary struggle between the two rather than the economy gradually displaced politics."</seg>
<seg id="942">Don't wonder why politicians are no longer like before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not about an degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is that one can now be in the government today, and still not in power, because the power of politics is divided into the economy and the fields are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hailders with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it is about as a flock of carnivores that are so lasting the animals, of which they harvested themselves, that they were hungry at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy that the politics grows so far-driven economic crisis. the power of corporations grows, political goods will be disposed of inequality, the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are too anxious to invest the cash of their businesses."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful the capitalism" "demos" "[the people] sells out of democracy, the higher the twins, and the greater the waste of human labour power and of the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the" demos "control retains, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it wasn't quite good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working-arms can only regain a position as in the ancient Athens, without creating new kinds of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing Niedriglove employees through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the issue thereby is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, the automation can be higher in the tick, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts lower, as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we need to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, otherwise we end the reunited area, otherwise we end the film" "matrix" "like a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so the question is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements that he has caused, will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystia, similar to the" "matrix", "or through something that the company will serve in" "Star Trek", "in the machinery to put their energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora, "in long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what is branded it, how could it look like this" star Trek "" utopia instead of the "matrix" -similar cystia? "</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation I would like to thank you, in all soon, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of the company: please introduce a capital market in which you deserve money, while you work and in which your capital is working on you from one job to the next, and the company - regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and redeem and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, but no exchange between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and donors, and ultimately no emporraged twins."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], will be issued in the interest of the entire humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"furthermore, imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" "Cosmos", "in units of" Cosmos "" -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country, into a common fund. "</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that these funds are investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world in which investment means rally."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that one had not had the technical means at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have it, particularly in front of the background of a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I preferred to you, is at the same time liberSecretary, in which it is privileged people, and Marxists, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the Mülmen of history, and keynesiastic, globally keynesiastic."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We are waking up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we get into a "matrix" - similar denystia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we can decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as a libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have to say is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... do we do that, technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand, which is called Larry Summers as" long term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transmission of this crisis from part of the Earth to the next, as we experience it currently, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberaler democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is absolutely relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as well as Hayek, that's why I am a libertonic Marxist and how Keynes, and therefore I am completely wirr."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are probably also."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you are not wirr, one does not think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China, and yesterday during the dinner of the speakers, you have very clearly told what you think of the perspective of the West in China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"in our liberal democracies, we have the statement of a democracy."</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of the most cases, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain sense when I may say that provocative, China today resembles China today to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that's an error, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, such as John Stuart Mill -- "</seg>
<seg id="997">"he was particularly skeptical, which affects the democratic development."</seg>
<seg id="998">"what you can watch in China now, similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now, China is now being able to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century, called to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that a lot of audience is curious about your experiences as a financial minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I described that that comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to say to us from the self-countercularity, and the persistent abandon that a massive losure line went through the euro zone, and continues to pursue the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity to be based on the Greek proposal -- the way, the first proposal was that denial was denial."</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately it is correct to do. unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the European group, continue to reject the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to receive an economic system, which is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism in life, it may perhaps delay a while, but if the change occurs, it happens in the corrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price most of us have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision which Roy met for three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is executive officer at Amazon Studios, "</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slender, has a icons and describes itself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technique, Tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for providing the shows and the contents to produce at Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can not choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, who are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are on the right on this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the application distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows this review receive.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones "," "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows, who, after having a season, your brain asks," where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows how" "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- "that should tell you enough what happens at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, as I think you already need special intelligence to subordinate" "Toddlers and Tiaras". ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts on the middle output, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply amaze it."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a thing, therefore Roy does not want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create achievements.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a contest."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he manufactures the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online where they can view all free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon comes out, there is something to be correct?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they will be observed when watching this shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who can record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can grasp when you start the show when you censored, which parts you are skip or again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data that show them should be produced.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom over four Republican US transmitter. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "Alpha House", "but it seems that not many of this show can remember, because they were not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7,4 is and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- a bit about the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time when another company has placed another manager a top-show by data analysis. its name is Ted, Ted sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy it is always looking to find these a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of taking a competition, he and his team have looked at the existing data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows how shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use these data to find out these little details about the spectators: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went a wagon and decided to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards ". Netflix has suffered a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this corner. so exactly there, where they wanted to go. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, is the question: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed. "</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow possessing that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data for a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years on statistics as Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">One optimized it through very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the mint, what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, then this is something frightening because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics in order to make serious decisions, far beyond the television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no. OK, this is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in touch with this software. come in touch with this software, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if any one is in prison in the United States and in order to dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is made or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad, is decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, which can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">"this is not always the best results produced, which is not in mind that a company like multi-Health system does not know how to use data."</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data sealed companies are already wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google does not make mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that they can say through data analysis of outbreaks of flu, the shlimmen way, who can say, by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news sensation. the success in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked impeccable, year round year, until it suddenly no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature "." "</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data reversible companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data depends in decisions of life - in the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginable many data use to make serious decisions, such as decision for cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns regarding the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be circulated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you have to solve a complex problem, do mainly use two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a First, you put this issue into its parts, so you can analyse the individual parts; as a second, you set the items back together to put a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things to take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put parts back together and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something, when the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to come together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to take a good relief -- especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore I believe, Netflix was so successful because they have data and mind, where they can also go in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, what else would not have been able to do so. but the decision on how to put all these parts again, and make it a show like" "House of Cards", "that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show what meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they took care of TV-ideas, then as they chose" "Alpha House". ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things are going wrong when data begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful them are, data is just a tool and not to forget that this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will judge it later with a technician.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"I have made some decisions in my life so far, where I would have to hear in the night on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you of course know if you have the data available, you would like to replace them through a lot of exiting than data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"perhaps the ball will be klemptied and kless and kless. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that, despite the great amount of data still pays off, decisions to be an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks of which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
