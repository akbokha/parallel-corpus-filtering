Munich 1856 : four cards to change your view of the city
Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where young people should encounter young people .
a se@@ ft@@ elle where now for the S @-@ Bahn tun@@ nels .
small @-@ gar@@ den@@ ers manage the obvious reason of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich encourages exciting stories to days .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; that knows each who had to rain himself , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i was held instead a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State government , are all others as currently - but is therefore very enligh@@ tening . &quot;
especially when you compare them with current online cards .
&quot; then , the towns and municipalities are clearly changed in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ r@@ epp@@ i that one does not recognize as such .
&quot; in the large picture map , for towns and communities have been more detailed maps , so @-@ called urine sheets . &quot;
this came into force according to the Bay@@ arian Ver@@ meas@@ ure@@ Government between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and ski@@ p the first Ver@@ messung Bay@@ t .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leaders in Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ war with Austria .
Napoleon presents an overview of the occupied country and gave an top@@ ographical inclusion of Bay@@ t in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops served with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 , there were today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a surface of Bavaria map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph drove the project further forward , founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische devotion government . &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tional sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the Bav@@ arian State Agency .
&quot; the comparison of fruits / Today is an example of the state capital , on the example of the state capital . &quot;
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated .
&quot; Send@@ ling was divided 21 years after creating the map , so 1877 , as a Mün@@ ch@@ ner district . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses sub@@ sen@@ dl@@ ings focus on 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was first named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the rebellion of the Bav@@ arian farmer against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : when Hin@@ d@@ oma appears a smaller dis@@ advant@@ aged card with do@@ zens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written fl@@ ur@@ ts from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; urine &quot; , &quot; from which the basic tax has been derived . &quot;
&quot; small plots , there are no farmers more - but small @-@ gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is characterized by sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 show@@ room of the October Revolution , was actually a meadow - and no concrete . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of mental medicine .
&quot; in the Ur@@ posi@@ tional sheet , one reads in the area of today &apos;s A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen only the road &quot; &quot; Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or from the height &quot; &quot; On the Lü@@ der &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ fel@@ d@@ strasse , there were once people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ ch@@ ner circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ der .
&quot; since 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden did the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist that is associated with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the res@@ ins of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
&quot; in addition , he is forbidden to use the personnel to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen who has engaged in an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients first had been place , later on 500 places were expanded . &quot;
at some point this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ k house in hair 1905 .
&quot; there since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of the largest Psy@@ chiat@@ ry Germany . &quot;
the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt will now meet young people in the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Sal@@ esi@@ um .
&quot; the Order was built in the building complex in 1920 , and walked in a youth @-@ home with educational training . &quot;
&quot; west is the football field of the T@@ SV Munich East , east of residence from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 we set up the children &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; - in ar@@ quit@@ ecture to the origin of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt during World War II . &quot;
&quot; the Marien@@ platz was to be 1856 in 1856 than &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the purchase of the purchase &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 many holes in the city centre .
one big stayed until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
&quot; the German Institute , small business buildings and a se@@ ft@@ atory from the Middle Ages were once at the Marien@@ hof , where these days were the pre @-@ work and on 5 April 2017 of the sp@@ aten@@ sti@@ ch for the second S @-@ Bahn . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the air@@ picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marien@@ hof . &quot;
citizen @-@ law published travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the promotion of coloured people is issued a warning for colored people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i on the basis of discrimination policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the State .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to come into force until 28 August 2017 , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of frag@@ ments , r@@ amp@@ @-@ based inci@@ dents in recent times throughout the country and here are noted , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recent adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder to gain dis@@ discrimination , as well as the imp@@ unity bodies of the state , the dis@@ proportion@@ ate to minorities , promp@@ ted the group to make the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights to happen .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are be@@ aten or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ansas City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet .
it is the first such warning that has issued the organization for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group quoted inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist en@@ forced against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , S@@ anders died at the beginning of the year after he had no gas@@ oline during the journey by the state , and was taken into custo@@ dy by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also shows a recent report of the office of the Office of General Law@@ yers , which is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state 75 percent is more common than past@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready whether to bring Cau@@ ters or make their relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 H@@ ass@@ ver@@ ge in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the H@@ ass@@ ver@@ bre@@ g reporting program of the F@@ BI , which took the state with respect to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to complain a company because of living or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union had published the war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , after the states of immigration laws to commit men because of immigration crimes , resulting in the opinion of the AC@@ LU to further pensions . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings will usually be issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but lately stakeholders have used the action as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
crossover project is spontaneous .
the Fis@@ her@@ acher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ovac has changed a picture on the ground .
at the Ri@@ grab@@ en@@ hof of the family Schwen@@ de@@ mann met representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ acher CD@@ U town@@ ships together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted first insights into its operation , in which he produces 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk kitchen and also houses many young animals and houses in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; black milk &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative mark@@ er mark@@ er for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
the table of the guests is exclusively regional .
&quot; since he also has a BL@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ bach , he described the Wei@@ dec@@ ay project as &quot; spontaneous . &quot; &quot;
I can not manage on such steep areas not profitable .
&quot; the green space for a lot of work , much has been dealt with the motor sense . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ astic operation and managed this without any chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if he does not lead the bio@@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognised the importance of the ordination project , and is happy about the leader of the leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per h@@ ect@@ are , the farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the performance of the areas could be moved even for a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure that we have , are people who work in agriculture and make themselves thinking about how to continue their business , &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers stand because of encour@@ agement often in criticism
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the surface area is 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ested until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the total amount of 71 500 euros the half was funded by leader , a quarter carried the village of fishing . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers had to invest 12 610 Euro , which had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; stated Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ovac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmers and land . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter White stand firm : &quot; &quot; here the best food is produced . &quot;
Land@@ sc@@ apes ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of past@@ ures .
the aim is the disclosure of the Schwar@@ zw@@ alds .
prerequisite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR re@@ marked convey@@ ance .
&quot; moreover , the wrong area may not be un@@ ep@@ is@@ hable ( Hang@@ ing over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the performance . &quot;
&quot; for the fisher@@ man Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ ching project 2018 , the application of eight participants are currently running with 24 plots , which are just under 16 kilometers fence . &quot;
&quot; the surface area corresponds to 35 hectares , the cold cost of more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty .
the safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
&quot; the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence , the careful overthrow Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew what he did when he did a symbolic A@@ xt in a h@@ it@@ ous dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals of the President to the dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller does not handle the statue itself . &quot;
&quot; a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty impor@@ ters would have suffered him , if he had done it . &quot;
&quot; but he laid their significance , and especially the meaning that you have been written as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , has been added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go here on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that is illuminated the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem which you refer to , which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is not really true , but as he form@@ ulate it , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the sho@@ ok words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state would not only invite any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your fatigue , your poor , / your arms , freely to breathe / the el@@ ong@@ ing waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there has never been a time in which the &quot; el@@ dest waste &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller has not committed himself in liter@@ ary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural examination : it is indeed a conflict with the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well that they were a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republi@@ can@@ ism by presented the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives himself a completely different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , the people wanted to change from the right wing this long time . &quot;
&quot; the great writer Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a sort of Johannes the Bap@@ tist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argu@@ ed 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not one @-@ conservative , but rather an early ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ atives that bring American flame into the re@@ marked world . &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it shall bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something engra@@ ved .
the significance of the statue is quite and certainly a question of the point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative fact of Lazarus consisted of removing them to see how they were seen by the exhausted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ ks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people , looking for refu@@ ge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective of recognise Miller and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; your F@@ ack@@ el is not supposed to enligh@@ ten the way , but the hat@@ red , which is their only source of power , ign@@ ite . &quot;
WH@@ C 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ aves Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle remin@@ ding itself at a time when only two vill@@ i belonging to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the performance Director of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ heads of the World Championship has a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
&quot; Black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand and we will continue it , until we find it out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is absolutely brilliant .
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals for medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m line , while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected by the crew to the team leader . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest .
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were narrow , or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and genuine feeling , the E@@ ili@@ dh was completely natural , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth of silver medals in its fifth World Championships , in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that it &apos;s &quot; unbelievable , &quot; that 16 car@@ r@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s largest number of athletes in the world championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the mid@@ section Mu@@ ir runs on this path and has placed five British and two European records over the past year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another shot that one should be observed after a great season that would be the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ yle remembered their first world Championships , as the only other so@@ ons in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; the Mann@@ ist capitals says that they are &quot; &quot; enormously proud &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of their land@@ lords are not only part of the team , but in some cases also among the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special about to be part of the team that was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was anyway a great honor , but to know that my team mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as an established athletes , athletes who want to rise on Po@@ dium . &quot;
what is my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put on this home support and benefit that we are back at the Olympi@@ ast@@ adi@@ on .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere , out there . &quot;
blocking of critics concerning Facebook : don &apos;t carry you a public office if you cannot wear the heating of the voters
the Father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers sw@@ allow him because of all , from interior policies to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he resign@@ ed with criticism , secure . &quot;
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we will run like the sheep to the battles . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland at Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who must work on it , more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ endant him from the beginning of this week .
&quot; the st@@ ab of the Govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of an object with &quot; &quot; Well , and ? &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a Republi@@ que Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amazing . &quot;
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ ar@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore the block@@ ages of persons who come to the side of the govern@@ ors - which is officially referred to as an official forum , which is officially referred to as officially and by workers who are paid with public tax currency - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Ch@@ asse Ch@@ asse the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the block@@ ages of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of trou@@ t or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ edge @-@ filled people , who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the mail spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a entre@@ pren@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; they all said , that their comments were respectful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ited . &quot;
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and app@@ liance to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyers in Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ edge @-@ filled , but she asked to break down . &quot;
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current messages , &quot; &quot; wrote them in the commentary box of the news &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people is taking place on the same issue , it is regarded as a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employee of the Govern@@ ors identified as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; , &quot; would others probably call &quot; &quot; pron@@ unci@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocks a critics or deleted a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner as in former time , if one had done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guidance and to burn or burn demonstr@@ ators and to silence . &quot;
but that is exactly what happens digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials to critic@@ ise his Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is contrac@@ ted by Twitter users who have been blocked by its Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the President of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County last the first A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. district , James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she called a voters from her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Pre@@ in ( R ) was also a visit to the AC@@ LU for its use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
it should not be as difficult .
&quot; at the time Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous brief@@ ing sm@@ ote to his leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; the people , the pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers , the Washington &apos;s decisions made . &quot;
&quot; petition , who cri@@ tici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with the UK , overwhel@@ med by the historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not brought them to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raf@@ fer@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European Union no . 1 Ron@@ an Raf@@ fer@@ ty will hope in the next three days in domestic comfort , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an will be held on the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who conducted next year next door in the Ar@@ cher@@ field Links to final results , before he lost to Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new Australia &apos;s name and act as a tournament botan@@ icals in the name of the association and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reaches his glory with this event , &quot; said Raf@@ fer@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot;
&quot; Jerry made a great job , when he laid this place . &quot;
he is a eag@@ erly supporters of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won the European tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; this really feels very special , &quot; said the &quot; &quot; South@@ port &quot; &quot; said in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , as it was in the year after I had gained them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories come back from the last year , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
Gary Or@@ r who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel these additional printing . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am glad about how far gone .
&quot; with the trio on the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six r@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with a car and £ 10 per car with two or more in@@ mates . &quot;
all proceeds will go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
over the past two decades fewer people have died fewer people because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
to this end scientists come to the university hospital in Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ ke ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , per year 167 pneum@@ atic cancer is due to passive smoking , &quot; said Ph@@ ko B@@ echer . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved to this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were also 400 lung cancer in Germany because of passi@@ v@@ ital@@ ism per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
Haus@@ smann prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and lie in the time , &quot; thus the leader of the Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house closures , the situation is more complicated than suspected , since it is in the underground lots , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which is always hin@@ dered the construction works , represents a big problem for the Bau@@ tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the mot@@ orists in front of red lights and barriers is already enormous , &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the line buses be eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been busy working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were quite ti@@ ring .
&quot; but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with bold mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
&quot; if Bar@@ dina cooked the dinner , she uses a stove . &quot;
it even uses only rarely a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ age in the un@@ quiet in@@ don@@ esian province Pap@@ ua , puts the house@@ wife normally a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the shor@@ tened bu@@ ds will be taken away and dev@@ out , un@@ ri@@ fied hands . &quot;
&quot; Deg@@ ree sits on the Leh@@ ism - it has no furniture - where she also performs their daily work , e.g. clothes with cold water from the nearby sw@@ amp to wash . &quot;
a bu@@ cket in a homeless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of their man their man were assigned to their fields .
Poly@@ gam@@ ie is common here .
&quot; of course , too late can be dangerous : most vill@@ men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody knows it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , as only 1,0@@ 26 el@@ dest by a public h@@ ander@@ thal in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , tou@@ ching the independence against the Dutch rule , turned out quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta which holds control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal experiments . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is ö@@ de . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a mor@@ ale 5 @-@ hour drive with car .
there are no public transportation .
&quot; the city with approximately 19.@@ 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo @-@ fence , and from cor@@ rug@@ ged parts , which were converted by R@@ ost in various yellow @-@ brown sounds . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esian have made their journey here , wei@@ gh@@ ed because journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , the Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans had a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says Deg@@ ei and points to their lively , handmade tur@@ ban , her dark Shirt and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier , we only had leaves to our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is an Indon@@ esian province where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and liter@@ acy rates .
but it is also Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high ground in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort took place in the value of 3,@@ 1 billion US dollars gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources has a value of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , this rich@@ es are however a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure the Indon@@ esian military is a reduced presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local dairy and units were paid to almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars in a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ anic demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are being treated gn@@ y .
&quot; according to information of activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been for@@ ested since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military . &quot;
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as stem es@@ hoch@@ land in 1970 @-@ 18 years were elected to genocide Commission in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone the Indon@@ esian police have more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the past year .
&quot; we value All &quot; &quot; means it in a report of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane from the year 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are , such as un@@ legal Hin@@ du and torture , and electro@@ attacks are particularly popular and the brutal precip@@ itation demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week will happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have reinforced , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources have a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indon@@ esian . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is too 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development is changing , since Muslim economic migrants are changing from the populated islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung cant@@ ines sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , served a mixed vegetables with mineral sauce . &quot;
local people fight for staying here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ local , who moved to the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the M@@ om Mama , and the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - its market . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , in the crowd and as Jo@@ kov@@ i , spoke to the ine@@ qualities and the right @-@ wing violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign . &quot;
the former car@@ ded 27 of the total 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jo@@ kov@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months to Jo@@ kov@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali as two Indon@@ esian soldiers on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the dried children told them they should turn their proj@@ ectors .
&quot; one of the soldiers took An@@ ash to her tone , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had dr@@ unk , j@@ ailed , and sm@@ ote the group with their gun , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then killed one of the soldiers into the group of children .
&quot; one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard be@@ aten that he fell into the coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby governmental commission was set in fire and the things were escal@@ ated on the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football ground in front of the local police station and the military kom@@ mand@@ o@@ center to demand justice . &quot;
they bore the cerem@@ onial hunting ar@@ ches and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ singing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago trunk .
some demonstr@@ ators began to lean stones on police and military post .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers was sent an order via an internal radio : &quot; &quot; if the masses are more than three times resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; means it is not released in an official document of T@@ IME that has not been released in the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned , I was suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; he said T@@ IME on the veranda of his colour@@ ful painted house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame knows still not , who was filmed , but says that the bul@@ let from the ranks of the soldiers gathered together . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were folded , &quot; adds it . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and sought his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esian only one name , the T@@ IME in d@@ ü@@ ster@@ er mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I have kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the che@@ er @-@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said re@@ por@@ ters that his officers wanted to only secure their station , because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people dro@@ hen to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings arrived only the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks talked to Jo@@ kov@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , a passionate speech in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and fluctu@@ ate , the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like that this case is immediately solved , so it will no longer happen in the future . &quot;
&quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he shall set out an extra @-@ judicial mechanism for the assessment of historic human rights violations . &quot;
but the pron@@ unci@@ ation began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most violations have been long ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ ern and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er years .
&quot; the point is that we obliged to join this violations , but there are processes that must run through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with T@@ IME and said , he did not set any plans , in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; alleg@@ edly demanded the UN for crimes against humanity , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua had already been attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ers .
&quot; I have been inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he is still living in fear for years later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have fear , to be arrested by the military , have fear to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeti@@ tive the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was be@@ aten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ wer@@ ies have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , died a person and 17 others were wo@@ unded , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year r@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when he was fis@@ her in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
Ascen@@ ded vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office office .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers were stones on officers , that re@@ acted upon them by hum@@ idi@@ nuts . &quot;
but indigenous people say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot and shot a t@@ öt@@ ete .
&quot; we were so in panic , we have fear that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i , who was near the hospital lives and witness how the last one is delivered here quickly , so the T@@ IME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to withdraw the officers and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a we@@ ather@@ land for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of sensu@@ al development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ bes@@ men Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green Highlands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many adher@@ ed to the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebellion of the rebellion which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by rel@@ ying spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of in@@ don@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to that in recent years , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and arbitr@@ ary into awareness , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; securing of national sovereignty . &quot;
some dive never again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of Sweet potato .
keeping most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces Not@@ a precious only 10,000 Indon@@ esian R@@ up@@ ien ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants are grown since the opening of new flight gro@@ oves to the airport Nab@@ ire in greater numbers . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs which exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and prosp@@ erous migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own business competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , the restrictions of reporting international media remain tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ zes and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission to the movies . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jo@@ kov@@ is electoral campaign , to raise the limitations of reporting , to promote transparency and development , not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indon@@ es@@ iens un@@ ser@@ ene provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua , saying : visa denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in March , six Pacific States - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , the &quot; various and widely spread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai sh@@ ot@@ echni@@ cal . &quot;
the same countries historically saw the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r , dismis@@ sed the demonstration of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there is free media , making it difficult to waste the evidence of human rights accidents . &quot;
people on site want to take note of more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ amb@@ assador K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th visited , bra@@ ins their silence and penet@@ rated him &quot; We want Freedom , &quot; in accordance with a source that also wishes to participate in the meeting , but to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has given us a further presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua will say that they are probably not going to vote for Jo@@ kov@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ kow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jo@@ kow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a Hebrew military , in arm@@ our educ@@ ator and health services . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , their voice for Jo@@ kow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; he must return . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ offering a last symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the body of an op@@ fers was buried on a site precisely opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they may know that they might not come out justice , but at least they do not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a little head . &quot;
&quot; what can we do anything else ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrapers of Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai its flow @-@ book and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ stor@@ ey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second brand that is set up in just two years by the high @-@ house , which one gets fal@@ si@@ sted the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evac@@ u@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we are up in the fire @-@ war@@ nings , and in writing the people . &quot;
&quot; we burned down the staircase , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor to bottom , &quot; told a resident who had his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting for 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building were cool .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
&quot; incident can be used to protect materials security , which are used in outer areas of sky@@ scrapers around the world . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage caused by the cl@@ adding , the outside clothing to decoration or isolation . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police , they believe that the system of plates to insulation and disgu@@ ise at the London Gren@@ fell tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a Bran@@ des , with which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : continue Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis courts ( IT@@ F ) has fallen with its big Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the AG@@ M .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h city was supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single only on two winn@@ ings to play , Hau@@ ch@@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; this is often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ set @-@ classics remain the traditional place so far . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only almost missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but we are disappointed that our members are not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on to improve the application .
&quot; not only for the vote had come before , after many impressions before , the proposal had come to place the final on a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists are in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in future , in the first round the hosts have the right . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the cost of the organizer , the requirements for training rates , etc . , and the players will be made before the Davis Cup less official media appointments . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers , bot@@ tom@@ ed items in the plane will find a survey . &quot;
&quot; a survey among passengers said that more than 20 percent are aware of or un@@ aware items to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , while acci@@ dentally r@@ ored knife , or other objects with blade . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent argu@@ ed , they would have discovered that they should have traveled with fire@@ arms , am@@ muni@@ tion or explo@@ si@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the survey with more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a Jet @-@ charter service , the STR@@ ATOS Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , carried out also firmly that younger travellers are more ab@@ used the rules . &quot;
&quot; by the respon@@ dents , the evidence that they have wis@@ ely tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , was 19,@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common items , which have been pur@@ pos@@ ed to T@@ SA agents , were food and liqui@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent , knowing that acci@@ dentally have borne objects with blade by the safety control , while 2.4 per cent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents were also confirmed that they might have inten@@ tional drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said , it has questioned travelers in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ are brought through the airport safety and how many it could be done . &quot;
&quot; it is not a surprise that men , the most sought sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ os@@ ware - wis@@ ely or un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly - through security , those were most frequently flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company shows that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
the people are often uns@@ ure which liqui@@ ds take them or how much of it .
so it is not a surprise that the largest quantity of the T@@ SA is conf@@ isc@@ ated items found .
&quot; a time long thought people , the T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods . &quot;
&quot; liqui@@ ds are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k it is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers cancel order
&quot; electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gives you the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; model 3 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has under@@ signed that a part of the customer has re@@ trac@@ ed their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the continually tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s numbers to lower sales expansion and even gigantic sales aim , Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has been able to bet@@ ray the recent quar@@ terly balance for the first time : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k was often applied in recent months with the more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery begins . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k is one : from the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders have been returned to 63.@@ 000 already . &quot;
critics always noted that it is only about non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; during a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at present , 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations before , Mus@@ k Mus@@ k is at a phone conference with an@@ al@@ ysts . &quot;
&quot; that the cancellation of so far around twelve per cent of all orders could become a problem , the Tes@@ la boss believes . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth aim is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
in the past year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles delivered .
&quot; 2018 - all models have been assembled - 50@@ 0.000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obviously there .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , per day 1800 reservations are coming to . &quot;
&quot; who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; should be reck@@ oned in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to go his nag@@ el@@ new , nor in practice tested production roads without major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum util@@ isation . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to major delays , then the imp@@ lication of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company can not prevent un@@ satisfied customers from doing so in scar@@ ves . &quot;
EPA Chef Pru@@ denti@@ al draws itself to reduce emissions from the rules of the Obama @-@ Era to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after having passed from 15 states , Scott Pru@@ itt , the boss of the environ@@ ment@@ ing authority , his former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of Obama era to reduce emissions smo@@ g caused air pollution . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt presented the changes , as its agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities towards re@@ orientation faster than previous administr@@ ations . &quot;
he did not mention the law@@ suit against his previous passage in a federal law .
&quot; it is a deadline , which ran on 1 October for states to keep the standards of 2015 for land @-@ down o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; reported in June , that he will delay the compliance with a year in order to give more time to study the plan and avoid taking place in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp Public Prosec@@ ut@@ or of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , has been a reliable opponent for environmental protection rules . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , Pru@@ denti@@ fied has repeatedly led to block regul@@ ators or hes@@ itation to counter the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the Pru@@ denti@@ al roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month a federal Court made in Washington decided that the EPA administration has exceeded its authority than he tried to re@@ delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas enterprises for monitoring and reducing meth@@ an@@ lec@@ ks to delay . &quot;
&quot; in one of the national evening , Pru@@ denti@@ al , Pru@@ denti@@ als proposed that its revers@@ als at Oz@@ on@@ standards is quite easy to ensure the willingness of EPA in cooperation with the complex process of timely meeting of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not observed the deadlines for the implementation and then waiting to set up by activists groups and others , and in an agreement to set up the date for the implementation , &quot; said Pru@@ denti@@ fied that EPA has accused more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority , which there is us serious . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA announces that Pru@@ itt eventually made its &quot; authority for delay and all other legally available enforcement , &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the republi@@ cans of the Congress are pushing for an exhaus@@ tive re@@ fr@@ ame@@ works of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; one in the last month approved , the implementation of the rules of 2015 should be delay at least eight years . &quot;
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York General @-@ state @-@ state @-@ state Eric C@@ der@@ man , who had led the coalition of the states that fought the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and security of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans which flows directly from the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot;
&quot; new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ esota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil o@@ zone arises if poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil radi@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere on sunlight . &quot;
the ent@@ our@@ able smo@@ g can cause sensitive groups of people serious respir@@ atory problems and every year to thousands of premature death cases contribute .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on Pru@@ denti@@ al lessons .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this rational step by the responsible person responsible for the protection of air that we can breathe in , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot;
&quot; we need to continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government , focusing on pollution and their special interests . &quot;

society wants to check the approval of win@@ dr@@ yers
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim w@@ ren is not a legal prerequisite for the construction , and therefore has turned towards the country . &quot;
the club &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim w@@ vered &quot; has been promp@@ ted by Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved as at the time in Vier@@ sen just at the border of the Schwal@@ m@@ tal @-@ valley .
&quot; within this conc@@ ent@@ ment zone construction and operation of wind turbines are fundamentally possible , at the same time the concentration of concentration , but a exclusion of wind turbines for the other city area . &quot;
&quot; the zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided not only a few days before a change in the bott@@ len@@ ding zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , but did not appro@@ ve the district government in Düsseldorf , because of a mou@@ error . &quot;
&quot; by the lack of planned legal prerequisite , the approved authorization is un@@ constitutional and therefore also to increase , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
current status of things : the City Council had once again decided in front of the summer break again the Wind@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a approval of the District government is still off .
&quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; &quot; thus , at this point the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been received at the district of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; stated a speaker . &quot;
&quot; the circle takes it to the occasion , the matter again to review . &quot;
&quot; however , they probably do not expect that the procedure is stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view of the ongoing proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday did not want to speak to the argum@@ entation of the Club &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four per 200 meters high winds . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the company had participated in which the city of Vier@@ sen is involved , pun@@ ched agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of great money . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of approximately 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the electricity demand of all four households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer Vier@@ sens Town entered green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen and a stake in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cr@@ ashes together : woman dies in horrible accident
one terrible traffic accident has occurred on the Friday morning at 10 am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ w ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman has been fatal .
two more people have been in@@ ju@@ red .
the state road remained locked over hours .
&quot; according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took home with her car as part of the accompanying driver with her 53 @-@ year mother as the companion of the L 333 in the direction of B@@ oth . &quot;
city and dealers plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region should be re@@ discovering the shopping facilities in the city center in September .
&quot; the commercial club and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th , to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to the shopping stroll into the city center . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the commercial , Christian King , announced , the &quot; home Sh@@ ells &quot; -@@ weekend to sensi@@ tise the customers that offers their own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; according to the market , there is a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their apprentic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center should invite you to &quot; &quot; Mid@@ night Sh@@ ells &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the activity aims not only to residents of the city and the surrounding region .
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bag that point to the Ak@@ tions weekend , as Christian King . &quot;
municipal administration and commercial club cooperate with the industrial and commerce of Commerce .
&quot; thus , the commercial club and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers like the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv @-@ Day &quot; &quot; for Brun@@ nen@@ fest , with sold @-@ to @-@ day Sunday , conversations with all the commercial and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the delay on parking fees at this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potenti@@ als should be renewed again and again . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
&quot; but also many locals would have lost the city center when shopping from the view . &quot;
&quot; in the end , all would have to contribute to the city center - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it gel@@ te , to overcome with a network the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , which have done partly , had King in spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Strei@@ ch , Leit@@ ner of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Müh@@ l@@ hausen divided with that the third &quot; &quot; home Sh@@ ells &quot; &quot; day , for the first time five Thur@@ ingi@@ an cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ lighter . &quot;
&quot; the day sol@@ ves &quot; for the appreciation of the local trade and make its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; Strei@@ ch . &quot;
the action under spring leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment themselves .

Tru@@ mp set out according to sear@@ ched tran@@ scri@@ bed by phone call Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription by phone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tru@@ mp requested in a phone call with the Mexican presidency En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president im@@ pris@@ oned him , because he had publicly declared the wall publicly . he said to him , &quot; &quot; this can not tell you the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp launched its presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall to the southern border of the USA , and fluctu@@ ate , Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; , &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; be , &quot; &quot; mies , &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; he would look like a &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; , &quot; after having suggested a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the USA . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call , after having said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford @-@ Mass@@ aker : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury was driven by a group of spect@@ ators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men joined forces to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a needle strike - took a long train at its cigarette and looked after by the wind@@ shield .
inside we@@ ars the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; brood the man . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; scre@@ ams the silence , as a young black man from the passenger seat was broken . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this horrible scene , which was played on 22 July , only a post office . &quot;
&quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck by &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all in the audience is very real si@@ gh . &quot;
since 2005 St@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge back to im@@ itate the night in the two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever indic@@ ted for the murder .
&quot; it truly is un@@ constitutional that in all these years no one person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps in the organization of post @-@ performance . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year former official member of the State of Georgia and a life long bro@@ kers .
&quot; for him , the post@@ uring act as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the mon@@ ro@@ e community , that a injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want to pro@@ secution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
an Jur@@ ists over@@ looks a beg@@ to@@ wel on the cor@@ ks of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford Lyn@@ ne on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI @-@ Ak@@ ten , which were obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding county in the Lyn@@ ch@@ ement process were suspic@@ ious . &quot;
but none was ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on free foot for decades , citizenship , that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch &apos;s actions were always known all over the city : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to finish their voice in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as choosing st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ächter Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - supposedly due to a woman . &quot;
&quot; Bro@@ oks said , the ru@@ mor in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy , and that the baby who contributed her , not by her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from the prison so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Murray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
&quot; but when they removed himself from the prison and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge closer , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b das car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison that has prepared and arranged the Mor@@ rison , closes this from a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a completion between the state and local criminal proceedings , which was not only involved in the murder , evidence and identi@@ fies the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks it form@@ ulates it still conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a voting right @-@ mass@@ acres , &quot; said he . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; when you register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade of the Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual post@@ position of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; their presentation is vivid , gri@@ pping and is founded in a kind of deep racism , by which many believe he does not exist in America . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to look and look even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x , because we then are confronted with its h@@ äs@@ s@@ ability in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and the first day , almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of Schwar@@ ze - in a room and lou@@ dly , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ liked overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ate Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss @-@ C@@ lan@@ co gli@@ eds for years , but he said , the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story on life , because we would not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand of the room tried the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester and pus@@ hes him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , lost from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ down the fire .
there is a rest .
and then everyone stops ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at lau@@ est .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still po@@ unding . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos;@@ n --- he said .
&quot; but , funny one of the other black performer . &quot;
&quot; you only need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and exactly there is the energy in the room , a sense of compani@@ onship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this right , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four tag@@ ged people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona the N @-@ word says , he says it sharp and with post @-@ pressure . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
these re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are mess@@ enger , nuts and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , with a trau@@ ma dress , is about the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads to Bil@@ ly Holidays trau@@ ging lob@@ ite &quot; &quot; Str@@ ange Fru@@ it &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it there is a group of about four dozen spect@@ ators swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost even@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , enriched to see the performance , many come only down the road . &quot;
&quot; they all have almost eight hours of Georgia , when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point , the Mor@@ de has remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote but now , if you found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de workshop took place , the air feels at table . &quot;
&quot; sound the last notes of the song , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ects the cor@@ ch@@ name . &quot;
&quot; children are ho@@ cks at their heads , sign the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ dered a little boy , as if he wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope away and wi@@ pe their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the C@@ lan@@ a member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ ded two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks into their arms , the emotional load of the performance break after him . &quot;
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ed one of women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this out of a reason . &quot;
later the audience turns together with the actors for dinner together .
&quot; to a table , a white pair of Atlanta stimul@@ ated over the post @-@ performance with a black couple that she has just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought hard to find words which feeling the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... by people who look like yourself and do that , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what that really does with me can I believe that the Lyn@@ x goes still further , &quot; she added , &quot; today that is called the police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks farm holds at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the citizens &apos; rights . &quot;
he said he has begun to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the post @-@ position is inspiring in a certain way , because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have to bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ an@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth &quot;
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work sets director Frank Cast@@ orf on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging in front of gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the rotating stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows a s@@ hab@@ by street with a wall rest and d@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; &quot; logo from GDR @-@ times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;

&quot; stu@@ ff@@ ed oil f@@ ty remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - which draws itself through his &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; st@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ tones - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl , and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; later , even Gun@@ ther ( Markus Ei@@ che ) must not believe . &quot;
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
&quot; turbul@@ ent , Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who for@@ ks themselves hum@@ ble and the hands on the Merkel noise . &quot;
great appl@@ ause are available for the play@@ sites which shows itself on stage for the first time - given the big heat back into a casual wear .
&quot; with tension , the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf was expected and his registr@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a gell@@ on @-@ concert in 2013 , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing in which the ver@@ aged &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be happy .
&quot; one notice that the audience has grown with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf but it is also an understanding of its perspective .

&quot; in a social year , there is a social year , there is a glimp@@ se since it can see how it is on site , in the fuel point perhaps too , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
&quot; I will be dual , most likely in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social job training and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not something unusual during the Vol@@ unte@@ er Service can have several different types of application ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it is always coming to where you will be F@@ S@@ J .
one can do it from Alter@@ sheim to Ju@@ gen@@ dar@@ work - in all kinds of fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was exactly the right thing that has left me . &quot;
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really is going .
different than in the construction @-@ engineering study ?
&quot; quantity : na clear , here it is not about to reck@@ on st@@ atics . &quot;
there are still other people in front of each other and have a very different story behind .
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been fet@@ ched from the family - you always have to respond individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no tou@@ ching ?
quantity : for this I am not the type .
there is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , a lot of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but so life is . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son abbrevi@@ ated additional 3,000 jobs and shor@@ tened divi@@ dend , to restore the business . &quot;
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said to Friday , they will build more 3,000 jobs and cut off their stop@@ over by 72 percent as another restructuring programme was launched in order to overcome the pressure with which the company is confronted . &quot;

Kon@@ vo@@ i @-@ attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO @-@ Sol@@ dier killed in sel@@ f@@ ord@@ al
&quot; a self @-@ folder has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , a soldiers of Nato and several other viol@@ ated , say officials . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter may have been in@@ ju@@ red by shared an explanation of Nato .
&quot; confirmed local reports , according to the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h also died three civilians . &quot;
bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday morning a self @-@ ord@@ ained two people close to the Iraqi message in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion of Nato , it is said to happen the blast on Thursday night , when a joint pat@@ rou@@ ille with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; of people &quot; com@@ mander &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement poss@@ essing that all the final in a stable state are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital in the air@@ dre@@ ram .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , which is known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there was at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
late July there was a su@@ ic@@ ide @-@ high@@ om@@ be at least 30 people in an mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they would have done this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , there was a huge bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ run troops in 2001 had suffered from power . &quot;
&quot; the violence underlines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering the number of U.S. troops , the military and police in the country to increase . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the sel@@ f@@ ord@@ ings in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA takes a decision on the delay of the smo@@ g rule after cl@@ ams
&quot; the US @-@ American environ@@ ment@@ ing authority has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , stres@@ sing what the states are obliged to penet@@ rate the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this took place a day after 15 states the Agency for the step def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ cology 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the commitment of the agency , with states to work together . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA @-@ Chef Scott Pru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ pr@@ elo@@ aded in June the intention of EPA had to be measured in a part of the country of poll@@ ut@@ ations , where inc@@ isions must be made to maintain stric@@ ter air standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the Colombia district , rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ed on Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to withdraw a wide range of environmental standards , which is imposed by the former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , which should boost the economic growth , according to Tru@@ mp &apos;s economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have triggered the impact of Democrats and nature groups that worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website tells you that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; lung function &quot; &quot; and can reinforce the breathing symptoms &quot; as for example as@@ thma . &quot;
municipal office wants common space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the municipal council decides the establishment of a common area in the future seniors . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement was signed for the still missing property , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it is still going to last until the so far the parish community is in the common property , but there is now no planning stage for that of a private investor to st@@ em@@ ental project . &quot;
there is a discussion regarding a common area .
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered the community to come . &quot;
on the ground floor he would have a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with an additional 70 square meters area for a special price .
&quot; the administration and majority of the municipal council did not take place such a common room , not as a meeting point for the residents of sen@@ i@@ oren@@ ette , but open to the congregation . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word made from &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the decision is made by providing funding for the current budget already in the last autumn , through funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is located in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common area would be so reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the decision of the decision to sign@@ aling to the investor that you don &apos;t want to throw him in this regard , that both Satt@@ el@@ - - what the ambient height is reduced - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - what the tracking @-@ height decreases and the construction of economic power - is possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so does not only mean Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this promise . &quot;
if &apos; s helps : unanim@@ ously happens the body .
not so easy it is at the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings with which you are not so much progres@@ sing , so it is now at the common room in the window , she says : &quot; I am hard with it . &quot;
&quot; Yvonne Sta@@ iger refers to the common room , but absolutely against a municipal participation . &quot;
it looks behind it a distor@@ ted sub@@ ordin@@ ances to any case of charge or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface you do not give a grant , but also come to a real , in two @-@ line market@@ able counter , is the counter@@ speech . &quot;
&quot; state &apos;s application , the decision @-@ bearing in accordance with appropri@@ ated , finds three prop@@ on@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; thus , it remains with two counter@@ parts of the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller sum@@ mar@@ ised as follows : &quot; &quot; when we present the decision , we make a giant step to close a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision with car : rad@@ ar is shining on the road
&quot; at the qu@@ itting the road is a 82 @-@ year cyclists at Wednesday in Gar@@ ath by a car and have been severely in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; like the police medium , the 82 @-@ year Langen@@ feld was about 12 o &apos;clock with his bike on the path of the Black Road from the direction of Hil@@ den . &quot;
the Senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road to the Buch@@ hol@@ zer Bus@@ ch .
one in the same direction driving car @-@ guides grant him priority .
&quot; as the Langen@@ felder on the road drove , but he apparently doesn &apos;t think of the traffic . &quot;
he came together with a car that has w@@ alled 66 @-@ year @-@ old support .
the man was shining on the road .
he suffered heavy violations and was brought into a hospital with a retreat .
FC Bayern Munich must refrain from the Super@@ cup to Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund to David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must leave the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel , FC Bayern travels to the first mandatory game of the new season to Dortmund . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the podium .
the personnel recruitment at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 o &apos;clock / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ever bigger .
Trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must refrain into the Du@@ el with BV@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this confirmed the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
&quot; in addition , the Mu@@ ch Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ jen Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance within the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
the last was not good . &quot;
&quot; the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in an performance increase in the first official mandatory game of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great trust that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German soccer wei@@ ght@@ weight draws the fans in their spell .
&quot; the game is sold with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spect@@ ators , divided the Deutsche Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
to w@@ ander in the resin of Stern to Stern
in Har@@ z the nation@@ wide first &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; is to be created .
this plans of the association observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
one Plan@@ etary route is in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; come to the information in need of many Har@@ z@@ visit , was meant to be . &quot;
&quot; he connections nature , science , movement and spor@@ ty performance . &quot;
the members want to place along the planned route and inform on the stars and constell@@ ations .
&quot; during the first phase until 2018 , the association is planning to travel well @-@ able installations in five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; ask St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber &quot;
the information on the boards should be added by Internet .
&quot; therefore , at the location of thousands of choice , a good mobile network is playing a role . &quot;
also accessibility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star@@ ring train is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad the observer experience much knowledge @-@ value , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; moreover , they learned why stars different colors would have or why a star has more lumin@@ aire than another , even though it is much farther away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which constell@@ ation will find a chosen star , and when he is best to see . &quot;
the association has already been running in the Berg@@ städ@@ t@@ chen St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 .
the location right in the middle of the National Park Har@@ z is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently they are from there from the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye .
in the uni @-@ town there has been a little simil@@ arity on the initiative of the Förder@@ ver@@ eins Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen since 2003 .
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ all@@ ee that forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ eten@@ weg path leads up to Hain@@ berg and for the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ ie ( municipality Glei@@ chen ) with the planet S@@ edn@@ a . &quot;
the st@@ ables with the different planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Pl@@ uto at the end point - are precisely placed at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth is shr@@ inking as to a ball of 6,@@ 5 milli@@ meter diameter , while the exactly 75 meters from the sun rises to 70 cen@@ timeters . &quot;
the entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light is needed from the sun to the Pl@@ uto about eight hours , ped@@ est@@ rians need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Pl@@ uto . &quot;
ped@@ est@@ rians are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fix@@ tures however would last a half year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a coll@@ isions to staged the most thri@@ lling Box@@ ing in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ trained World Box@@ ing Council , lightweight @-@ champion , the hallway down to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko , the World Box@@ ing organization Super @-@ spring @-@ champion . &quot;
according to Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through a part @-@ part resolution on the former four @-@ divisions Croatian bronze Bron@@ er on Saturday on show@@ time are both fighters members of the top @-@ Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How do you go to you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the pair of photos posi@@ tional , noted Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Climate that would be a possible show@@ down between the fighters the &quot; perfect order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I am ascen@@ ded for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to run on light weight .
and he must move on lightweight weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then fight .
these demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko voted .
&quot; box@@ ing needs this battle . &quot;
&quot; climate asked if it should fight for Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that will fight Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 @-@ pounds debut in this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) which also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight @-@ title in the Forum on 23 September . &quot;
&quot; this battle could take place in Pay @-@ by @-@ View Mode , because all fans have asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and oppressed themselves later to fight for the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he appreciate Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko stayed with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the triple @-@ champion from River@@ side look very slowly , sorry for Mi@@ key ... you just wanted to have the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show stroke , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said they could feel the Mom@@ entum , which was built for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the struggle that must be performed .
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said : &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters and this is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four verti@@ ces to tire @-@ space
during an accident on the A7 were severely in@@ ju@@ red on Thursday afternoon four people .
&quot; according to the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost shortly before the connecting market , probably after an ty@@ re @-@ space control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the passenger hi@@ des to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he sm@@ ashed and then remained on the roof in the GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ STRE@@ IF@@ EN . &quot;
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely in@@ ju@@ red by the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the finishing through the rescue service , the A7 in the direction of the north is locked for about an hour , then the traffic could be guided on the left lane on the accident . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoff@@ mann : &quot; Tri@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
Andre Hoff@@ mann hopes after 2 : 2 to the season open@@ er against Braunschweig that brings the optimization of the def@@ ective formation in Au@@ e points .
&quot; with the first season game , Andre Hoff@@ mann was satisfied with the result , if not the two opponents had been at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we must fit even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defence player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Ore Mountains the Trinity is also to be optimized further .
&quot; and a gate after a release , the For@@ tun@@ es would not want to be more einf@@ ected . &quot;
for the future it will be so that no longer turns out to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line .
Hoff@@ mann is convinced that his crew also comes in preparation for the experiences in preparation with the tri@@ erk@@ ette better than with the four @-@ qu@@ ette .
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoff@@ mann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just finished in the three @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; Hoff@@ mann said . &quot;
&quot; it is a prerequisite , however , that we are even better harmon@@ i@@ ously and we do not afford to make a big mistake in building . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoff@@ mann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; whether you can speak to an un@@ decided by a suspic@@ ious start , I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; but if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the podium , we will certainly be able to speak of a neat season . &quot;
he wanted to know nothing .
&quot; the start into the season I asked only after six to eight players , &quot; said Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the play of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken down because of an im@@ pur@@ ée . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoff@@ mann believes that the players from Au@@ e might even be something fresh , as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a climb in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know as 100 % process where they are currently standing , &quot; says the defense of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; while the guests come from the Rhein@@ land as an easy favorite on Sunday , to the meeting in the last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we left it away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six , blocks , the balance sheet , whose balance sheet is quite positive at just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat from the outset , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chef@@ coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement to meet would be arrogan@@ t and Hebrew . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el will not experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ age tests published
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for the medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Food Safety Authority ( R@@ ät@@ t@@ sm@@ e@@ dic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun with the implementation of tests last year .
&quot; they are supposed to make the assessment of age more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Mig@@ rations Authority ( mig@@ rations ) because of errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees were critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; until today , migrant cases are sent from 6.@@ 8@@ 80 for testing cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person &quot; &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 161 cases , the conclusion that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the age of person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are resistant in recent months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; said the Journal The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person has been judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests , and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that they suggest that the person sear@@ ched person 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det obtained the 5@@ 81 published results , they stated that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that they will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in the x @-@ rays of past@@ ors @-@ teeth and MR@@ T recordings are analysed , which are then analysed by dentists and radi@@ ologist , was also cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; scep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work consists of assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went earlier or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we cannot say it sure , we should not do so as if we could it , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge one child as an adult . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk lies in it when the person is just under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in plan
working on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tons of emphasis was installed at the bridge on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , buil@@ ders in the department of road transport and traffic in the ruling class Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April the work began at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , at all three sandy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is planned for October and is sure that the schedule will be respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge of concrete , which is dressed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
built in the year 1900 .
&quot; as the other bridges also , it is now coming into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly mod@@ elled . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ re on the north side , a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so called ro@@ cking cap . &quot;
this is a boundary attachment that is also used as a business path .
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , it is supposed to be used on Friday a most remote meter width . &quot;
it will then take place on the pedestrian road .
&quot; the special thing is that it is about manufacturing parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented rolls .
particular finger@@ tips has to put the wir@@ ing of cables by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a glass @-@ fibre , where many firms are connected . &quot;
the inhabitants were informed about the project in advance of the works .
&quot; moreover , first of all fish and canc@@ ers had to be destroyed . &quot;
for the bridges between the building and the collective in direction Sch@@ ram@@ berg is regulated by traffic lights .
&quot; for the construction at the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher local entrance , the road is locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three br@@ ück@@ els is up to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest at German potato salad
&quot; it does not occur so frequently that parties go to a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes together , what else is hard to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the represented parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad coalition , which shows on this day peaceful flag , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell for the loud poster &quot; large electoral pr@@ el@@ ude . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , which forms the top @-@ duo with Alexander Gau@@ land for the German Bundestag on 24 September , and the Deputy Head of The Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D trucks , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colour@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now taking place at the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that has to offer .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum The World and one of the leading organizers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police led many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the train station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ ro@@ st volcano @-@ fel he has tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked at first in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built @-@ built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; looking at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ pre@@ platz , says : &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : against 20 clock provides a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the rh@@ ein @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D leader Uwe boy . &quot;
&quot; in the hall , about 200 listen@@ er , who are waiting for the leaders of the German Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and dep@@ uty chief vice president Beat@@ rix from Stor@@ k to hold their speeches . &quot;
&quot; unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour will take the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is short after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can move - no special requests .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re @-@ hearing with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ ster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the Klo@@ ster@@ Church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov there is a concert under the motto &quot; Black@@ meer &quot; &quot; meets the Black Sea &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ ine &quot; &quot; meets a classic German training with roots in brass music . &quot;
&quot; both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions , and have Sol@@ op@@ osi@@ tions in European nickname . &quot;
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Con@@ cert@@ geb@@ ouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of SWR Symphony .
&quot; both united the desire , not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the limits of different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; it sounds like Johann Sebastian Bach with the two as in a new gar@@ b , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; united with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ str@@ ä@@ gers N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram , mix classical , jazz and free games to a fascinating visual work . &quot;
this core piece of the program was only listed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram was written for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ ster@@ kirche is fully involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese , and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; says Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art quite openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; if I go once in gri@@ lled cheese , I think &quot; &quot; Oh it was cool , what comes as neighbour ? &apos; . &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of the Holl@@ y@@ ur@@ stars was the to their &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; -@@ colleagues Robert Patt@@ in@@ son who was ultimately bitter apart .
&quot; despite all the br@@ anded Dar@@ stell@@ er towards the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in everyone seriously temp@@ ted to have I remembered . &quot;
&quot; or do you think about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after its separation was Kri@@ sten to that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual , &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and seriously believed in it . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; I just liked it , not seriously , not to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; especially amongst them , they did according to &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; but at school time when they prefer like a bu@@ b , &quot; not all the girls are typical girls . &quot;
it really has been very in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; when I was eleven my children , I would like to look like a bu@@ b . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , fri@@ ghtened and damaged . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think I : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public they don &apos;t like to live their love life : &quot; people expect you to see you in a certain way and be anno@@ yed me .
&quot; and perhaps some may call me a few things , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said governor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking about ... today I will say you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic Gover@@ nor . &quot;
the r@@ ally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the republi@@ cans , &quot; &quot; Justice &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp spoke a great announcement in the West Virginia r@@ ally .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not deny the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , which is according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes believes that he has inherited K@@ ohl@@ em@@ inen in five states , and I inherited an carbon @-@ business from his father . &quot;
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; meanwhile , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening took a statement on Thursday night in which it said : &quot; &quot; the Party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a democr@@ acies that would be more than to work than to do our country again magnificent . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 gou@@ vern@@ s and control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is the last ref@@ us@@ al of a party which is from top to bottom without a guide and is unable to find a positive , satisfactory message , &quot; said R@@ NC @-@ Chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ e lo@@ ops &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the global leader of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday , what he described as an open ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal but he repeated , unless the moment for the country to be recorded in sports . &quot;
&quot; Russia Ath@@ le@@ tics head Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress at the eve of Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he decided to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes , those with competitions of gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite its comments the IA@@ AF Congress was voted for the maintenance of the prohi@@ bitions , which was issued in November 2015 after a report in the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) references to state dop@@ ing dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was today a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has been aware of herself , that she has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; he said , he also enjoys &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia will accept the criteria for his re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the principle principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ zed system , &quot; he added
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start at the athle@@ tics World Championships , which start Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday , that Russia still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still under inadequate and bot@@ tom@@ ed trainers are still working freely , he said re@@ por@@ ters in London after a presentation at IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
trau@@ mat@@ act for in Mali ab@@ ed soldiers
&quot; in a grape @-@ party in the Nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ische Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two were taken with a helic@@ opter in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt .
to still un@@ enligh@@ tened abor@@ tion said Defence Minister Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) nothing .
&quot; they referred to the two rec@@ essed pil@@ ots , but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their specialist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we tend to be before this highest victim , which they have produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year major and the 47 @-@ year old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen were born on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their sco@@ oters were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a total @-@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at noon we first took only the relatives in the church goodbye .
&quot; after that , the dream party began in the circle of family , closest friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot;
below were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the Direc@@ torate General of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; grape @-@ ni@@ sts laid down ro@@ ses , the families had an arm in arm to the har@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers had the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; defense of the Ley@@ en marked the um@@ bel@@ ated soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and s@@ quar@@ ed . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operation of the Kampf@@ h@@ ub@@ ber Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger drivers of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Kom@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the Reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers belong to the soldiers , stated : &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , then there would be no inter@@ rup@@ tly . &quot;
doubts about the UN Mission in Mali did not show minister from the Ley@@ en : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high significance &quot; for a country from which we are separated only through two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the dream party the sc@@ iss@@ ors were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information . &quot;
Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik is not a grave beside his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried after his death in addition to his wife . &quot;
the reign of the Royal House on Thursday with .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish king is attached to the church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard fer@@ ed already a Sar@@ k@@ op@@ ag for the two .
&quot; the Queen may not agree with the decision of their man , it was called on the message . &quot;
&quot; where prince Hen@@ rik buried , be still unclear . &quot;
but he did not have the intention to be set aside in his French home .
prince Hen@@ rik never had a dog of it that he was not happy with his title .
after the thr@@ ust of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to become king .
&quot; in 2016 he went to retirement and also puts the title &quot; &quot; prin@@ cess &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he considers himself not as equal to his wife - also not after death , the ball@@ son , the Chief of the Danish king &apos;s house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old , will be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not have the intention to be set aside in his French home , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the land for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ ocr@@ at , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked on the Thames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later woman the sympath@@ ies of the people had always been for@@ ged , Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in its almost 50 years of age . &quot;
in a auto@@ biography of Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did .
&quot; my Danish was swe@@ ar , I preferred wine instead of beer , Seiden@@ str@@ ings instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoke in instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and having had the reputation to be the brand of soci@@ opoli@@ tical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not as@@ ham@@ ed me .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift new election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; defe@@ ats Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of red @-@ green Regi@@ stry is for a quick re @-@ election of the country @-@ day , but he does not want . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of Friday for the resolution adopted by the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising resign@@ ation of a Green S &amp; D members had led the government of Prime Minister in Nieder@@ sachsen the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a heavy crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official appointment of the country @-@ election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover thus lost its scar@@ ce a @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Gre@@ et El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ al became a part of their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for choosing 2018 in their electoral circle in Rot@@ enburg ( Des@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
&quot; Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to his group , to include them . &quot;
&quot; there@@ with CD@@ U and F@@ DP have worked together 69 seats in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new country tag will be elected regular on 14 January the next year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state governments now decide whether they could continue in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l does however , however , considers that the country decides as quickly its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on Tuesday over their next steps .
the state of state is also the possibility that the country &apos;s country has chosen the prime minister and sel@@ ects a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be checked in a legal basis , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; you will discuss all questions , if they are legally reasonable . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; Great @-@ West &quot; &quot; but somewhat cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
&quot; the political leader himself said , &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
it described as a tr@@ ist of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the lower Euro MPs called on the return of their land @-@ day .
&quot; of course we assume that they received their land @-@ convention , which they receive over the green country list , with immediate effect , the country @-@ CEO Met@@ a J@@ ans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Gre@@ ens Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ west . &quot;
they have chosen to be aware of no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group .
&quot; even before the background that there was no contex@@ tual differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD @-@ pul@@ ch@@ kan@@ did@@ at Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the over@@ head of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green Members El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U as betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens parliament@@ arians in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ y@@ al of the voters , but also betra@@ y@@ al of Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , who quickly choose to choose the country . &quot;
the resign@@ ation of the West @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the political leader of &quot; &quot; in her last erup@@ tion , and in its Fr@@ ust their personal interests above the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ Secretary of Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
&quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony , and tries to beat out of political capital . &quot;
&quot; defe@@ ats Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its members , El@@ ke T@@ west into the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ west before , with personal career re@@ membran@@ ce the result of the country @-@ election of 2013 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the CD@@ U was in front of the SPD the strongest power , SPD and green in the country had a hau@@ ghty majority of one voice . &quot;
&quot; land@@ ings in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ ern , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed beyond si@@ ghing eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
Agricultural Policy Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) stands in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) speech and response .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect against po@@ ison@@ ing eggs ? &quot;
&quot; I can only encourage all the consumer inside and consumer , watching the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp . &quot;
&quot; at the consumer portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information on the affected eggs . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after all we know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; takes over Al@@ di the best possible crisis crisis - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ tening of the federal agriculture is not really perceived ? &quot;
the food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has to be opened immediately and since announ@@ cements of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has just as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold @-@ selling products are busi@@ able and health@@ ful un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able .
&quot; if with eggs of the back@@ stand@@ alone content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not traffic . &quot;
&quot; however , eggs are sold and consumed . &quot;
this time is not the factories to blame .
are manufacturing facilities and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to this knowledge , the production facilities meets no immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , it must be expected due to mut@@ ated illegal practices of service companies with economic damage . &quot;
as always there is a little contro@@ l@@ ure in harvest .
is it only missing on the staff or even at the clever jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , there were just the official controls that have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; however , for truth , food fraud and criminal energy cannot be ruled by 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; this is why a consistent clarification of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases , in which criminal off@@ ences are able to be of crucial importance . &quot;
&quot; I have already done several times , that I expect a seam@@ less education by the responsible authorities . &quot;
is the regular alarm clock in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and busi@@ able foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ related insec@@ ti@@ cide is employed in the food sector , consumers and consumers are rightly ou@@ trag@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; by the bre@@ aded means manufacturers , distributors and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cides Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food supplies is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
it must be consistent at all levels and worked with high pressure .
&quot; I expect of all the competent authorities , that the experts will be quickly and fully covered . &quot;
how the financial rules of the Football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules , which aim to prevent un@@ controlled issues of European foot@@ football , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , as the executive organization that monitors the European game has super@@ vised power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were brought in 2011 by UEF@@ A UEF@@ A , that PS@@ G must show some point out that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without large losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to recover the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will be several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make sure the money is able to make money , lest N@@ ey@@ mar and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy rich mi@@ scher@@ family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; one may contact a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must be controlled with legitimate res@@ sources , which allow them to allow the Bre@@ ak @-@ E@@ ven point in their on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that in their pursuit of success , enormous debt had taken on himself , effectively fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ously and ris@@ ky to ruin , when banks or owners moved their support . &quot;
in 2011 FF@@ P from concentration on the debt of clubs to monitor their losses .
&quot; the amendment meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ amo@@ vi@@ ch was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then strongly investment to build the team and build a global brand - become a tough@@ er matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P processing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini 2015 was like by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , its UEF@@ A successor Alek@@ s@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to cry out from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will still reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so that is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G paid the Buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of its contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year agreement so that the read@@ ability for the next five years can be transferred to the annual financial statements for the next five years .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has won the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a borro@@ wed of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the teams will be limited to the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players remains limited . &quot;
UEF@@ A is searching for clubs that could try to over@@ hau@@ l their financial supervision by connected their revenue by companies who are connected to the owners of a club .
&quot; during a cat@@ ar@@ ical company the PS@@ G spon@@ ges , if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not apply this as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; it was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to N@@ ey@@ mar on payments of the Organis@@ ational Committee of the World Championship in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Kat@@ ar 2022 have been disp@@ uted that N@@ ey@@ mar WM &apos;s amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will simply be able to find out for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive , every attempt to consider the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A UEF@@ A has no pre@@ condi@@ tional talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , say on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not be@@ fu@@ eled to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
&quot; the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated sales of 54@@ 2,@@ 4 million euros a profit of more than 10 million euros . &quot;
the accounts for the last fiscal year must be published yet .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing @-@ De@@ als , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot@@ ics . &quot;
the association goes out that sales after signing at least 30 percent will rise .
&quot; the Spanish League was clear to see one of the best football players , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Weg@@ zug , by asser@@ ted that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financing dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; said the President of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar latter , to PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and it has completely changed the entire landscape of the foot in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play , because you have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new ch@@ og@@ gi@@ ants

no@@ stalgia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nost@@ alg@@ ically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ er years , for the 90 @-@ er @-@ years of the State &quot; &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to larger things . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time would be tight .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly good , not just because of his absur@@ den Hum@@ ors ( it enth@@ s a original story for an speaking d@@ ants vegetable that was talked by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by changing the core of the g@@ ags - actor middle ages play intellec@@ le children , who will grow to grow - they still managed to win the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the w@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , with his adult , which now play adults , is less emotional , and his par@@ ody goes more after the found@@ ly known principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker @-@ Films of the 90 @-@ er years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cr@@ adle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand , who looked at the cradle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at a point , a character through a Apple Power@@ book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gr@@ acious co@@ op ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy mal@@ icious P@@ lot that is involved in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the classes are the best part of fran@@ chise .
&quot; it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ illons Unter@@ li@@ ppen@@ bart of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy can now feel like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of random mad@@ ness that could make this fran@@ chise might be like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he achieved this , what I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ ET Hot American Summer : &quot; &quot; his final scene will show the gang &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon now reminds of another kind of no@@ stalgia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; and even an &quot; &quot; G@@ low &quot; &quot; with its East @-@ West E@@ cology . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy drama of Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka has been created with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with both polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , which fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main trop@@ og@@ gles - a hard @-@ work Greg@@ ory and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic j@@ r and Corn@@ eli@@ u , whose di@@ alogs of chann@@ eling Tat@@ um ( also played a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt to be syn@@ ced in English . &quot;
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some nice g@@ ags for watching ( the police spends the time to watch chess on TV , as Americans perhaps do with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including Jenn@@ y S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; fin@@ de &apos; voice . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a du@@ bi@@ ous propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer which is a Re@@ agan mask , is involved - that it is often like a single playing . &quot;
&quot; with six long episodes , it moves to that and the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; which was applied to a lower length , his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re better deliver , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always present the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men , who dev@@ our@@ ing a he@@ ap of Hamburg . &quot;
the message for imag@@ ining communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators are not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
blow against drugs @-@ m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ ora tomorrow in the Black @-@ B@@ aar @-@ Circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects are sear@@ ched as the prosec@@ ut@@ or Con@@ stance on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , 15 alleg@@ edly arrested , aged between 25 and 77 years and was en@@ forced against them in prison . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials presented larger volumes marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundreds of thousands of Euros . &quot;
at the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two suspic@@ ious Itali@@ ans there was German ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
the promotion took part in Italian and Bay@@ erische investig@@ ators .
&quot; in total , more than 300 police officers in action . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia is organised crime crimin@@ ality , severe violence , trying murder as well as rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot;
since summer 2016 the Public Prosec@@ ut@@ or Con@@ stance obtained against organised drug trading in the South German area .
&quot; between the prosec@@ ut@@ ings in Con@@ stance and Palermo consisted of re@@ unification and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; thus , the major use on the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ et will also be accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; into the vision@@ aries of the investigations , mainly Italian national , with respect to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , in the early morning several shots were caught up into a restaurant , is likely to go to the bank account of the Ban@@ de . &quot;
decreased great gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; data from citizens , which should not emerge , &quot; : a report said the foreig@@ ner @-@ Register in Germany has considerable shortcomings . &quot;
lead to partly gra@@ vi@@ ous mis@@ choices at asylum procedures .
&quot; the representative for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen ways , has drawn attention to a media report , according to large gaps in the country @-@ country register . &quot;
&quot; defects in the registered data could result in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; to partly serious failures , &quot; war@@ ned in an analysis that the &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the register of 10 million people with foreign nation@@ als , such as 5,@@ 7 million out of non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data is thus managed by some 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; because the data were not sufficiently well maintained , the data quality in parts so far has not been good . &quot;
&quot; in particular cases data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; from people who have long been no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and are actually no longer to dive in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data inser@@ tions can slo@@ w@@ down significantly slow , &quot; says it to the report after . &quot;
&quot; in statistics about out@@ going people , the EU citizens are taking over , which would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; but such false states led to a distor@@ ted debate on dealing with explo@@ iting , &quot; it is therefore in analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the German government began to return to Italy back to Italy with under 16 @-@ year children if they came from there . &quot;
&quot; this arises from an internal paper of the federal state for migration and refugees ( BAM@@ F ) , the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ re@@ er Zeitung reports . &quot;
&quot; in the paper there is therefore , the BAM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; relating to families with children - except for inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - according to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper in reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees in the EU state that they first reach . &quot;
&quot; if a Mig@@ rant is in a different EU country , this state can withdraw him into the boarding area . &quot;
&quot; for the reason , the office is now : &quot; meanwhile the capacity for families with min@@ der@@ less children in Italy increased considerably . &quot;
Italy made guarantees for the recording and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) keep these commitments for sufficient .
&quot; also , other EU states would return to refugees in the context of Dublin agreement . &quot;
&quot; the interior political speaker of the Lin@@ ks@@ fr@@ action in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , cri@@ tici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children , because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system , un@@ constitutional conditions and a haz@@ ard of kin@@ esi@@ ls . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth , and the weak@@ ening of inflation took over a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England war@@ ned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; income &quot; , &quot; when they arrive interest rates on family members in the midst of an increased pressure . &quot;
&quot; the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates on 0,25 % , with fewer members a rise in this month , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and war@@ ned that the pressure on the budget would continue to rise to almost 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ aled that in the next few years Zin@@ c @-@ caves would be necessary to breed those from the Bre@@ xit , and she said that the credit costs may be more than expected to rise in the financial markets . &quot;
members also voted for this to reg@@ ain a part of the Mam@@ mut &apos;s business package that was published before a year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; it will require time for finance planning to provide funding for banks from the coming February cheap funds for banks , although it is expected that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC remains the gross domestic product ( GDP ) at short notice , because pressure on the realities of the households continues to be charged consumption . &quot;
&quot; to the interest rates repeated them , that &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; to the cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly greater &quot; scale would be required than the markets are expected . &quot;
the markets forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; the Bank stressed , however , that increases &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the last year forecasts 1.9 % and 1.7 % .
it has kept its growth forecasts on 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pounds fell to these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pounds fell by 0.5 % to the US dollars and fell to 0.3 % to 1.11 Euro .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth pay the rising expectations on a Zin@@ c height and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0,@@ 2 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected in the third quarter at 0.@@ 3 % , although it is easy to recover after the Bank by the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the most recent incentive report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by an increasing inflation and low @-@ level hearing , as the se@@ ag@@ eing first becomes worse before they get better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years can not prevent the income tax &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages grew to the end of its three @-@ year progn@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pounds , which is a part of the lower consumption . &quot;
&quot; the decision will be a year after lowering interest rates on 0,25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the decline of the sound . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will be the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the last jud@@ gement of the Bank to the interest rates , the call was increased after a Zin@@ c @-@ cave , since inflation increased pressure on hard over@@ flowing households , with three political decision makers in July to demanded a rise in 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has fallen in the last month of 2.9 % in June to 2,@@ 6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will be re @-@ moving in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said , the crossing in relation to their goal of 2 % be &quot; &quot; very &quot; &quot; to the weak pounds . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; given the recent return of S@@ wap R@@ ates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the cred@@ itors want to search for shops and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market especially looks good for those in which the existing De@@ als run and the new hyp@@ othe@@ ques , and many with toll free options and low pensions are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is to be disp@@ uted by the HIV @-@ drug threat to 10,000 people
&quot; from September after a battle in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; HIV @-@ Pre@@ treatment treatment . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ oxid@@ ation prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the Inf@@ ection risk for around 86 percent , now from the health service on a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after the appeal of the Court of Justice confirmed the authority of the Supreme Court of Justice , that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the latter announced on Thursday , was welcomed by N@@ HS England &apos;s boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an important new intervention , during the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) this was a &quot; decisive moment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ ghton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the First belong to which the registration of people will allow , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre @-@ prevention prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations which are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduces HIV @-@ transmission in infectious diseases .
pre@@ p before intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before intercourse .
&quot; to those who are coming to the treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , appropriate participants are identified to agree with the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status will not be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a home@@ work can sign up for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the supply of medicines in this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by identifying clinical evidence , as it is used in a large scale and is implemented in a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for prevention of HIV supplement and over@@ take . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity .
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p if it is targeted to need@@ y and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled and not with a hearing with a partner , which leads to improving many , many lives . &quot;
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now lie that the study is quickly carried out in the whole country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , since the pre@@ p testing medicine was lab@@ elled , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ in@@ zed people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ Minister of Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p trial is welcome after months of delay and more efficient realization through the government and over@@ due . &quot;
the evidence show how trans@@ forming this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can finish the transmission of this lifetime infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to ending the dissem@@ ination of HIV in society . &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and cl@@ ever@@ e designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court flat into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , smaller in 2014 by a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I sear@@ ched for something that was similar to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high ceilings .
I loved myself in her and made a quote on this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit the 1,000 square meters was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; originally a A @-@ room property with a mer@@ ging layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add to the bedroom and a mezzanine , to make the generous ceiling height . &quot;
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; this was my requirement , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose they commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces over each other , so that the architectural challenge existed in it , to create an interim period in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to consider creative to solve the pres@@ et .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arranged that they were over@@ wel@@ ded , without having had to leave us . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but the steel so that he had the correct height for the function above or down . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement allowed it Er@@ fan , to place two rooms in full height - with much more common drama . &quot;
for the mezzanine a classic coupl@@ ing window looks down from ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ amor@@ ous residential area .
mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver @-@ up and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short cor@@ ridor mir@@ r@@ ored to let him work longer . &quot;
in the kitchen the Mir@@ ror as a window feels like a different room .
at the entrance offer mir@@ r@@ ored units space for all stocks and glasses of yo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
coll@@ ap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage for advertising .
&quot; a bit of engineering , there went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the st@@ ahl@@ reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ fied M@@ DF door . &quot;
&quot; it is quite important , so it when you push the door , very light gl@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the cl@@ ever@@ ly use of space and storage space , yo@@ anne was able to gain extra 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land surface - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate kli@@ fts enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the ground floor and to use high quality materials , which give space to its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you do not ad@@ orable you into the electric plugs in the walls . &quot;
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square met@@ ric number of something by standard into something completely astonishing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollars in imperial
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation because of one of the largest property imperative Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developers Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and its business . &quot;
Paul wanted to withdraw himself from the family business since 2014 but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
&quot; together with her mother Anna , brothers 38 Real Estate have collected a value of more than half a billion dollars , since then the family in 1973 bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the family of West@@ co Je@@ ans founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis comprises offices in the city centre , the development of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the subur@@ ban . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with its dec@@ eased father Col@@ in - by Paul as a &quot; main operator &quot; &quot; and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third . &quot;
a jurisdiction that this means that Col@@ in has property of 316 million dollars and Paul &apos;s value in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash proved to be done for Paul as a problem .
&quot; the proposed by Col@@ in proposed super@@ vis@@ es have left him with what I held for the best objects , he wrote in 2015 in a first affair . &quot;
on the last Friday we took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice .
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , how Paul maintains him out . &quot;
&quot; argu@@ ed , this is not true , but casts Paul before , some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent to manage . &quot;
&quot; in an early affair av@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to set the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost rise in the case with hundreds of sites with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports by companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides of the law firm . &quot;
&quot; Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950 &apos;s years and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
&quot; they used the safety , to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood li@@ thium , opened in the col@@ on the first Je@@ ans@@ wood family . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co , when he was in High School when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their property to their sons in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; Luigi has often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in court , &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis @-@ group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid in leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark , &quot; says Paul &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has declined very back though he was a former AF@@ L board and after a biography in 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated in contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; only col@@ on rep@@ lied by SMS to say , &quot; I really cannot say much , because the case before the courts may be . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to complain and withdraw our family names through the courts , he wrote . &quot;
in the middle of 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our Father would not have wished that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be gone .
&quot; our affair will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s of new Stab@@ sch@@ ef is planning to restrict the Media @-@ Ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried it and are failed .
maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reported that the new Stab@@ ili@@ ef of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow on President Tru@@ mp , including the reports of news media - in the hope to keep the head on an equal course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ por@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new St@@ ef of White House , at his first working day , he held a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House , which he repaired : poor information that get into the hands of the President . &quot;
&quot; Kelly said the collabor@@ ators , that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings , because the President would make better decisions , if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to for@@ ge Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship to television extends decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if the candidate of Tru@@ mp was anno@@ yed because of an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places that were to convince him , &quot; said the former electoral consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; the key , Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit has to hold under control , according to six former electoral officers in it , to ensure that his personal media intake involves a ste@@ er praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit ever &quot; &quot; under control &quot; , &quot; is ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
perhaps this campaign may know something we don &apos;t know - that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twe@@ ets would have not included without their interventions yet .
we will probably never know anything about the Twe@@ ets which has not sent the Tru@@ mp .
&quot; if his staff had managed to maintain it several times , anger from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; but no one has consistently prevented it , that Tru@@ mp contro@@ versy is empha@@ sized . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem consists of that people in a White House , which is composed of competing parties , and again attempt to monitor their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp &apos;s material , which potentially encourages their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants , the President of strategic reasons to per@@ v@@ able information . &quot;
this was an example that was described by re@@ por@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react to negative press releases , especially such with damaged le@@ aks , and that it is going to find out to find out where these come . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February , when someone gave the President mal@@ icious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty bo@@ ots in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap to be of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was ban@@ ished because of Shi@@ kan@@ en permanently from Twitter , or that he has no concrete proof that he has vo@@ iced in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them in the past . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Stab@@ sch@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to dep@@ loy a system to manage the paper@@ work and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did this work out ?
&quot; Kelly is trying to do three months later , the same . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still its impul@@ si@@ ves self , and its consultants are still looking for influence . &quot;
this un@@ change@@ able factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ ges@@ u@@ ated crimin@@ als get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the assistance of the population will pray and hop@@ ed . &quot;
the police in all of Europe are sent in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the sear@@ ched heav@@ y@@ bre@@ cher are not known , they are hop@@ ed from the population and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; &quot; Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; calendar of the winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences had shown that many fo@@ xes hide in vacation sites , it meant by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 post@@ cards have put together 21 post@@ cards for ges@@ ted crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 it has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ab , more than 2.5 million times this has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online stock products were able to be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est house owner of the West Mid@@ lands stand once again with some prot@@ rac@@ ted travel@@ er , which have tr@@ aded one of the congregation to return to a field in front of their manor @-@ houses . &quot;
&quot; the travellers have turned their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of a af@@ flu@@ ent street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transportation after they were rejected only in May , without being de@@ duc@@ ted by one by the Council to prevent their accidents . &quot;
the tak@@ e@@ full group found a gap in the defense units and op@@ ted their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; devast@@ ating inhabitants have ur@@ ges the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &apos; useless be to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; they were taken on the assembly evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they have thrown stones on pas@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced to implement the problem through shame on implementation , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
the travellers were there in May there were moved and are now back .
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy , continue to pay my communities if the Council cannot stop it once . &quot;
&quot; a resident who wanted to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we have just seen the last lap of these travelers , just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
the figures have raised this time and you even have seen a horse in the parking area .
&quot; a speaker of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of a dirt camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to continue as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our evidence collection , it is very important that as many people report a anti @-@ social or criminal conduct in the police by calling it 101 . &quot;
&quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation where the court has to examine , when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Birken@@ hof through the then ambi@@ ance operating company mbH to the 13th of April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights were lost per year and also revenue by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , given dramatically the numbers of refugees that came into the land district , the hotel building the estate office building as a collective accommodation , which cat@@ ered for contro@@ versy discussions . &quot;
the town prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the municipal council .
&quot; but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt @-@ bourgeois Julian O@@ ss@@ wald , defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious clim@@ bers at the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotel with chair@@ men Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof in a voluntary sur@@ au@@ ction in Berlin and want to make it again a house of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus Category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof has been standing in front of the entrance for a longer time , and if one enters the house , clearly , what extensive renov@@ ations will be made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were cut out , blankets to the part , old bath@@ tubs of the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black @-@ style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is designed , new window will be installed . &quot;
&quot; all sol@@ le later &quot; &quot; beautiful &quot; &quot; will be &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expressed . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot;
&quot; at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , you would like to position at the high level of downtown , empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms would be wide open , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or busin@@ ess@@ men are to feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
discussions with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause he already run it so sn@@ ap .
the ideas of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investment asked , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to not determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under a million euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; also the outdoor facilities are placed on the front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard comes a large terrace , which is publicly available from the restaurant which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ affair : us @-@ Special Com@@ er@@ ers sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia @-@ affair , the US President Donald Tru@@ mp is to have cons@@ ulted Robert Mu@@ eller after a report called Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; in the past weeks , the Panel started working in the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under calling on the matter of confidential people . &quot;
the paper valuable the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended his investig@@ ators and intensified .
&quot; the CN@@ N transm@@ itter , it already give the first accus@@ ations of the body related to a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s and Russian lawyer . &quot;
U.S. intelligence agencies complain the Krem@@ lin since longer to have been specifically mixed up in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were talking between Tru@@ mp@@ s electoral team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of investig@@ ators , several men are to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ cans . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Mu@@ eller also accepted more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and busy environment under the magni@@ fier . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special er@@ ler Tru@@ mp was personally placed in the center and I find the draft for whether the president in the course of the affair may hin@@ ders the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and decide on current evidence in possible inter@@ rup@@ tions , and decide whether indic@@ t@@ ment shall be raised . &quot;
Grand Law@@ ys are therefore also called charges .
&quot; mostly they are swit@@ ched on , if it is a greater and contro@@ versy . &quot;
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the panel may also be swit@@ ched from the Public Prosec@@ ut@@ or to submit people to the decre@@ asing under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N &apos;s channel CN@@ N were already issued anticip@@ ations that revol@@ ves around Donald Tru@@ mp j@@ r and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to be a statement called in the report .
&quot; furthermore , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tru@@ mp j@@ r , Tru@@ mp@@ s consultants and swi@@ eg@@ ers@@ ohn Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam@@ aging election Paul Man@@ a@@ continued during the interview . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thurs@@ days in the U.S. television , that Mu@@ eller lay out in his work not shy and that he should be necessary if it should be necessary . &quot;
&quot; but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will turn into the end , to decide on the survey of an indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; however , the submission of the body at the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason to concern President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , President on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia , to present Russia &apos;s affairs as a campaign against his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the topic give the democr@@ ats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else over which they can talk . &quot;
&quot; his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion , he wis@@ se nothing of the establishment of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; however , this work also usually in secret , he stressed . &quot;
&quot; the White House feared all measures , accelerated the work of the special agent in a fair &quot; way . &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI @-@ Chef James Com@@ ey told three times that not to be determined against the President .
&quot; you have no reason to accept that something changed , it meant to be in the explanation . &quot;
&quot; Mu@@ eller had only been used , after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had been filmed . &quot;
&quot; because of this ration@@ ali@@ fs were pre @-@ gr@@ ading against Tru@@ mp , he did not want to hin@@ der the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp was asked for a setting of investig@@ ators against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the study .
&quot; according to the representation of U.S. media , the White House against the Special Com@@ er@@ ers and its employees . &quot;
the cool@@ est spec@@ ulations of whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller can be released .
&quot; unlike an independent special medi@@ ator of Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair concerning the later President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has resign@@ ed a position in which it could theoretically filmed on ur@@ ging of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prev@@ ent@@ able to such a step .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic transm@@ itter set out on Thursday , after which the special medium could no longer be released . &quot;
Antarc@@ tica : giant ic@@ eberg drives in the Antarc@@ tic
&quot; in the West@@ ant@@ ark@@ tis , a giant ic@@ eberg has solved itself from the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Schel@@ sol@@ s . &quot;
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar@@ - and Marine Research on Wednesday with .
&quot; the over a Bil@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres are now driving on the north and I will probably take two , three years until he was mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , one of the largest king@@ doms , researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for people goes out from him .
&quot; in this climate change , climate change has played a role in the break@@ out of the ic@@ eberg , is unclear according to research . &quot;
&quot; however , in total , there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact . &quot;
&quot; according to the opinion of many researchers , this can be combined with the heating up . &quot;
the col@@ abor@@ ted Kol@@ oss has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ s .
Schel@@ sol@@ s flo@@ wed on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
North of this Schel@@ sol@@ ation was the balance of wax and ab@@ ort a few years ago .
&quot; a complete Schel@@ sol@@ i be there , writes AW@@ I researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; I am talking about that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ s in danger , because the pre@@ dere can@@ did have never with@@ drawn so far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice @-@ plate also stand under tension and can fall apart , if at a key post a piece of de@@ br@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ sol@@ s and ic@@ eberg increases the sea level not , since they swim in the water and cast ice so much water as it brings after the mel@@ ting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the Schel@@ sol@@ ation leads to the gl@@ aci@@ ers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea , but only in the sli@@ gh@@ test , writes the British research project for the observation of the Antarc@@ tic ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ s is after AW@@ I @-@ information with nearly 50 000 square kilometres the fourth @-@ largest Schel@@ sol@@ s of the Antarc@@ tica .
&quot; at the junction of the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the edge @-@ edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there is a regular basis .
&quot; though it is a natural happening and we do not make any direct connection to climate change , the ice sign comes into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most comprehensive withdrawal since the beginning of the records , &quot; confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists may now be disp@@ uted , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ s now go back again and maybe together , he said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if this researchers did not lead the break@@ down of this gigantic ic@@ eberg , in recent decades , however , many ice of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula have been torn down in recent decades . &quot;
this long time of the Antarc@@ tic extends towards South America .
&quot; according to data of the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the polar surface of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula since the 1950@@ s has gone back to 28 000 square kilometers . &quot;
for the decline I have contributed to the temperature of temperature .
the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has passed over 50 years by about three degrees warmer and for@@ es with the areas where the temperature at the fastest growing .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f in the personnel
&quot; because it is always more difficult to occupy @-@ clear points , the CD@@ U to res@@ ign from the worker @-@ association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the circle of 41 new places in the administration have gone through . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county seat in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now even 17 trainees have their first working day .
the teacher at the circle are obviously very talented .
some 620 App@@ lic@@ tions were to be recorded for this year in vain places .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continues to be available to meet the increased requirements and tasks . &quot;
currently there is a circle of M@@ ett@@ mann as well as 50 non @-@ connected positions .
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers are used as well as forces of general management . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and take care of the skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the desire of parties , the management aims to work out a concept of recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term needs for specialists , but forward @-@ oriented of the application cr@@ acking . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be based on the inside and outside , to show concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include an educational background , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds already after a good approach .
&quot; because the circle has it to do with a personal problems , which one had not known earlier . &quot;
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is of a regul@@ ating &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or alter@@ ation may be eliminated from the service . &quot;
so the highest time to action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he had long since been in the circle of a lazy surprise , when he publicly asked the personnel @-@ covering publicly and the rest of the parties were aston@@ ished . &quot;
people want to be reviewed all possibilities that allow a resign@@ ation from the municipal worker @-@ association .
&quot; if we come here not at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the county @-@ administration should also seek to work with the unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the circular cities - a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f &quot; , &quot; so peoples . &quot;
&quot; in order to pay the CD@@ U , the employees and officials to pay better than it actually sees the collective service for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money there is only if you change into a higher level that is oriented at work @-@ years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up , in which the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law will take care of . &quot;
&quot; not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ Director Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little personal . &quot;
Italy intensified the tone to NGOs @-@ migrants @-@ lif@@ ebo@@ arding
&quot; Italy , NGOs who use the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ns that they are not allowed to continue to hold on new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs have no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had a boat of the German aid organization &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew had effectively worked with man@@ ners in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the aid organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , followed , to express themselves to detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian State of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us and remains the rescue of human life our top priority . so we are sorry , that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue area , &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can judge all accus@@ ations that are currently raised , only after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; Youth ret@@ ains &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that his crew rel@@ ieve infl@@ atable migrants on board that are delivered to them directly by human beings , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can go back , so that vessels can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least such a coincidence , only 1,3 miles before the Libyan coast was held , according to the acc@@ ord of the Public Prosec@@ ut@@ or , whose content of Italian media has been published . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected , through the authority of the Italian coast guard , the lif@@ ebo@@ ards in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ fs monitors . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , above all had an Italian police officers on board that monitors its activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations , have previously been prepared to keep to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday , that the new rules would be considered need@@ less but acceptable , since they would be no &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their b@@ ail@@ outs . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization doctors without borders ( M@@ SF ) .
&quot; meanwhile , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy during the last weeks , what the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast and the cooperation with the local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further discussions with Libyan citizens in this month , about economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , N@@ iger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that can leave these countries in the hope of Europe . &quot;
pins and tri@@ as
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin reserve post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the north @-@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days long and sights . &quot;
there were three be@@ amed guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; it followed viewpoint , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the Pest side and the pre @-@ finished levels . &quot;
in between there was always a longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ bun@@ als .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the People &apos;s Festival .
&quot; again the look@@ out point at the viewpoint , connected by &quot; flo@@ cks &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate An@@ sti@@ ege . &quot;

console instead of la@@ wns - Bundes@@ liga ge@@ ars for E @-@ Sport
sit the Sport @-@ Stars in future before computer consoles instead of struggling with wind and weather through the stadium ?
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious growth , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages . &quot;
they have also recognized the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this area .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in mid July an e @-@ sport department and took two professionals for the computer playing FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to delight all new young audi@@ ences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the Executive Board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
he is sure that on these train even a number of understanding .
&quot; the upcoming weekend organized the football @-@ World verband FIFA to London the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs are joining together . &quot;
&quot; besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven qualified . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now an agency for virtual football player .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 years old , that young people are still going into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year old . &quot;
&quot; and : the tried , all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer . &quot;
prominent e @-@ spor@@ tsmen under contract could be more likely to be present on these markets than once a year to send the Federal Council to Asia than once a year .
what is it exactly ?
&quot; at the E @-@ Sport , computer games like &quot; &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or even the soccer simulation of FIFA on playing level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in the normal sport also , Li@@ gen established , in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and at the Asian play , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it at all about a right sport .
for many , the idea is certainly ordinary . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bery has long been faced with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ ch@@ schule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport , because it is com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions , which one can also find in classic sports - for example increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it also needed cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response capacity . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ er should not only exercise on the console , but also exercise their bodies and pay attention to the diet . &quot;
&quot; the fine player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; but also problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is getting more and more an issue . &quot;
checks are difficult at online games and in the scene the structures of classical Sports .
positive highlights the scientists the high inclusive effect of the e @-@ sport .
&quot; the players are internationally traveling , this is like a great global family , there are no intercultural shirts . &quot;
a study of business consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ federation Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , in Germany , 50 million euros have been implemented , mainly about advertising , sponsorship and great tournaments . &quot;
sales grew to 130 million in three years .
against the nearly 2,@@ 4 billion euros in the Bundes@@ liga is little .
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant . &quot;
international are many countries already further .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball ho@@ ist Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez at the US Team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher is investing in e@@ Sports competition .
also in Europe a lot .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport had been introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ bery . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ owned liga are committed to Dut@@ t , an e @-@ sport department set up . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison with Germany , V@@ f@@ B @-@ Executive Board explains R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; fall only in no@@ stalgia , and the old times are to be clari@@ fied , is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it is about protecting the tradition of the association , but the company is at the same time to al@@ ign the modern market at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ tised world , &quot; also means Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; then you cannot make it clear that only when football is all the way , as it always was . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the texts , the Con@@ rad Roy pushing for su@@ ic@@ ide , &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend through lyrics and calls to su@@ ic@@ ide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to mal@@ nutrition . &quot;
&quot; Carter was sentenced on June 13 , 2014 by Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ com@@ for@@ ted .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free to appeal .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both them and Mr Roy in a psychological illness . &quot;
&quot; in red p@@ ants and a cre@@ me@@ colored bl@@ ouse dressed , Carter da with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ down eyes , when they were sentenced . &quot;
&quot; their actions made Con@@ rad Roy , said the prosec@@ ut@@ or of the court said . &quot;
she finished his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility taken over , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown a rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters attorney said , it is a &apos; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that she is completely de@@ plor@@ able . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity , or even their cl@@ ergy can have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ ut@@ or read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day , in which I pray not the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters , says it in it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she is persec@@ uted by the realization &quot; &quot; I will never participate in the wedding of her brother or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this single person having been together with whom I was together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep in my life for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit another su@@ ic@@ ide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead in a car in 2014 to be found dead in a car .
&quot; the case attracted national attention to himself , after car@@ ter &apos;s text revealed that she had encouraged him to finish his life . &quot;
&quot; grab the springs of a building , rede@@ em you myself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , she said in several messages that she was sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on vacation . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his su@@ ic@@ ide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is to switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sear@@ ched for his attention by the death of Roy and ord@@ ained that they benefit from any press by the case .
the case has the legal opinion shared .
&quot; the few , the Carter defended , belonged to am@@ anda Kno@@ x , which was sentenced in Italy because of the murder of her British ro@@ ommate in Italy before it was acqu@@ itted for two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and assistance , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua was allowed to rech@@ arge the Audi Cup as captain of the captain , is no coincidence . &quot;
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed Cup winner will be a big season to - Extra motivation as not .
&quot; something was different from his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even if the additional clothing piece was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m , and also not a Manuel Neu@@ er , he made himself a shared relationship with his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach does not have announced , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of Coach could tell me so too .

&quot; sugar@@ s are being distributed at the lov@@ est thing for those who want to take a lot , which one wants to keep in La@@ une . &quot;
&quot; so who was chosen to enter the legacy of Lah@@ m , a small extra motivation can only be used . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player to take on responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday at the 22 @-@ year @-@ olds than Mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
&quot; right behind , this is now its position , the white t@@ de on the arm did her rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ me in this starting point like the one who can take the rod best in the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to channel the dead group tro@@ upe . &quot;
he had the view for the whole while many others were occupied with themselves .
&quot; Vid@@ al thus , to over@@ play its missing fitness ( fol@@ ly hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil come out to the achievements of Asia @-@ travel ( fol@@ d@@ ded also only limited ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le to fall into their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
the un@@ folded very well .
&quot; I ran beside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both ag@@ ated sou@@ ver@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ le tried to successfully build a few times in the game building . &quot;
his colleague Ru@@ dy gave us that the result was not the way we had hop@@ ed .
but he also showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; playing games , Tem@@ po@@ change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as un@@ used this Bavaria world still is for re @-@ accessible , one saw afterwards to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for example was not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me passed after a few scar@@ ring statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard of sweet@@ ness an interesting phrase , &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; at Bavaria , you just need to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , it does not need to bring the new ones no longer . &quot;

&quot; it has often been irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) nor the Ministry of Rhein@@ land @-@ Palatinate . &quot;
&quot; this is seen after more than one year , in which the new economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and bl@@ ending the old minister at the same time .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes the wishes of the economy to blocked the Lem@@ ke Office . &quot;
the largest K@@ ehr@@ e sees Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the complete order of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now on top of the country &apos;s Pri@@ ority list .
&quot; in this year the ministry will meet on a planning process , until 2021 should be the building right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Tri@@ er , which stands in the urgent need of the federal government plan . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to take the route in December 2020 , says Minist@@ erial Spe@@ aker Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us looks like a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive . &quot;
&quot; the industrial and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er seeks , as by Wis@@ sing , at the moment the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate @-@ Label to boost the sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years . &quot;

the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; at the planned street building be quick facts to create , at the same time , there are the land at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Head of the Chamber of Commerce Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , which want to adjust the Wis@@ sing in the state of mobility , so far until 29 places are occupied . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to share external offices .

&quot; Audi should change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ers are confronted with a counter @-@ reaction . &quot;
&quot; one day before the Audi announcement of Audi told BMW , that it would offer you to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Chair@@ woman said , the company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; intelligent options are limited as a constra@@ int &quot; , &quot; and then moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based on diesel vehicles or limit . &quot;
Daim@@ ler was announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the entre@@ es as recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen ox@@ ides , the diesel engines apply as car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ eous and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of automotive manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alization of diesel tools to install , take advantage of what it is difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to p@@ amper the powerful car firms and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called exhaust devices that regulate emissions when a car was tested , but with normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of the ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Germany in the motor development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investig@@ ators in Volkswagen , after the authorities to have installed a system in order to cope with the emissions regulations in Europe and a request that was focused on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be heavy loads : the luxury car manufacturers contributes to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ases and the lau@@ ghing against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most published Car@@ to@@ on carto@@ ons , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ases of his figures are its hall@@ mark . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian works and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he made himself among other things as a sign for bl@@ az@@ ing cards by - which it was frustr@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded at the end of the 60s of the breakthrough : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo took many fans .
again and again the artists of cities are inspired .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo @-@ figures c@@ w@@ ander in drawings with the shooting Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he is sitting on the drawing , according to the drawing , lives almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , Pl@@ ush animals and watches are continuing to find his dro@@ l@@ y figures continued much spread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years he has also been working on a drawing film , and a TV series with its figures . &quot;
&quot; the main person in the film &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; is a gir@@ affe - Mor@@ dil@@ less popular animal in his drawings - that has a thous@@ and@@ able ss@@ ler as an counter@@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures in the 3D movie , the 2019 should come to the chin . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the screen@@ play is not written by him .
&quot; that &apos;s why it is more of the TV series , which is produced , as its original design@@ ations , which is power@@ less . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened by climate change
&quot; he became a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; lav@@ ender is due to due to the d@@ rought rec@@ alled conditions and due to the diseases of transfer insects , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in spring and much more . &quot;
this has an effect on the lifetime of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small dial , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf @-@ fac@@ ades , and with very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil cur@@ ves not only for holi@@ day@@ makers but it is also very sought for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long cl@@ ots with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ ENT@@ W@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or curved . &quot;
&quot; so , we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
&quot; to the solutions that are considered to be considered , a better water @-@ distribution and the slo@@ wing of the dark from the ground , but also the radi@@ ant mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties , which are resistant to dry resistance . &quot;

the ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journalist empha@@ sized the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet in order to examine their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and c@@ eas@@ eless drugs . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is more secure : they should take their children to the office , who were the goal of an attack with gran@@ ulates , or make them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , Neutr@@ al , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ por@@ ter , name for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdom@@ inal . &quot;
&quot; there are drugs regul@@ ators , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists who are suspected , on the secret list of the government or the cart@@ els , which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no relaxing break from the violence , and throughout the land the cor@@ p@@ ses , are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to in December 2012 gave his ministry for attacks and threats under Federal protection , and until now there was at least seven dead in seven states this year . &quot;
&quot; under the latter , their editors and their In@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence will be deep received , although its presence is everywhere present - a large photo by Val@@ dez , which shows its center@@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; building . two Repor@@ ter in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ter discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 has been established a special federal pro@@ secution in order to process the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee to protect journalists have only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of Mor@@ den , which are linked to drug trading and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists will rarely be brought to trial . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ com@@ for@@ ged and although the terrain is now even tra@@ oc@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers of justice , without justice , the meeting has little benefits for discussion , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid , to w@@ asting my time in this workshop , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we distr@@ ust all . &quot;
in the morning of May 15th Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks away before the red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car , and 12 times was shot on him , presum@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; &quot; T@@ wel@@ ded river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the cap drove away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he leaves a woman and two adults .
rum@@ ors tend to be free in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans de@@ ar@@ rest last year and the delivery to the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ ling fields of the country , since ri@@ val@@ isi@@ tive fac@@ tions are struggling to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; there is nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of ver@@ ted , two @-@ stor@@ ey Maus@@ ol@@ een for drug king , which are bigger than many houses for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs @-@ trade routes in the United States .
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the release of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ing boxes in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may be anno@@ yed the sons , suspected number of members bought each copy of the output , as soon as they were delivered on time boxes . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of a different newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country on its own safety . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
&quot; he had long survived his friends and colleagues , that he would always be there . &quot;
&quot; he worked as an experienced re@@ por@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este , as he joined together with five colleagues at the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without to encounter the smo@@ ker problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with the time the newspaper deser@@ ved a reputation because of cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and revenues and advertising . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ters loved it , able to publish hard meetings without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else treat them . &quot;
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history , wherever they led . &quot;
he gave voluntarily to that he had fear .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you must assume the task that falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what did you do with so many still@@ s ... why did you not say what was going out before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missing Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ak bird , who was like a port worker , the friend , the generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher that knew how to survive . &quot;
you trusted on his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go and always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; well , ask them : was his love for routine his ent@@ ail ? &quot;
&quot; his death also has forced them to ask her own assu@@ mptions to question how they can do their work best and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their women , their children , their clean shops , their hard @-@ run@@ ners and cross @-@ debate , to employ drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ c@@ ensor and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
trust in his own inst@@ in@@ aries .
if it smells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is said the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell can be a sense of dre@@ amed ... and then the thing with J@@ avier has happened . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government bodies at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the space where the staff met by Ri@@ odo@@ ce to the safety training , were suddenly no mobil@@ es allowed . days before , Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside the two polic@@ emen examined protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
&quot; they were commissioned by the state government , the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class area of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; half in the Scher@@ z , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked whether this officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , who referred to the Gover@@ nor themselves as not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountainous countryside , where the drug control de facto are under control . &quot;
for the edition of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has dri@@ lled over three main stories .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the brother of the former well known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors who concentrated on the home city of the Govern@@ ors .
&quot; and there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Public Prosec@@ ut@@ or , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who has been kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drug operators and authorities . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ter made out of public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a policy of policy , who heard the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which domin@@ ates nearly all political planes . &quot;
recently several pron@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of highly car@@ ni@@ cal cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ por@@ ter to write about prior inci@@ dents in this eat@@ ery , including one , in which a son of &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man took a military transition . &quot;
&quot; only a few months before , the readers would have seen the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had already knew what is happening , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; because of its slim body . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez has been dedicated to storage space for signs and sti@@ cker to protest against the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something that they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ por@@ ter Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez schn@@ app@@ te himself a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the Office of the Public Prosec@@ ut@@ or .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared after three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials tell , based on DNA tests that it is his . &quot;
throughout the country journalists have become lau@@ ghing as they have written in organized &quot; SOS Press &quot; in walking distance and construction .
&quot; this day is the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; in a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez the authorities to give them sp@@ ying and bring them to , because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since then asked that she is re @-@ divided by the government , because she is worried that their anger has hurt their obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime , to participate in the government officials and a consistent society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters are not only killed by drug addi@@ ties , but also on the command of politicians and security guards , which organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the media @-@ Sax@@ on group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials last year .
&quot; in Mexico minded you give , because they want you dis@@ proportion@@ ate the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found together with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Z@@ etas cart@@ el , &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer scanning and head@@ phone parts next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
&quot; others continue , as it did El Man@@ ana by Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of its director in 2004 . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly directed to the drug cart@@ els with an editorial article on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have escaped from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile and they still watch the streets and are looking for dangers .
&quot; and sometimes they will be h@@ unted by the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was mur@@ dered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico @-@ City three months after the escape from VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay back and continue working , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ made decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , gives to the fact that the drug stores it sc@@ ares him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became re@@ por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; by midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , when once all their teleph@@ ones began to be sum@@ mar@@ ised . &quot;
a number of sh@@ ot@@ ings with Band@@ en@@ riv@@ als and security guards in the vicinity of the bath@@ or@@ tes Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed mess@@ enger .
the war escal@@ ated as it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
&quot; from the boarding ground , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed on the next day .
Sir@@ enen near - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a view of the polic@@ emen , who stopped to see if they were in readiness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid of all , they showed it not . &quot;
&quot; under the vast portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , its Mittel@@ finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , followed the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you also just remember , &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; If the same day , on the J@@ avier was mur@@ dered , the train@@ e@@ n me asked me to send it to the road on the road . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to so@@ ften its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue if also a fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; now , researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable Nas@@ horn of a Canadian mountain labor@@ ers were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that she could even find that his schu@@ pp@@ ly skin from red@@ dish was Braun - and they said , she could have had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; referred to him as &quot; the b@@ ted pan@@ de@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs , who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs which lived in the middle of the circle between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved state has researchers that describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic is the end @-@ on plant @-@ ni@@ vor@@ es the best preserved Fossi@@ l of its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed like the surrounding rocks at the Plat@@ ze , and decided to look more accurately . &quot;
that was discovered by him Fossi@@ l was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy pe@@ um@@ ph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just have a little with the eyes of blin@@ ks , you could almost believe it slept , &quot; said the captain Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to see . &quot;
it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies - the mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs .
&quot; researchers have found that this plant @-@ fres@@ ser , although he is covered with a arm@@ or , and a changing tank is likely to be threatened by meat @-@ filled din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the highly @-@ ar@@ ched din@@ osau@@ rs used to hide a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used to hide a shi@@ el@@ ding technology , which is used as a counter@@ party which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have been allowed to mix themselves better in its surroundings and to so@@ ak its enemies , say experts , which indicates that it has been threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made the head@@ lines in May and is now seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ch@@ elli was named after the museum techniques Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it to Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists who document patterns and shape of sc@@ ales and arm@@ our about his body .
&quot; they discovered the con@@ sh@@ ady , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature dar@@ ker was as its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the con@@ sh@@ ady usual is common , the results are surprisingly , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living in today . &quot;
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs was ho@@ oked by enough pressure through meat @-@ ni@@ vor@@ din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution fav@@ oured the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ aded - think of deer , z@@ eb@@ ras or shor@@ tw@@ ard - are much smaller and vulnerable as pre@@ y , which sign@@ alizes that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong boot@@ y behavior on a massive , strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ y of the circle must have been , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their sc@@ ales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was brown .
&quot; scientists still examine the animal in evidence of his life , including his current Dar@@ min@@ um , to find out what it has eaten as its last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , driven into a river and went out into the sea , where he sank in the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alberta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably much more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ated skin , but also in three dimensions , and the original form of the animal ret@@ ains , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost as exactly as in the early roundabout .
&quot; you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with the eyes , you could almost believe he is on sleep . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time , as huge Ther@@ opo@@ da , the car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ als , which stood on two legs , went through earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ dis@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs was h@@ unted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11,@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings in the journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology appear , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sil@@ enced after the death of the sea and in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the worrying din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ aments , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hips . &quot;
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have wei@@ gh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
it enth@@ s two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long peaks that rag@@ ed by his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ dis@@ ed plant @-@ ni@@ vor@@ es was sh@@ ou@@ ted by the Western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river floods it into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ rs keep his arm@@ our in an exquisite detail .
the hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the door@@ way still hol@@ lo@@ wing along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I do it , the conf@@ using it will be . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied reset of the skin still cover the hol@@ low tank plates , which carry the sk@@ ull of the beast . &quot;
&quot; his right for@@ ef@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are split up . &quot;
I can count the sc@@ ans on his sole count .
in the Stor@@ m : Mass@@ am@@ aram@@ bol@@ ts on A@@ 8 : many Ver@@ Last
fier@@ ce accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 cars are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ muni@@ tion .
&quot; there are numerous clubs , kilomet@@ re long St@@ af@@ ers and G@@ af@@ fer . &quot;
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) have been in@@ ju@@ red on the late Thurs@@ days in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ ts around 20 people .
&quot; according to the first details of the police were opposed to 17.00 . between the Adel@@ z@@ hausen und O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a th@@ under@@ storm just below 30 cars , including even trucks , inter@@ conn@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; above all , the exact number of recent documents do not first contain any information . &quot;
&quot; it is easy to moderate to moderate injury , a police spokes@@ man said . &quot;
a great advent of lif@@ ebo@@ y vehicles was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in Direc@@ torate Munich , some ten kilometers long ago was formed . &quot;
&quot; as a AZ Repor@@ ter , it also came on the counter@@ car to massive disabilities - by numerous g@@ af@@ fer . &quot;
&quot; the fire@@ bri@@ g@@ ades were the hall@@ marks of the vehicle , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. there was a second accident at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
thereby it was a coll@@ ision between an auto@@ cr@@ acy and a car .
a rescue helic@@ opter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everybody has experienced it : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or she is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the creativity and awak@@ ened a uns@@ ett@@ led or rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ed the rides in the middle of the work@@ flow .
timetable control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the German railways currently testing the fre@@ el@@ ly driver control .
&quot; simply confirmed by phone , that you have taken up his place and used the ticket ticket . &quot;
&quot; currently , a test run on two routes . &quot;
&quot; when the offer is , we wide from it . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a train speaker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; calls the train the chassis de@@ valuation without the creativity . &quot;
&quot; to use the use , however , must be met some requirements : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have booked a online ticket - what is already doing most passengers already .
&quot; you also have to have bought it via the App of the Rail , the DB Navigator , which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seat @-@ reserved .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works so : one climb@@ s in the train , calls his tickets under &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the test customers , a button will appear to be an electronic shipment . &quot;
the tractor guides get to their mobile devices a message that chassis X is located on the train and has taken the property seat Y .
comes the Zug@@ companion from the chassis version to place Y he knows that there is a passenger with already ent@@ worth@@ less online ticket .
&quot; so , you can continue to sleep , continue to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; check in &quot; &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railways - which again should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to relax without ticket control through our train @-@ accompanied staff , ch@@ ew@@ ing in the DB Navigator just yourself . &quot;
&quot; this enables the guests to make their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Executive Board of DB correspondence . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often goes railway , white that besides delays and dil@@ uted the rides are one of the greatest hass@@ les . &quot;
&quot; for many times you have , in any case , however , one of the fellow travellers do not need any documents that you need for de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you have to proceed .
&quot; the sequence are endless discussions between tension lad@@ der and rides , which leads to bad mood in the section or large room and delays in controlling your own tickets and take the creativity at the end of time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .

how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to their core .
&quot; only one day after they arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ ate on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment which she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
you stum@@ bled across a post from someone from high school .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it still lies on the road . &quot;
&quot; confused , as no one was posted on her Fe@@ ed the information , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly ret@@ ched on its tim@@ eline .
&quot; the Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officers in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed , live to twe@@ ets . &quot;
he posted an image of Bro@@ wning &apos;s leb@@ rid body that was out@@ stretched on the street and would stay four hours there .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell at itself . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she placed her cell phone to return later in the evening twe@@ et on people on the Can@@ field drive .
&quot; there were photos from the police band and people , the cri@@ ed , and from a man who said to his father , who took a sign with the wording : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
you watched a live Fe@@ ed in which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of prot@@ esters with a bell@@ ish dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , un@@ attended another polic@@ eman his ri@@ f@@ le and crying : &quot; I will all kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , it reminded Fer@@ rell at its statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to ourselves and that we can call it typical .
at this moment I felt sho@@ ok .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a flight back and went home next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father , and decided that the two will drive the next morning to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , &quot; in the cin@@ emas on the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , of love and loss , the strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to challenge answers . &quot;
&quot; as a Fer@@ rel with her daughter who brought a fl@@ oral dress , and a suitable crown carried away , after Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the two one conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember , as I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; remember what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are now going to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , and that was not correct . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
that which is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and moved them to it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience an ec@@ at@@ ant racism , it is no different than the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove her a bad service to keep them far away . &quot;
&quot; the first stop , when they arrived at Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , was found at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that was transformed into a camps as the activists to the possible non @-@ indic@@ t@@ ment of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner , who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared po@@ ckets before and hal@@ ves to pass it to prot@@ esters .
slowly began to accept a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after the 9th of August , she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ urses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in Organ@@ ise .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted only &quot; &quot; documented &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came from Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of White - in a community that benef@@ ited from her pain and their resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who have been born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area , which is known for its activ@@ ism by death tr@@ ap . &quot;
his engagement brought together Fer@@ rell the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after bro@@ wns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , as I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was to focus on a Ferr@@ er experience - to show that it is in motion &quot; not around a Messi@@ ah leader , but about a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the apparent participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ y@@ ells life as they love themselves and their wife mar@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked &quot; , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I understood that at this work , I have to give a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the human being . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells history plays the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of black Teen@@ agers Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as sul@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly struggling with different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must carry the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement is really kept by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it is obvious that &quot; this is not a affir@@ mation type of action , which was chosen as the heart of the film due to their identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coincidence , though she was at the forefront , because with a life at these crosses as a black , vibr@@ ule woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel her energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the news cameras have disappeared in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , but the rac@@ ist connections between the community and the police continue to pers@@ ist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on gran@@ ting for 2 ½ years due to the block of a highway on a demonstration .
&quot; it describes the social policy atmosphere of the area , called her home : &quot; a m@@ ess &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they cl@@ amm@@ ates to a vocals and she feels committed to this memory , since then she went on the road three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size w@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ reader discuss over bit gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves the people although it is not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south @-@ edge of the pedestrian zone has been divi@@ des since the first presentation 2009 the population in advocates and opponents .
cold leaves the issue hardly any .
&quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; say the one to the bit &apos; gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; This would be real &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side , &quot; &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi leg ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the prop@@ on@@ ents are building that a gallery draws more customers to the city , of which also the other business benefit , fear the opponent &apos;s pedestrian ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery will be exactly planned on the plot , on which the farm market stands , in the 13 direc@@ tional market market its products . &quot;
at the beginning of construction work will be finished .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a Mark@@ thal in the new building - and at the Bed@@ a place with opportunity to go out sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying a weekly market for many years now .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the countryside always happy to be very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher we discovered for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether to market direct market in a Mark@@ thalle in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent . &quot;
&quot; however , this might not be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s shopping basket in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ apes or supermarket : I find the super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
but you see how many shop@@ pers will be empty - some have been working here for months and years .
&quot; but since it is not even a short weekly market , it is all the more important that we can at least get the market hall at least . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered are fresh , is largely offered directly from the producers and is ob@@ end@@ lessly inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , store stores in a shopping centre only collect from larger companies , as the dor@@ m are often not portable for a ret@@ ailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special stores there is almost no longer and what is still remaining , will probably still disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a mall with a Mark@@ thalle does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
most of all : where should the farmers market hall during construction time ?
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution , even if the bit @-@ gallery will actually come . &quot;
&quot; or does it create the gh@@ o@@ st bit gallery previously , all the shops from Bit@@ burg to sell ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , does not need any one . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a farm market it is thanks to the w@@ ahn@@ sin@@ ess many - as I find - po@@ int@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore .
&quot; when the farm@@ houses is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a perfect simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ significant - that hang out of the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist in He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tup@@ ppers and hair@@ sections that were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former Secret service Analy@@ tics sent a 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison sentence after they made a secret diplomatic reports on the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2nd , is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ embl@@ ance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has transformed their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and cur@@ riculum , whose condem@@ nation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg has been extrac@@ ted by the algorithms of DNA that was extrac@@ ted by Mann@@ ing , like someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data might look like someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways that may be interpreted and the in@@ tough@@ er determin@@ ism of this inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has spoken openly about the identification as a woman , was sentenced in 2013 because of 20 charges , including six violations against the es@@ pi@@ on@@ ag@@ eg@@ etz , computer was and theft . &quot;
&quot; by the prison , her picture was suppres@@ sed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ting , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is inten@@ tionally sitting on a driver seat and a plat@@ in@@ bl@@ onde Per@@ ücke carries - with which it was associated with . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project &quot; stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist in portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ ens@@ ky arti@@ facts like cigarette mu@@ te and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um , extrac@@ ted the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like . &quot;
that was the time when they received an e @-@ mail from a timeframe .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at this time , and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea , and asked if they wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist , and their det@@ ain@@ ted M@@ use were passed to un@@ equal pen@@ pal , which in the course of two years several letters inter@@ change@@ able . &quot;
she created even one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ erte Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Images , &quot; which a future fores@@ aw in which the president would convert Chel@@ ation judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years would demand in a military coup in K@@ ansas was a welcome kind of happ@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; there is also a little deeper and starting at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tru@@ mp leads a war against inform@@ ants from the government camps and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to remedy the rigi@@ d divisions , which he should actually remedy . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg after the stran@@ ger Tim@@ ing of all these things was asked , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery the written artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with her superior sub@@ ordin@@ ance ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis gender , race , sexuality and culture have been . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , her mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of C@@ s and GS and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , showing the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or cl@@ ot@@ e@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific dic@@ tionary of the artist ) , like amazing similarly , at least in biological regard , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take , is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective them are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in an own room , is one page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ el . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing as she appears with a free phone calls in the hand from the discipline of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; if they speak your speech , then they have won . &quot;
&quot; so , never before the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who greet from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I am still going to go@@ dly , if I talk about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it &apos;s fores@@ try in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed into the center of the space of masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ical simul@@ ator that mer@@ ges themselves like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , which were written with pencil on their genetic h@@ lo@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowds &quot; , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to be like a mass movement , which forming themselves with Chelsea , such as the movement , which was also hidden behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford because of killing
&quot; a country @-@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who were looking for a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries . &quot;

&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ them have been in be@@ zz@@ led now and excluded from the subject of the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case that is investigated by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University operates at this investigation &quot; , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the university and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation , that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK , in contact and ready to help the U.S. income authorities . &quot;
&quot; the statement , added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want it to be . &quot;
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said , he urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has a notion of their location , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building administration of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received a mysterious tip , the said that in apartment 10@@ 08 has happened . &quot;

&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the sacrifice and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will complete the W@@ ada timetable in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
Russian Vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( W@@ ada ) to restore the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada roadmap was updated in this regard , &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada , to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ creation of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain nothing , which could cause Russia cause concern . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the list below , however , represents that Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities approved the reported results obtained by the W@@ ada approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko : &quot; we lead the investigation through , as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has given a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; mut@@ kos words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , then added : &quot; we repeatedly said that the report has been controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report uncondi@@ tionally , &quot; he added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of the dop@@ ing Sk@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada of the implementation of dop@@ amine in Russia .
&quot; however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the main qu@@ arti@@ ers of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada Direc@@ torate Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli that R@@ USA@@ DA moves in the right direction . &quot;

start @-@ ups which will help your company not to become the next u@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the happiness in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the poll@@ s did not work .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; and even if you spoke An@@ onym@@ ity , some workers don &apos;t miss the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce H@@ air Care Society Madison Re@@ ed . &quot;
she has helped people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing of software to address the specific purpose of the measurement of the employees , it allows companies to address surveys , speci@@ fying groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ n allowing C @-@ suite managers to handle and contact the administrative board . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools such as Str@@ ava and Fit@@ Bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive by Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools is used to measure employees . &quot;
salvation said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows most complaints and what managers have low requirements - so that you can bo@@ ots why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to stay in order to remain at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who described in Sk@@ and@@ als , who described an environment of Bel@@ ables in which those who have spoken have been pun@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups , such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business meeting . &quot;
&quot; the Global Governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behaviour and recognize an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ everything in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent companies leaves customised &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , to collect confidential answers in real time and see the heat @-@ cards of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS @-@ hot@@ line with which employees can report a real behavior .
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Super@@ visory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has gathered the Reg@@ ulators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that his staff is badly covered or beh@@ aving un@@ ethical , it can experience more precious consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , worker flu@@ idity and cl@@ ams , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Con@@ ver@@ cent has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she wants to submit a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said , there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company Con@@ ver@@ cent uses problems that have been hidden in offices in cities or states , which have been hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or inno@@ cent internship can be identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano that leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders in front of employment and disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; company started to take ethics , values and staff commitment in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen coll@@ ap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it lasted until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and strain the company with recur@@ ring fees for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ app@@ hire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which has been raised the entire capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ itz@@ ern acquired $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the inter@@ connected nature of enterprises , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more than before .
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only in@@ serts .
staff want the feeling that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to feel in a company that their voices are , and that the work they do , then feel more committed to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors achieve return when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are working and engaged .
&quot; when the analytics tools promise to increase commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on the employee &apos;s commitment to the experts of workplace culture is important .
&quot; however , the data are useless if the administrator of a company cannot take action . &quot;
&quot; in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that changes on the way is . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appointments can breed and medit@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 conversation , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who have seen to very much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow , employees are asking themselves , &quot; did you really hear me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
and whom you do not care about why should I ?
&quot; Madison Re@@ ed , who has now led monthly co @-@ surveys now , was able to rede@@ em measures on the same day if a problem above G@@ lin@@ t will be reported so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated staff , she was able to re@@ organise multiple teams within the company and add a communication training within the company to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights about the employees and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A remo@@ ves the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood @-@ ins
&quot; it goes to 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new exercise areas of the team on campus . &quot;
some have moved their tri@@ kot@@ ers and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of training camp .
for a good part of the team they represent minutes a lunch break .
&quot; players who are written towards the summer courses , will return after the three @-@ hour exercise on their final check , before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 a.m. to the Aqu@@ man Football Centre will return . &quot;
&quot; this is for the boys the next three days a real tre@@ k mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday was closed . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to make the load the player easier , and it has been extended their days - at least until the finale on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training of U@@ C@@ LA should start 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the player already fully packed sched@@ ules . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood moved into the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six players in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
they are to ab@@ ide in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of the formal playing preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he support the rules of N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add another point in the number of players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it down , they plac@@ ken up , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it really is magnificent . &quot;
&quot; U@@ C@@ LA will end their practices as soon as the camp is finished , as given the clear visibility of its fields from an adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ beat , which is already covered with foot@@ balls , which is already a slight task behind a door@@ step . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a spatial that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people will rent a room and then adjust there to draw an exercise . &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ob@@ and of a exercise it is a pretty good deal .
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I do not make too big concerns .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with haw@@ k messages to third parties and show their results under the original contribution , then the world &apos;s largest online @-@ social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine methods to identify possible mis@@ ses and to send them to fact over@@ insp@@ ections , which may possibly display results of the fact check out of the original product . &quot;
Facebook has been cri@@ tici@@ zed as one of the main points for so called F@@ ake @-@ News for so many believe they have also influenced the US presidential elections 2016 .
&quot; the problem also has become a major political issue in Europe , whereby French voters were going to be pun@@ ished in advance of the presidential elections in May , and Germany shall not be pun@@ ished by the social media networks , if it does not succeed , h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings like before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook in a separate Declaration in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will be launched a test of the new facts check . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the realization , which stories of fact over@@ checked the third parties want to be challenged , people want to meet more context to make well @-@ founded decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product man@@ ag@@ ner for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to his news Fe@@ ed to reduce false news . &quot;
creating a com@@ ic box : a lock in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he was a sip .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of its cozy seat at the Ma@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now on inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful , to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; embr@@ aces the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only have re@@ acted on the thum@@ b on the side of a letter , which was written by a double bed in the 1700 &apos;s years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b @-@ pressure !
&quot; and letters are always cra@@ wl up to smoke , because at that time a fire can become a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he himself also were there . &quot;
&quot; I love Archive ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so with old papers is be@@ aten that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have been honest my welcome &quot; &quot; ) it seems all too nice to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; Castle , to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ ast@@ o@@ ons of the walls , and the bottles , had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he hi@@ ked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with Land@@ sc@@ iss@@ ors , gardening , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was first received in 2006 as the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes a decade later arrived , the staff began to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , put it on the loft . &quot;
&quot; sli@@ des@@ hows , letters from the time of Engl@@ ischer Emp@@ ires , cards , which poss@@ essed : &quot; one could mean that country @-@ fli@@ cts might be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ke to have fought the two families . &quot;
guys let everything go his gang !
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to view on bre@@ ader base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a revol@@ t , who entered 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &quot; Hing@@ es Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the farm began in this area and I thought , an u@@ prising was a good beginning . &quot;
maybe the two are linked ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est , &quot; which tells the story of the Jes@@ u@@ ite , which was hidden from the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel is represented from the 18th century by filled his own bur@@ ial ( a discovery that was made only years later , when his sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be fool@@ ish to be again debt and spend money for things that they could not afford .
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men proceeds their debt crises , by putting rich old women - I imagine them as a he@@ ap good @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise Er@@ bin@@ nen . &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle Rhodes in search of other unique writing experiences
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ lu@@ än@@ mä@@ ki behind her , the terrain of a gentl@@ eness from the early 20th century , which has been returned from nature again . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : more than 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the envel@@ oping the 301 year old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf has started the town of Bad Honnef on Friday its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to hold Nelson Art@@ z the logo and the slogan . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , it should be the highlight of the campaign on the island of Graf@@ en@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? , ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters to the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write it to her yesterday fre@@ ed website . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to clearly make that man@@ ches is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizen to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; in action you go to more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , says it further . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single @-@ speaking promise , one which the city gives an un@@ mistak@@ able all @-@ time model . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a medium five @-@ dig@@ it amount will be the town of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military re@@ forming in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
every year in early August advis@@ es in Ankara of the Ober@@ ste Military Council ( Y@@ as ) about Pen@@ sion@@ ers and subsidies in the officers &quot; officers .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
&quot; but nothing is routine of the Turkish defense forces , a year after the coup . &quot;
&quot; the meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the headquarters of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; advis@@ ing the discussions under the presidency of the government now also the five four recipes , as well as the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Ex@@ ternal . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the civilians were in the Y@@ as in the number . &quot;
the government moves the bre@@ wing in the military .
&quot; Secretary of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ure of the he@@ aters , the air forces and the nav@@ y were put down . &quot;
since the failed Cou@@ p has consolidated Erdo@@ gan 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als .
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to the alleged connections to the movement of the exile Pre@@ dig@@ al Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees Erdo@@ gan as a wire guar@@ dians of the coup . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people , who have been involved directly on the coup will have been involved in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had been referred to as &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; as he give him the opportunity to clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan is the army really under control ?
&quot; in late February the newspaper &quot; &quot; Hürriyet &quot; &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ discomfort in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; in general , there will be concerns about the increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which manifes@@ ts itself among other things in the abolition of the head@@ box ban for Sol@@ dat@@ inside , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the large @-@ pur@@ se in the army and the security guards goes on .
&quot; mid July Erdo@@ gan sent Erdo@@ gan by decre@@ e another 73@@ 95 state service , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 54@@ 6 soldiers . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Erdo@@ gan appeared in the military . &quot;
the gener@@ als g@@ ages earlier than the actual men of the country .
three times put@@ ted them under calling on their role as guar@@ dian of the world@@ ly state .
&quot; after his election in 2002 Erdo@@ gan &apos;s power shows the power of the military &apos;s step by step , not least under appeal to the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is targeted by the Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; V@@ oc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; V@@ oc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; announced that after the coup are taken out of fear of persecution in foreign countries , the Turkish army will be full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
&quot; meets this , such development could not be the Nato . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is no doubt in the alliance for the inf@@ ants of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; it will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; it looks ahead of lowering the legal immig@@ rant to 50,000 per year to reduce stric@@ ter rules for obtaining visa for a temporary employment and limitations for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by which the US will change the way the citizens from other countries Green Cards will be issued . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains @-@ migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidates who speak English , which have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that our economy are coming to good , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , c@@ ited by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to play route for racing
&quot; over the past few months over the future of the race &quot; &quot; sh@@ utt@@ les &quot; &quot; - now it is to go fast . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , on the mar@@ ched route , on which the tourist track drives , built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race through sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the Department of the Ministry of Department , we should start working on the track in this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g to order and gentle , the country presents itself especially for the tourism important connection , &quot; explained road secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of maintenance of the circuit is about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country exce@@ eds 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle should also be ordered in the future of the country , I am currently finally coordinated , stated S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as a employer may agree on the technical details already .
&quot; there@@ with the roadmap , the vehicles used and the quality standards were negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway society will be closed for a period of eleven years .
so that the race @-@ up shuttle will be ordered by the race on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle is an especially popular railway connection between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
during the last months in the course of a pilot business was tested whether the circuit is used by sufficient many people to order them in the future .
the route is also very strong in parts .
the rise of sex robot is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it is not yet crazy , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex @-@ robots are currently a great thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ti@@ ered professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ acles . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies supply a lot of it and we will see them much more frequent , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key when the release of his new report . &quot;
&quot; modern sex@@ pupp@@ ets have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robot@@ ic partners with a si@@ licate fores@@ kin , which feels warm feeling - with consciously human reactions , which can be achieved by the artificial intelligence . &quot;
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to its beliefs , &quot; and select everything from the eye @-@ colour of the robot to the type or colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is still disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; who would like to be a Step@@ ford woman . &quot;
modern Sex@@ doll@@ s have developed to robot@@ ic with a si@@ licate skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x @-@ robots allows for example to adapt its users , their robots to the characteristics which they are appealing to such as rel@@ tern@@ ess . &quot;
and then there is still the True Comp@@ ani@@ on developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robots with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conv@@ eys the impression of students and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ med the site of True Comp@@ ani@@ on . &quot;
&quot; she likes what you like , and she does not like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed at conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; in the mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lower female characteristics , the players on rape , if one gets a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , be@@ un@@ quiet one most . &quot;
on his website True Comp@@ ani@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women have a vibr@@ ator , why can males do not have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or just a different sex vehicle . &quot;
their formation and growing sophistic@@ ation to something dark and deeper understanding in our culture to retreat from the Ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as op@@ tionally en@@ core .
&quot; most men will of course hold no sex robot , and while the FR@@ R have shown their rising popularity , they remain a provisional at the edge of the consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what crosses by the edge @-@ zones , can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or bother@@ ed , until they have the free market to do this . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a certain crossing that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time where the rights of women are threatened around the world in which the White House has a president who bo@@ iled to have been sexually attacked . &quot;
the deter@@ rent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the Mag@@ d &apos;@@ ) are not the graphical images that s@@ inu@@ ous body and the stolen eyes but how realistic this vision works .
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robot is to make physical simil@@ arity on actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
&quot; their buil@@ ders want they feel human , that they are im@@ itate the motion of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots represent no real women . &quot;
you can not separate yourself from her companion or simply walk away .
&quot; they have no mediation or a background history , nothing , which could distur@@ b to independence or anything that could inter@@ fere with the fantasy of total sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ation . &quot;
expressed differently : they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mp@@ s Big Performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the enth@@ ron@@ eous of the healthy human mind
&quot; it became a bin@@ der of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the U.S. constitu@@ encies , even in small @-@ format families . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest , there was in the USA newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp @-@ chosen relatives . &quot;
we rigor@@ ous ourselves all alleg@@ edly in order to burst our filter types .
less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s to bring together to families .
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ ins , a left @-@ looking poet that lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republi@@ cans in our family , who visited me this week in New York . &quot;
they reminded me that the unity can have a powerful enemy with a common enemy .
&quot; Tru@@ mp in the White House is everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ dre@@ d , with which it fought for decades of politics , suddenly and very strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table , this certainly is a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this also causes significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ acious possibility that we will no longer encounter any longer any day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even start@@ led long @-@ time scenario , in the Tru@@ mp Republi@@ cans of the right wing , &quot; norm@@ alised , which suddenly appear to its standards in comparison to its standards . &quot;
I find myself today from an active no@@ stalgia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of the mad@@ ness - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ah that saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp in fact considered a very mild crimes .
&quot; when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only be mentally healthy to qualify as un@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of New York City department , and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if there is no caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fiber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all cl@@ owns are kn@@ ur@@ ly and the animals rot@@ ate to look at full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely fin@@ ster and clim@@ bed music this is in a notable way . &quot;
&quot; so many cl@@ ues of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream . &quot;
&quot; five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss cottage - the topics @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage counts not - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience , since there are two two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could evaluate the carousel , I could have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before going through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to pick up with a 15 % ti@@ pping money - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slo@@ wing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also practi@@ sing pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the Kauf@@ haus was ap@@ prehen@@ sive , while I have tired the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars . &quot;

&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us asser@@ ted that he held his girlfriend for a great in@@ tru@@ der , who hid himself in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year @-@ year imprisonment by Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say she is too si@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Authority said that they will raise the objection on the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;

as Bauer Arnold a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the neighborhoods of F@@ alls and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen to the holidays and the leading schools were released . &quot;
&quot; three of the ab@@ rup@@ t@@ ations go into the school in the future , four to the real@@ school . &quot;
school leader Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te greeted parents and representatives of the public in the Bi@@ es@@ ental house in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
&quot; as a symbol of the school attendance , the 29 students of the four classes elected by Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Meder a young eagle who grows in Chi@@ n@@ erhof , but then it is released into the freedom . &quot;
&quot; for this , the m@@ und@@ e Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in Chi@@ n@@ erhof . &quot;
Bauer Arnold took a stran@@ ger egg and let it out of his chicken breasts .
instead of a chicken lap a small eagle came out .
&quot; however , the hope to make from him a chicken , sm@@ ashed , the eagle fell on a high mountain its wings and ent@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the hen danced with the young go@@ ck@@ le , the cylinder set to the bet . &quot;
the Eagle stand for the integration , said Schul@@ te Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young is indeed different from the other young animals ( chic@@ ks ) , but they belong to this . &quot;
he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
they wish every quarter cl@@ ue that he has accepted himself in his new school .
&quot; it followed thanks to the colleagues , the former school leader Michael Müller , who goes again and again in teaching lo@@ gs , and the parents representatives . &quot;
&quot; the chic@@ ane is now over , the class teacher Sophia Schu@@ macher . &quot;
she cle@@ ave her pupils after two years of teaching only very ung@@ od@@ ly because it had been a really great time .
&quot; finally , they can rely on the neighborhoods . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students had a song of summer@@ time and holiday season . &quot;
and with the children great joy broke out .
for the new school year already eight first @-@ cl@@ ams are already registered .

software update for diesel cars : what those who have to know now
how exactly is the software update take place ?
need diesel driver to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW group software updates offered for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are intended to improve the gas behavior of cars of the emissions of emissions Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of ACE Auto Club Europe gives inti@@ estimates :
is the new action oblig@@ ing ?
&quot; no , the tr@@ aded software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the oblig@@ ing updates previously only apply to the vehicles , the che@@ er software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fit has arranged the power station ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers receive updates about updates ?
&quot; the makers announced in the next few months , but there is not an exact date . &quot;
Daim@@ ler has informed every person concerned .
&quot; if any in@@ spec@@ tors be due , it will be done in their framework . &quot;
how long will the circum@@ stance be drawn up in total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the works from the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen voluntarily , the car manufacturers act on the subject of environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?

ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glorious events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving under President Tru@@ mp promises to be political .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets first Rap@@ per one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; announced as the cultural institution on Thursday , this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ograp@@ her Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman LE@@ AR ( 95 ) to the schol@@ ar . &quot;
the awards will be transferred at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the awar@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; the LE@@ AR announced with a progressive TV series , announced that it has already announced that participating in the g@@ ala . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New York Times &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even the means to withdraw from - and that will be deb@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the interview with Tru@@ mp to make their view clear . &quot;
&quot; according to the former president John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; among the previous winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , continues in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; however , the place is already written - suitable applicants are r@@ ally . &quot;
for 31 years is W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun as he conv@@ eys in the press .
&quot; he reports from varied , but also challenging tasks that are waiting for its successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it wonder@@ ed that so far no application has received the requirements specification . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or buil@@ ders at the next time .
&quot; thus , - in regard to the regular cancellation of cancellation - even enough time for a development . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach has been operating for the Board of Directors as the Sub@@ e Bau@@ rights authority , the applic@@ ant must be appropriate for the applic@@ ant . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they cannot fill out this out , the citizens would have to travel through to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity of the city and itself is important to him , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good work@@ li@@ ma , as well as a good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in over 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated at the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city experience , it is secure about the building office and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ stage parking . &quot;
&quot; the young bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will strike around 1.5 million euros with about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; if we do it right &quot; , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all wait great tasks on my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
gest@@ ational be present for a city @-@ master large room .
&quot; with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own construction and gar@@ dener , it can be quite flexible . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , so W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town is as ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what rein@@ forces , when new buildings are approved , empha@@ sizes the schei@@ der Stadt@@ bau@@ meister . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is carrying high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a client , &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing now , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for 15 years now . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains a long , wish W@@ acker : &quot; we seek someone who really want to be identified with the place and want to stay . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good company , but also for the further creation of the city . &quot;
&quot; who wants to inher@@ it the Roland W@@ acker to obtain information about the city of Has@@ lach , a completed studies as a diploma engineer or Bachelor with specialty architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt stand high - and low @-@ building , construction planning , atro@@ city affairs , administration of urban assets , urban operating house with Bau@@ hof and Stadt@@ bau@@ ärt@@ ner@@ ei as well as sub @-@ laws , including monument protection . &quot;
bike on lines cast : southern track locked
according to police previously un@@ familiar perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway line in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so strongly damaged that the her@@ ann@@ ah@@ ent goods had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male tat@@ tern and are looking for the night hours to them .
close to the scene there were witnesses a ros@@ ary escal@@ ator and a bike riders were observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ab@@ st@@ reich , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ Christoph Pos@@ ch to APA . &quot;
or the perpet@@ rators brought themselves in great danger and also endangered the tension .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the system as well as the delay , and the cost of rail traffic could also come to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; overall , to go from a &quot; significant &quot; sum , said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , railway traffic on the south trail could be guided without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten groups of persons were held on Friday morning , two of them slept in the remote traffic . &quot;
&quot; Gü@@ ter@@ ys did not fell out , but they had delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged approximately 200 meters of over@@ hau@@ l .
insul@@ ators and cor@@ sten were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( inflammation ) to lin@@ ders &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom of 30@@ 0.000 , causes stomach struggles , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; during those affected people normally get meat and dairy products to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , researchers found at the Washing@@ toner University that contributes to the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins that promote an toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the researcher researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol to make sure that harmful micro@@ bes , which are hidden in the body , not in the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to trigger inflamm@@ ations , are balanced by cells , which promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far toward inflammation , it may result a inflammatory disease . &quot;
experim@@ entation has been determined that a sort of tolerance condu@@ ci@@ ple immune cell on mice occurs which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their entries .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the components of proteins in order to dis@@ solve the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he proposed that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was toler@@ ant diet @-@ toler@@ ant , less inflammatory intestinal flows , if the same system also wir@@ es with people . &quot;
&quot; the Post@@ do@@ kt@@ or@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an examined a kind of immune cell that helped the tolerance as they found that a group of study tastes such cells had , but another group of the same trunk , which had not been separated . &quot;
they suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the stomach @-@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the sc@@ iss@@ ors of the mice were found DNA sequ@@ encing , and they were found six bacterial species that were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them with the mice . &quot;
mice were raised in a ster@@ il@@ ous environment so that they did not develop an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; to understand how the bacteria focused on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ther grow in a liquid , and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells develop into the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; as the active component of the fluid was puri@@ fied , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ acid @-@ acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers have double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the for@@ age of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ s were hal@@ ved , the number of cells declined by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us protect us L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tractors . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether to develop tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by L. reu@@ ter@@ i the cells in people as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory performers . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ s can lead to a expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i .
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic is a &quot; genius &quot; committed
&quot; at Manchester United has signed an &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believe Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Mit@@ tw@@ ard evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million Po@@ unds of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the UEF@@ A @-@ Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressive in the half @-@ season , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira , and more popular . &quot;
&quot; however , MAT@@ IC had been excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which gave M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic start@@ led also Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va @-@ Stadi@@ on , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent contained in this week , that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three more new li@@ abilities , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job , three of his four priority new li@@ abilities . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , for this I thank the club , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great difficulty . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US Air@@ plane Boeing has the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky painted .
&quot; the pil@@ ots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers about the USA , these are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the wheel@@ base was the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers .
the whole thing was a thum@@ bs for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertising earlier .
&quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; and the Boeing @-@ Logo was painted in the sky . &quot;
&quot; new free@@ zer for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
&quot; like the wind blo@@ ws : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel , he was an SPD leader , S &amp; D prime minister in front of elections always with a certain concern after Berlin . &quot;
&quot; not a disturbing fire from the party central , just not a counter@@ wind from the covenant - so lou@@ der the most important wish of the electoral campaign . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has changed dramatically . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees of the Willy Brandt @-@ house observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described with counter@@ wind even in the approach . &quot;
there were underground .
and in one of the others .
the federal CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be sure , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber from the editorial network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
the surprising frac@@ turing of a Gre@@ ens parliament@@ arians led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
&quot; five months before the country election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its own @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens leader Michael Kell@@ ner has promp@@ ted the ab@@ yss of the Gre@@ et Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ west to return their mandate to her mandate .
the crossing to the CD@@ U means a clear dec@@ eption of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ west must immediately return their mandate , &quot; said the German leader and election campaign in the Gre@@ ys network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; it must not be true all that , as a SPD constitu@@ ent fighters , as a Friday morning , the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reached the Party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green Members El@@ ke T@@ ick to the CD@@ U without their own govern@@ ement . &quot;
it is the provisional cul@@ mination of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD of the SPD .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery began with the unexpected significant defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the comrades of the time . &quot;
after the country @-@ day elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia will be everything different .
this then became a lot worse - and it was much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the bar@@ be@@ es , the Du@@ essel@@ dorf Haute the party smoothly . &quot;
the comrades in the weeks then again turns back to the comrades in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; then , when they had just met new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next stop came .
&quot; Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last powerful SPD land@@ press , lost in that weekend his Nim@@ bus , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he did pretty much wrong in the crisis of crisis communication , what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z fights his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ car@@ bure@@ tor and its role in the Super@@ visory Board , the Dutch Prime Minister has already been in criticism since longer . &quot;
Mi@@ ese De@@ frag@@ ments came .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps this is why Wei@@ l has always tried more and stronger in recent weeks , in the covenant of acc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; the endeav@@ ours of the former mayor of Hannover , his power in Berlin , also remained hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him grant him since they formed a stabili@@ zation of the party in Wei@@ l .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could occur . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l meets the partial internal compul@@ sion is the down@@ si@@ can Gre@@ ens basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz does not have at all .
&quot; however , the comrades try to keep their own ranks . &quot;
&quot; their wrath is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the ab@@ it@@ ant female parliament@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , such as Mrs. T@@ west places their own car@@ r@@ ots over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , chief of the party left in the SPD Bundestag , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ west has not been chosen because of her person as a direct candidate , but by the country list of the lower Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the decline of defe@@ ats continued . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Bundestag , acc@@ ents a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate before four years ago was clear : the people made Stephan Wei@@ l to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann who leads the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische SPD as a peak @-@ did@@ at in the Bundestag , the R@@ N@@ D . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career re@@ acts of a future CD@@ U MEPs the W@@ ah@@ ler result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called to clarify the backgrounds .
I want to know if there have been more or more commitments to the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
conveying distance of the Centre III
&quot; who wants to re@@ construct the house in the years , can get assistance from the country soon . &quot;
&quot; informed Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler , and three representatives of St@@ eg Municip@@ al development on Wednesday in sensitive . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a look back to the events so far . &quot;
since 1991 it was in delicate renovation areas .
&quot; back then , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken two thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for grin@@ der , the past s@@ well@@ ings are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is important to promote the interior development , and not only close new construction areas . &quot;
on 4 April we received the information from the Prime Minister Karlsruhe on April 4 that there will be a refurb@@ ishment III area .
&quot; the funding tot@@ alling 833 Euro , of which , 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the church received . &quot;
how does a san@@ itation emerge ?
&quot; you will continue to examine as Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; real old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area is at all interest . &quot;
&quot; if appropriate , the territory may also move again . &quot;
&quot; the pier agreements at the Mit@@ tw@@ ard evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal government programme &quot; &quot; Social Stadt , &quot; in which framework the ra@@ ys would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the programme are the aud@@ iting of interior , the improvement of the living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would object to object , which means per property , carried out . &quot;
the refurb@@ ishment area would then be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the transfer period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2017 .
&quot; even until September this year , however , would only once again take the inventory , within the framework of those who will receive a questionnaire regarding the refurb@@ ishment area . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the stat@@ ute will be carried out as possible , so that next year with the re@@ organisation can be started . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann said that every Comm@@ une carried out the said in advance investigation .
&quot; it is about to evaluate the city &apos;s urban abuse and decide , when re@@ constructed and to what extent . &quot;
there will be also a san@@ itation for the particular plot in the ground@@ book .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again according to delicate and get a picture of the situation , she said . &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and property of building &quot; in which it is among other things about the build@@ able condition and the refurb@@ ishment views .
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; can be made on size , distribution and residents of a residential area . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; bows &quot; &quot; is only possible to fill in the building of business areas . &quot;
&quot; however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new measures will not be condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler stressed that the distribution of funding for the &quot; &quot; windsurfing principle &quot; &quot; - who first comes , ex@@ hor@@ ted first . &quot;
no funding can be reserved for later . &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; village II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refurb@@ ishment &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot;
brilliant invent@@ or has itself a micro@@ chip to come with a handful of movement in house and car
&quot; a brilliant invent@@ or is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he can open his door@@ step , to enter his office and even start with a handful of movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and for@@ ef@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory meeting of the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , together to ensure that the impl@@ ant procedure is carried out after medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles in houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both home and BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House costs the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a nav@@ y helic@@ opter to fly to the South La@@ wn for an event that stresses American production last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers to the data of the military which were left to the T@@ IME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , the heart of the event was on July 17th in the White House with American construction programmes . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helic@@ opter was issued in addition to a yacht of Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ ft from the Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the White House of the White House demanded the presence of the helic@@ opter in a frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helic@@ opter on the South La@@ wn landed in accordance with the records of the Marine Hel@@ ic@@ opter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helic@@ opter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted that you are aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; wrote the com@@ mander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the Deputy Chairman of the aviation industry . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helic@@ opter was met at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that , if the flight should be del@@ ayed from the White House , due to the restriction of the service hours a second team for the return flight would require . &quot;
the original flight production was found during the event at the helic@@ opter while the security sper@@ son of unity during the period was on the ground by plane .
&quot; from the records provided by the T@@ IME , it was not clear whether ultimately a second plane was required . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ atch Act provides state @-@ made , state property for political purposes . &quot;
dat@@ as@@ ets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event would hurt the determination .
&quot; a question that we set was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts , and we were informed about it that this was not the case , wrote the com@@ mander . &quot;
&quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; rep@@ lied the dep@@ uty com@@ mander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as official event and were not covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but even official events have political upper tones .
&quot; on the event , the President gave a boost to reform of the healthcare reform , which was underway in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts for the restr@@ aint of government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the airplane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
Presidents are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
&quot; however , their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp was conducted an investigation in February , as the presidential plane in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ services , and its Twitter account is full of announ@@ cements on the use of the presidential plane through its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products made from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the dep@@ uty secretary of the White House , Lin@@ d@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn , to reset the U.S. president in the White House with precise cen@@ timeters . &quot;
&quot; as a Tru@@ mp at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 was introduced in the White House 58 exercise . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event at the training needs of the plane crash for the month , said a official . &quot;
helic@@ opter units flew in addition to 11 hours a day for &quot; non @-@ presidential system . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; an speaker from Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company had not been involved with the helic@@ opter at the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 is not responsible for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ministry of Ministry of Defence for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D refund fee for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however , 24.@@ 380 USD per airplane . &quot;
records of the unity draw the flight time of the airplane than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of operating the helic@@ opter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for refund rates , is most mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the refund fee for DO@@ D does not include personnel expenses , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time the former pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helic@@ opter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to showcase these week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent . &quot;
&quot; and I think , like most Americans we are all proud of the helic@@ opter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot;
it is of course appropriate to up@@ lift this .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ ed with the helic@@ opter , when he prayed his tour about the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and spoke with the media through his own fleet of corporate products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss ahead of tricky task
leader of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga occurs in the tab@@ ular Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
the TC blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will leave tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel during the tab@@ ular Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
&quot; despite after five games still mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er &apos;s balance , the leader of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga has received the sense of reality . &quot;
teamwork Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has no respect for opponents .
&quot; this is a compact team , which is always playing in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; just on the rear positions , I find the team very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV ensure the imports from the Far North .
&quot; their plans and Finn@@ s can even refer to ins@@ ets in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strongly in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with views of Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Sweden ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas B@@ jer@@ re@@ hus ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; it is as always hard for us .
you also need a good serving happiness . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give the max@@ im Jan@@ vier .
&quot; this is the currently still in the Chall@@ enger tournament at the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fr@@ ench@@ man , who comes from the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec playing Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , at its first deployment in this season . &quot;
the so far defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the white rus@@ sen An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he should be in Kiel , but also like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ owe p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster could also move Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z once again .
&quot; it &apos;s enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hung@@ arians who was in January 2016 still the number one of the junk@@ er@@ ors world list , not that someone out of the trainer about Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the K@@ ader . &quot;

&quot; in his tro@@ ast , the law adopted , the Congress have pack@@ aged a few &quot; constitutional rules &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels dre@@ amed against the U.S. advancement . &quot;

&quot; according to worrying , investors of the domestic O@@ MV , who are co @-@ financed with other European companies in the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea North Stream 2 . &quot;
the dru@@ g@@ cul@@ ation is extensive .
&quot; nevertheless , it may be too early for an assessment of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil concept . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to aw@@ aken the sanctions even by executive order to life . &quot;

roll back@@ wards : the city represents 46 kitchenette .
the city runs the K@@ ita mid@@ day once again .
firm contact persons for the children and one assignment to the team .
in the urban children &apos;s office the clock gets returned .
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in urban children &apos;s accommodation facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ reg@@ . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy leader in the specialist of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; &quot; we are all very happy . &quot;
cooked will continue to be out except house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked fresh .
&quot; the city operates in the creation area of 46 children &apos;s courses , in 44 get children to lunch time a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; in the last kite year , 28@@ 00 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; now you eat not only children who are taken care of 45 hours , in the c@@ ita at noon , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour care if children until 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 Parti@@ cip@@ ants have from 1 September kitchen service : they warm the angel@@ ic foods , complement them around salad , Roh@@ k@@ ost and fruit , por@@ ate the meal individually , give the food out , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as se@@ perate facilities - decides on the chest .
&quot; the kitchen assistant now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical , ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
this is why it is : healthy food and cook@@ ers .
the children should help prepare the food .
the direct connection between the chef &apos;s team is there useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not ever changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita rooms - so far the task of the kitchen of the kitchen - is in future accomplished by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has next to the quality improvement of the kitchen service also the charm that it turned out in the cost comparison between self @-@ reg@@ ie and foreign language for the city as the most economical , it means from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 divi@@ ders are re @-@ employed . &quot;
&quot; but these hours drop around 750 people in the guar@@ dian area not so strong into the weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a trade union would like to present themselves with managers of the mus@@ ku@@ ite @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow .
&quot; G@@ MB Scotland said , the company wrote about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location . &quot;
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which is adjacent to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cu@@ its . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said , he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
he added that employees and trade union representatives would like to know if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the branch of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express &quot; concerns , that the financing for the modernisation of production lines is not being driven . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can gain no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workforce focus greatly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and in front of the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising life @-@ cost of life and of the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a flow of production in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a speaker from Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the Fili@@ ppo at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we value the continuous commitment of employees and union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , our business is constantly checked and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility , and all of them . should our business operations change at the site , the employees and its trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona war@@ ned three years ago from N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the Page of La Liga is your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti ber@@ eu@@ en
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not shown in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after spending an offer of £ 189 million in order to all@@ ay its free@@ wheel cl@@ ause , but have they war@@ ned to Barcelona three years prior to the world level ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has been raised the transfer window in the summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klu@@ b is ready to break the world ch@@ ord by more than the double of the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United returned . &quot;
&quot; after the end , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the most affordable pro @-@ ath@@ l@@ ete of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way , as N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way out to the outside , although a source is always given to the Catal@@ ans , that the club always has always been best to worry about him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world for@@ ew@@ ar@@ ned three years ago from the PS@@ G President ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association who wanted to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players in their sign , so this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish association at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow it to the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by lost one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report &quot; Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the ab@@ uses of Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the ab@@ sc@@ andal with the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions with the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained by former Reg@@ ensburger Bishop and today Car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ year &apos;s brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger their deep regret would express their deep om@@ is@@ sions or their then false assessment of processes . &quot;
the Vatican Council &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; on the other hand cri@@ tici@@ zed that in the reporting of violence at the cathedral sp@@ atzen with &quot; two thirds . &quot;
&quot; regarding the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , none that it would have to be pun@@ ched and sh@@ ame@@ ful deeds &quot; handle , that would have to be pun@@ ished , but the &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; was the &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; historians , and a member of the National Italian bio@@ ethics committees . &quot;
&quot; the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all exercise , is already part of all @-@ day experience and preparing public opinion that is normal for normal &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ af@@ fia . &quot;
also prin@@ cess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; we would be happy to go to the church and that &apos;s a packed Fres@@ sen .
&quot; moreover , they pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; saw a quite normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; to be with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
in connection with the reports about the ab@@ used cases often the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is often found .
&quot; totally wrong , says author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann , who written with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( in 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; it adds value the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which is presented by B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the clarification of the lawyer of Ulrich Weber ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 547 Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and early 1990s . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it means to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , which was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; &quot; in conclusion , so that from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially with high Emoti@@ on@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also fall fier@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other alleg@@ ations , many victims caused the general humanity of R. Bur@@ ns , and therefore , in many cases , despite force , even positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; in an interview , Hes@@ emann , why the final report on the ab@@ sent@@ encing sc@@ andal made at the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; prevention of non @-@ violence in protective elements at Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for a great deal of students , his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to the other , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perf@@ ection@@ ist who has been hand@@ ful@@ ed by the Ö@@ f@@ teren when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz musical has not brought a top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as his bi@@ ograph this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : when one makes the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one does not have to ask yourself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger occurs at all . &quot;
it &apos;s just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly spoken by any suspic@@ ion of medi@@ ator or fellow @-@ wis@@ er in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
&quot; also , the non @-@ violence in the pres@@ ch@@ schule also arise out of its impact . &quot;
you may be able to hear from it too late or have the first quot@@ ations not taken seriously enough .
&quot; the domain of school , on which he was active , was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents as - so literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thus also the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents an excellent record , &quot; &quot; loved &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
&quot; only a minority is worth of his perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high Emoti@@ on@@ ality , which also has already led to walls . &quot;
&quot; that he did not only cast with chairs and cast lots on the ground , but also ear@@ nest@@ ly distributed and too fre@@ ed guys in hair or ears , he has already been given for years ago , deeply de@@ plor@@ able and exc@@ used for it . &quot;
&quot; but to its hon@@ orary salvation , however , must be told that such educ@@ ators in the fragile time , the 1960s and 1970s were widespread , with parents like with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such a breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us , who was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; also I have experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is actually happening in this report , namely the ent@@ angl@@ ed sexual abuse and non @-@ violence at the pres@@ ch@@ schule , are the free Bag@@ at@@ els . &quot;
&quot; as you ask yourself , whether it is not likely to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ V@@ I. that many media has just returned to him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bav@@ arian pop@@ e , many who never understood it , still have fri@@ ghtened off . &quot;
the truth is : the report ent@@ ails Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the media , the report was reported much about the subject of abuse at the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also does some associations or co @-@ purpose in terms of sexual abuse to the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual over@@ gri@@ ps claims to have become familiar to the domain name .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I have never dre@@ amed to speak with my Father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said a crime dep@@ uty for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
the real problem with clarification of sexual abuse was and yet is that most victims are silent on silence .
&quot; if they are not even familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then no one determines not a ch@@ oral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do you rate the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : a survey disciple form@@ ulating the following : &quot; &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... in any case , in which he answered ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) timely findings and could have had the respective perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to embrace that it is with him ... Bub@@ ble in@@ tru@@ er or more clear or more , than compared to their parents , dormit@@ ories , trust , etc . &quot;
that you speak with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear outcome : &quot; &quot; that the students involved in the advance of affected students and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation . &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger released from any fellow @-@ purpose .
&quot; thus , it cannot be accused , not prevented him or brought to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to connect his good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
in the media was much of &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; at the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will look out in the report . &quot;
do he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the coverage everything is mixed and distor@@ ted to a huge mil@@ king out of sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but that is precisely the abuse of the report .
&quot; namely , there is clean separated : between the pre @-@ school and the Gymnasium of the cathedral sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence , we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report is dealt with inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral leader of the cathedral sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole horrible exam@@ ines , the cases , in which mer@@ ging of s@@ adi@@ stic teachers were regul@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ited , and under@@ gone , all@@ ey@@ ed at the pres@@ ch@@ schule in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to be cured . &quot;
&quot; but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boys only to face when they were already at the domain of the school . &quot;
&quot; on which was how the most of the witnesses emphas@@ ise , the theme &quot; &quot; Vor@@ School &quot; &quot; tab@@ ular . &quot;
&quot; one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment , and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; conditions . &quot;
what was different in the domain of the school ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a discipline , but just none s@@ adi@@ c violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims of the general humanity of R. sch@@ ätz@@ le , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even connect positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; thus , at most , remains the pre @-@ throw away , away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods where it was reported by the states at the Vor@@ School . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the events at a school where he didn &apos;t want to hear and responsible ( so the witness ) nothing wanted to hear , and then again to 1993 . &quot;
wear Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently the ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral @-@ festival , which the report was even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in this he pointed out this point , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school will continue to be practiced &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the face of the risk of negative press , he received an urgent one . &quot;
&quot; of course it was at a time when legal clarity consisted , when the aud@@ itors were also banned in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; before , she caught in a legal grey zone , as each one of us still knows . &quot;
&quot; there was also difficult to estimate for him , where those affected may have exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the permitted border has been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but one cannot say , he would have always been away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the aud@@ iting of schools was officially launched in Bavaria too . &quot;
prin@@ cess Gl@@ oria by Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said yes , it is unfair that today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards apply to the time of time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of the An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; therefore the danger to judge it according to today &apos;s moral labour . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has already been right .
&quot; of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse that was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and also not for what happened in the pre @-@ school of resistance and violence to inno@@ cent children , which goes far beyond that time . &quot;
this is all very terrible and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ working .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take shelter Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; its means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ching , thus ear@@ nest and to pull the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as physical punishment then has been prohibited , he has also kept strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
what picture of his Reg@@ ensburger Zeit has given Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because in discussions with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ?
did the subject test also for language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct X@@ V@@ I. , tells of his perspective , then the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I don &apos;t know at all that he led there a stric@@ ter reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said once more : without these Perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the one &apos;s un@@ condi@@ tional discipline , it would probably hardly have been possible from the until then more national @-@ known Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( 1983 and his musical tradition , which went immediately twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not make any major singers and stand before every success , right in which area , still discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
as what kind of people have you experienced for a book for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , land@@ lords , deep smooth@@ est and sav@@ our@@ able people , from which one could not imagine that he could do just a fly something . &quot;
&quot; I am regularly updated with how many former cathedral sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his em@@ or@@ ting , regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and to treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who did not forgive him until today , that he once was strictly to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and gives them the world of music .
&quot; and that he always was a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ ous teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect @-@ person who had to look at today and to honor them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again quite clearly : all that one thro@@ ws him are educ@@ ators , which were then on the agenda . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and one still prominent brother has to make a medi@@ al sin@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention , which is behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , who has just been released , dis@@ appoint him . &quot;
&quot; now the stand @-@ areas would have been a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria , and maybe Germany would probably not know the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
