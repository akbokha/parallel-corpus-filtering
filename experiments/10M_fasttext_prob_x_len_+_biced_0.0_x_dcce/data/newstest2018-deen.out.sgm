<seg id="37">"for 280 patients first had been place, later on 500 places were expanded."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chalk house in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"there since 2006, the Isar-Amper Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of the largest Psychiatry Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">The area of the former Auer Anstalt will now meet young people in the Münchner Salesium.</seg>

<seg id="50">Citizen-law published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of coloured people is issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri on the basis of discrimination policy and the racist attacks of the State.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to come into force until 28 August 2017, visitors and Missourians, as a number of fragments, ramp@-@ based incidents in recent times throughout the country and here are noted," says it in the opinion of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recent adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder to gain disdiscrimination, as well as the impunity bodies of the state, the disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to make the travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights to happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that has issued the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group quoted incidents like racist enforced against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"in the beginning of the year, Sanders died at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline during the journey by the state, and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri, without a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also shows a recent report of the office of the Office of General Lawyers, which is shown that black motorists in the state 75 percent is more common than pastures."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready whether to bring Cauters or make their relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 Hassverge in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Hassverbreg reporting program of the FBI, which took the state with respect to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to complain a company because of living or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union had published the warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states of immigration laws to commit men because of immigration crimes, resulting in the opinion of the ACLU to further pensions."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings will usually be issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the action as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Crossover project is spontaneous.</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisheracher Weidezvn project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag Peter White and Kordula Kovac has changed a picture on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the Rigrabenhof of the family Schwendemann met representatives of the Fisheracher CDU townships together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann granted first insights into its operation, in which he produces 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk kitchen and also houses many young animals and houses in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "black milk" "is for him the alternative marker marker for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">The table of the guests is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he also has a BLHV-Chairman of Fisbach, he described the Weidecay project as" spontaneous. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not manage on such steep areas not profitable.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green space for a lot of work, much has been dealt with the motor sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the elastic operation and managed this without any chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not lead the biooperation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the ordination project, and is happy about the leader of the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the performance of the areas could be moved even for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure that we have, are people who work in agriculture and make themselves thinking about how to continue their business," said the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers stand because of encouragement often in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the surface area is 40 hectares, which may not be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total amount of 71 500 euros the half was funded by leader, a quarter carried the village of fishing."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers had to invest 12 610 Euro, which had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of Weidezvn."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," stated Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do not make a really good job, without farmers and land."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter White stand firm:" "here the best food is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">Landscapes (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of pastures.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the disclosure of the Schwarzwalds.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR remarked conveyance.</seg>
<seg id="94">"moreover, the wrong area may not be unepishable (Hanging over 35 percent) and must be threatened by the performance."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fisherman Weidezaunching project 2018, the application of eight participants are currently running with 24 plots, which are just under 16 kilometers fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the surface area corresponds to 35 hectares, the cold cost of more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence, the careful overthrow Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he did a symbolic Axt in a hitous dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the President to the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller does not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">"a horde of boat owners and Liberty importers would have suffered him, if he had done it."</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid their significance, and especially the meaning that you have been written as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, has been added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta:" I don't want to go here on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that is illuminated the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem which you refer to, which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is not really true, but as he formulate it, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the shook words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state would not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your fatigue, your poor, / your arms, freely to breathe / the elonging waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There has never been a time in which the "eldest waste" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller has not committed himself in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural examination: it is indeed a conflict with the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well that they were a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by presented the female embodiment of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives himself a completely different name: mother of Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people wanted to change from the right wing this long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a sort of Johannes the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not one-conservative, but rather an early neoconservatives that bring American flame into the remarked world." Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It shall bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something engraved.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and certainly a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative fact of Lazarus consisted of removing them to see how they were seen by the exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the deks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people, looking for refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective of recognise Miller and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="127">"your Fackel is not supposed to enlighten the way, but the hatred, which is their only source of power, ignite."</seg>
<seg id="128">WHC 2017: Neil Black loaves Scottish members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle reminding itself at a time when only two villi belonging to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance Director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-heads of the World Championship has a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"Black believes that" "in Scotland something special" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand and we will continue it, until we find it out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is absolutely brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m line, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the crew to the team leader."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were narrow, or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and genuine feeling, the Eilidh was completely natural, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth of silver medals in its fifth World Championships, in the 400-m hurdles, says that it's" unbelievable, "that 16 carrots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's largest number of athletes in the world championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The midsection Muir runs on this path and has placed five British and two European records over the past year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, is another shot that one should be observed after a great season that would be the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">"Doyle remembered their first world Championships, as the only other soons in the team Lee McConnell."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the Mannist capitals says that they are" "enormously proud" "to the fact that many of their landlords are not only part of the team, but in some cases also among the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special about to be part of the team that was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was anyway a great honor, but to know that my team mates voted for me and chose me, makes it something special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as an established athletes, athletes who want to rise on Podium."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to put on this home support and benefit that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere, out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics concerning Facebook: don't carry you a public office if you cannot wear the heating of the voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers swallow him because of all, from interior policies to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he resigned with criticism, secure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783, Washington said:" "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we will run like the sheep to the battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland at Governor Larry Hogan, who must work on it, more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defendant him from the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the stab of the Governors left the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of an object with" "Well, and?". ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if there is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a Republique Governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his haarless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore the blockages of persons who come to the side of the governors - which is officially referred to as an official forum, which is officially referred to as officially and by workers who are paid with public tax currency - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Chasse Chasse the actions of the Governors and argued that the blockages of comments is nothing more than a moderator."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trout or spammers or hedge-filled people, who vibrate online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said, that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profited."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appliance to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyers in Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hedge-filled, but she asked to break down."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current messages," "wrote them in the commentary box of the news" "The Post." ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people is taking place on the same issue, it is regarded as a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employee of the Governors identified as" "concentrated spam attack", "would others probably call" "pronunciation." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocks a critics or deleted a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner as in former time, if one had done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guidance and to burn or burn demonstrators and to silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what happens digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials to criticise his Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is contracted by Twitter users who have been blocked by its Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the President of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County last the first Amendment, according to U.S. district, James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she called a voters from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Prein (R) was also a visit to the ACLU for its use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be as difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous briefing smote to his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people, the pseudonyme like" Juricola, "" Belisarius "," Belisarius "and" Portius "," wrote all letters of newspapers, the Washington's decisions made. "</seg>
<seg id="202">"petition, who criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and navigation with the UK, overwhelmed by the historical documents that were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not brought them to silence.</seg>

<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship to television extends decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his television is still strong."</seg>

<seg id="1407">"Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants, the President of strategic reasons to pervable information."</seg>

<seg id="1410">"this happened at the end of February, when someone gave the President malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C.

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist emphasized the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet in order to examine their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what is more secure: they should take their children to the office, who were the goal of an attack with granulates, or make them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporter, name for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drugs regulators, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected, on the secret list of the government or the cartels, which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no relaxing break from the violence, and throughout the land the corpses, are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 gave his ministry for attacks and threats under Federal protection, and until now there was at least seven dead in seven states this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"under the latter, their editors and their Inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence will be deep received, although its presence is everywhere present - a large photo by Valdez, which shows its centerfinger with the word" Justice "building. two Reporter in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panams."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 has been established a special federal prosecution in order to process the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee to protect journalists have only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of Morden, which are linked to drug trading and organised crime, the murderers of journalists will rarely be brought to trial."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still insist on to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforged and although the terrain is now even traocated."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers of justice, without justice, the meeting has little benefits for discussion, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid, to wasting my time in this workshop," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we distrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of May 15th Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks away before the red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car, and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - the" "Twelded river". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap drove away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He leaves a woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to be free in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans dearrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January was Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battling fields of the country, since rivalisitive factions are struggling to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"there is nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the graveyard is full of verted, two-storey Mausoleen for drug king, which are bigger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs-trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the release of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling boxes in the war with Guzmans's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may be annoyed the sons, suspected number of members bought each copy of the output, as soon as they were delivered on time boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez, after the confiscation of a different newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country on its own safety."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">"he had long survived his friends and colleagues, that he would always be there."</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, as he joined together with five colleagues at the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to operate journalism without to encounter the smoker problem," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time the newspaper deserved a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and revenues and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it, able to publish hard meetings without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else treat them."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history, wherever they led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave voluntarily to that he had fear.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You must assume the task that falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked:" "what did you do with so many stills... why did you not say what was going out before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missing Valdez, the Spaak bird, who was like a port worker, the friend, the generous with hugs and advice, a teacher that knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, go and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"well, ask them: was his love for routine his entail?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also has forced them to ask her own assumptions to question how they can do their work best and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their hard-runners and cross-debate, to employ drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censor and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust in his own instinaries.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it. "</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that" smell can be a sense of dreamed... and then the thing with Javier has happened. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa no longer - just as in Tamaulipas, VERACRUZ, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government bodies at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>

<seg id="1873">"half in the Scherz, some of the reporters asked whether this officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, who referred to the Governor themselves as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug control de facto are under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week Riodoce has drilled over three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an Exposé to the prosecutors who concentrated on the home city of the Governors.</seg>

<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who has been kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drug operators and authorities."</seg>

<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in this eatery, including one, in which a son of" "El Chapo" Guzman took a military transition. "</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months before, the readers would have seen the Kolumne of Valdez as the best informed source about the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had already knew what is happening," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "" El FLACO "" because of its slim body. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez has been dedicated to storage space for signs and sticker to protest against the Morde of journalists, because the employees have become something that they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>

<seg id="1895">"in his last book" "Narco-Journalism" "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug addities, but also on the command of politicians and security guards, which organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>

<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile and they still watch the streets and are looking for dangers.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic is the end-on plant-nivores the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed like the surrounding rocks at the Platze, and decided to look more accurately."</seg>
<seg id="1932">That was discovered by him Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy peumphs."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just have a little with the eyes of blinks, you could almost believe it slept," said the captain Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to see. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">It is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs copies - the mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant-fresser, although he is covered with a armor, and a changing tank is likely to be threatened by meat-filled dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the highly-arched dinosaurs used to hide a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used to hide a shielding technology, which is used as a counterparty which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have been allowed to mix themselves better in its surroundings and to soak its enemies, say experts, which indicates that it has been threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurier made the headlines in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it Borealopelta markchelli was named after the museum techniques Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it to Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists who document patterns and shape of scales and armour about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the conshady, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature darker was as its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the conshady usual is common, the results are surprisingly, as the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living in today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs was hooked by enough pressure through meat-nivordinosaurs that the evolution favoured the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter shaded - think of deer, zebras or shortward - are much smaller and vulnerable as prey, which signalizes that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong booty behavior on a massive, strongly armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs prey of the circle must have been," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists still examine the animal in evidence of his life, including his current Darminum, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, driven into a river and went out into the sea, where he sank in the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans probably much more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preservated skin, but also in three dimensions, and the original form of the animal retains," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost as exactly as in the early roundabout.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just have a little with the eyes, you could almost believe he is on sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time, as huge Theropoda, the carnivorous dinals, which stood on two legs, went through earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta lived, the ardised dinosaurs was hunted by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear, believe that Borealopelta was silenced after the death of the sea and in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the worrying dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armaments, and is complete from the muzzle to the hips."</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3.000 pounds (1.300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It enths two 20-inch-long peaks that raged by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the ardised plant-nivores was shouted by the Western Canada, until a flooded river floods it into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaurs keep his armour in an exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The hidden remnants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the doorway still hollowing along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the Lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I do it, the confusing it will be."</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to their core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"only one day after they arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis Gebate on the bed of an Airbnb apartment which she rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">You stumbled across a post from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year child, and it still lies on the road."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, as no one was posted on her Feed the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retched on its timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the Rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year-old, who was killed by a white police officers in Ferguson, Mo., was killed, live to tweets."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted an image of Browning's lebrid body that was outstretched on the street and would stay four hours there.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," thought Ferrell at itself. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone to return later in the evening tweet on people on the Canfield drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos from the police band and people, the cried, and from a man who said to his father, who took a sign with the wording:" Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">You watched a live Feed in which a policeman stood before a group of protesters with a bellish dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, unattended another policeman his rifle and crying:" I will all kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common, it reminded Ferrell at its statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to ourselves and that we can call it typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt shook.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a flight back and went home next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father, and decided that the two will drive the next morning to Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," "Whose Streets?", "in the cinemas on the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, of love and loss, the strength and resistance, which consists of the perspective of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to challenge answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a Ferrel with her daughter who brought a floral dress, and a suitable crown carried away, after Ferguson, the two one conversation that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember, as I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" remember what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are now going to Ferguson, because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy, and that was not correct."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">That which is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and moved them to it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience an ecatant racism, it is no different than the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove her a bad service to keep them far away."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop, when they arrived at Ferguson, was found at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that was transformed into a camps as the activists to the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner, who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets before and halves to pass it to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to accept a new kind of activism for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed completely after the 9th of August, she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in Organise.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only" "documented" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came from Ferrell in the sense:" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of White - in a community that benefited from her pain and their resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently explained in an interview:" we heard that people who have been born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area, which is known for its activism by death trap."</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought together Ferrell the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, as I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was to focus on a Ferrer experience - to show that it is in motion" not around a Messiah leader, but about a community that comes together, "" Folayan - it proved to be the apparent participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferryells life as they love themselves and their wife marries."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked", "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that at this work, I have to give a certain vulnerability in this work and the human being."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells history plays the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of black Teenagers Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media, identify themselves as sulul."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly struggling with different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" the movement is really kept by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it is obvious that" this is not a affirmation type of action, which was chosen as the heart of the film due to their identity as the heart of the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy, she said."</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, though she was at the forefront, because with a life at these crosses as a black, vibrule woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel her energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile the news cameras have disappeared in Ferguson, but the racist connections between the community and the police continue to persist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on granting for 2 ½ years due to the block of a highway on a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"it describes the social policy atmosphere of the area, called her home:" a mess "." "</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, they clammates to a vocals and she feels committed to this memory, since then she went on the road three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size wahn": TV-reader discuss over bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit-gallery moves the people although it is not yet built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south-edge of the pedestrian zone has been divides since the first presentation 2009 the population in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the issue hardly any.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"also on our Facebook page" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "will be discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"say the one to the bit 'gallery:" that would be a dream "" (Anja Becker) or "" This would be real "" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side, "" does not need a man "(Siggi leg!" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the proponents are building that a gallery draws more customers to the city, of which also the other business benefit, fear the opponent's pedestrian bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery will be exactly planned on the plot, on which the farm market stands, in the 13 directional market market its products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of construction work will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery-makers want to integrate a Markthal in the new building - and at the Beda place with opportunity to go out sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been buying a weekly market for many years now.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the countryside always happy to be very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether to market direct market in a Markthalle in the gallery, comes to the amount of rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this might not be low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what's shopping basket in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drapes or supermarket: I find the superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">But you see how many shoppers will be empty - some have been working here for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since it is not even a short weekly market, it is all the more important that we can at least get the market hall at least."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered are fresh, is largely offered directly from the producers and is obendlessly inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, store stores in a shopping centre only collect from larger companies, as the dorm are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special stores there is almost no longer and what is still remaining, will probably still disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a Markthalle does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Most of all: where should the farmers market hall during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution, even if the bit-gallery will actually come."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"or does it create the ghost bit gallery previously, all the shops from Bitburg to sell?"</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, does not need any one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farm market it is thanks to the wahnsiness many - as I find - pointless construction projects in Bitburg no place anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmhouses is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A perfect similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost insignificant - that hang out of the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist in Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupppers and hairsections that were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former Secret service Analytics sent a 35-year-old prison sentence after they made a secret diplomatic reports on the website WikiLeaks."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey Hagborg, whose discipline has transformed their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and curriculum, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey Hagborg has been extracted by the algorithms of DNA that was extracted by Manning, like someone with these genomic data might look like someone with these genomic data - the many ways that may be interpreted and the intougher determinism of this interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about the identification as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 because of 20 charges, including six violations against the espionagegetz, computer was and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"by the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a granting, black-white Selfie, in which Manning is intentionally sitting on a driver seat and a platinblonde Perücke carries - with which it was associated with."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project "stranger Visions."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist in portraits of strangers from forensky artifacts like cigarette mute and chewing gum, extracted the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when they received an e-mail from a timeframe.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at this time, and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea, and asked if they wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist, and their detainted Muse were passed to unequal penpal, which in the course of two years several letters interchangeable."</seg>
<seg id="2139">She created even one of Shoili Kanungo Illustrierte Comic "Suppressed Images," which a future foresaw in which the president would convert Chelation judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning release after seven brutal years would demand in a military coup in Kansas was a welcome kind of happier."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also a little deeper and starting at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camps and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to remedy the rigid divisions, which he should actually remedy."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"as Dewey Hagborg after the stranger Timing of all these things was asked, she said that" things happen from a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery the written artistic statement called Manning with her superior subordinance (the" "i" "in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of" automatic fragmentation, whose basis gender, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and GS and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey Hagborg hoped, showing the inclusion of the 200 letters (or cloteotide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), like amazing similarly, at least in biological regard, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take, is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective them are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in an own room, is one page from the above mentioned Comic-Novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she appears with a free phone calls in the hand from the discipline of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they speak your speech, then they have won."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never before the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote me," "said the artist who greet from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I am still going to godly, if I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it's forestry in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed into the center of the space of masks, from their own genomical simulator that merges themselves like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also purposeful as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), which were written with pencil on their genetic hloaders. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted it to feel like a crowds", "said Dewey Hagborg from the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to be like a mass movement, which forming themselves with Chelsea, such as the movement, which was also hidden behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies supply a lot of it and we will see them much more frequent," said Mr Sharkey when the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">"modern sexpuppets have evolved from their inflatable partners to robotic partners with a silicate foreskin, which feels warm feeling - with consciously human reactions, which can be achieved by the artificial intelligence."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help, IBD (inflammation) to linders"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom of 300.000, causes stomach struggles, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"during those affected people normally get meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University that contributes to the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins that promote an tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the researcher researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol to make sure that harmful microbes, which are hidden in the body, not in the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to trigger inflammations, are balanced by cells, which promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far toward inflammation, it may result a inflammatory disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experimentation has been determined that a sort of tolerance conduciple immune cell on mice occurs which carry a certain bacterium in their entries.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the components of proteins in order to dissolve the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more Tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and one of Tryptophan was tolerant diet-tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal flows, if the same system also wires with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that helped the tolerance as they found that a group of study tastes such cells had, but another group of the same trunk, which had not been separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the stomach-intestinal tract. "</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the scissors of the mice were found DNA sequencing, and they were found six bacterial species that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them with the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterilous environment so that they did not develop an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria focused on the immune system, the researchers L. reuther grow in a liquid, and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells develop into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the fluid was purified, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-metabolism that is known as Indol-3-acid-acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers have double the amount of tryptophan in the forage of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophans were halved, the number of cells declined by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us protect us L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tractors."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether to develop tryptophan by L. reuteri the cells in people as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to Tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory performers."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines. "</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophans can lead to a expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri.</seg>

<seg id="2885">"the driver of the opposite automobile, a Mercedes Benz, had outdated a truck and continued his drive without taking care of the traffic accident."</seg>
<seg id="2886">It may be good for the accident that the Mercedar had not noticed the accident at all.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report" Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger "</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuses of Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abscandal with the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions with the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement" We are Church, "explained by former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-year's brother of Benedict XVI, an excuse."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church, when Müller and Ratzinger their deep regret would express their deep omissions or their then false assessment of processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican Council "Osservatore Romano" on the other hand criticized that in the reporting of violence at the cathedral spatzen with "two thirds."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"regarding the grips in Regensburg, none that it would have to be punched and shameful deeds" handle, that would have to be punished, but the "degree of medial manipulation," was the "degree of medial manipulation," historians, and a member of the National Italian bioethics committees. "</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all exercise, is already part of all-day experience and preparing public opinion that is normal for normal", "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we would be happy to go to the church and that's a packed Fressen.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"moreover, they pointed out that in her youth" "saw a quite normal pedagogical means" "to be with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abused cases often the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger is often found.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"totally wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who written with Ratzinger the reminder" My brother of Pope "(in 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all that had nothing to do with him," it adds value the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly is in the 440-page report, which is presented by Bistum Regensburg with the clarification of the lawyer of Ulrich Weber?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and early 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it means to Georg Ratzinger, which was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" "in conclusion, so that from Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high Emotionality, the punishment for the students could also fall fierce."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other allegations, many victims caused the general humanity of R. Burns, and therefore, in many cases, despite force, even positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in an interview, Hesemann, why the final report on the absentencing scandal made at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-pages report on the" prevention of non-violence in protective elements at Regensburger Domspatzen "gives a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for a great deal of students, his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"to the other, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist who has been handfuled by the Öfteren when a Domspatz musical has not brought a top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biograph this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: when one makes the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one does not have to ask yourself, why the name Georg Ratzinger occurs at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">It's just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly spoken by any suspicion of mediator or fellow-wiser in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">"also, the non-violence in the preschschule also arise out of its impact."</seg>
<seg id="2916">You may be able to hear from it too late or have the first quotations not taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the domain of school, on which he was active, was perceived by practically all respondents as - so literally -" salvation, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"thus also the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger presents an excellent record," "loved", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "and" always surrounded by grapes of children. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority is worth of his perfectionism and its high Emotionality, which also has already led to walls."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only cast with chairs and cast lots on the ground, but also earnestly distributed and too freed guys in hair or ears, he has already been given for years ago, deeply deplorable and excused for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"but to its honorary salvation, however, must be told that such educators in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s were widespread, with parents like with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such a breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us, who was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"also I have experienced this in a worldly school, a state Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is actually happening in this report, namely the entangled sexual abuse and non-violence at the preschschule, are the free Bagatels."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"as you ask yourself, whether it is not likely to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedikt XVI. that many media has just returned to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian pope, many who never understood it, still have frightened off."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report entails Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, the report was reported much about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also does some associations or co-purpose in terms of sexual abuse to the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual overgrips claims to have become familiar to the domain name.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dreamed to speak with my Father or my mother," "said a crime deputy for the others," It was all very embarrassing. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with clarification of sexual abuse was and yet is that most victims are silent on silence.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they are not even familiar with parents and siblings, then no one determines not a choral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate the Domspatzen students Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">"Michael Hesemann: a survey disciple formulating the following:" "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... in any case, in which he answered (Georg Ratzinger) timely findings and could have had the respective perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to embrace that it is with him... Bubble intruer or more clear or more, than compared to their parents, dormitories, trust, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you speak with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report comes to the very clear outcome:" "that the students involved in the advance of affected students and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned is Georg Ratzinger released from any fellow-purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, it cannot be accused, not prevented him or brought to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to connect his good name with these contradictory crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media was much of "non-violence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will look out in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the coverage everything is mixed and distorted to a huge milking out of sexual abuse and non-violence and somewhere, in the middle of, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there is clean separated: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the cathedral spatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report is dealt with incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral leader of the cathedral spatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible examines, the cases, in which merging of sadistic teachers were regulated and malignited, and undergone, alleyed at the preschschule in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to be cured."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boys only to face when they were already at the domain of the school."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on which was how the most of the witnesses emphasise, the theme" "VorSchool" "tabular."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment, and for many even" heavenly "conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the domain of the school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline, but just none sadic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims of the general humanity of R. schätzle, and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even connect positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, at most, remains the pre-throw away, away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods where it was reported by the states at the VorSchool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time 1970 / 71 when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the events at a school where he didn't want to hear and responsible (so the witness) nothing wanted to hear, and then again to 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Wear Georg Ratzinger consistently the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral-festival, which the report was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he pointed out this point," that in the pre-school will continue to be practiced "." "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in the face of the risk of negative press, he received an urgent one."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"of course it was at a time when legal clarity consisted, when the auditors were also banned in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before, she caught in a legal grey zone, as each one of us still knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was also difficult to estimate for him, where those affected may have exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permitted border has been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one cannot say, he would have always been away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the auditing of schools was officially launched in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria by Thurn und Taxis said yes, it is unfair that today's pedagogical standards apply to the time of time. "</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "Fallstrick of the Anachronism", "therefore the danger to judge it according to today's moral labour."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse that was abominable at all times, and also not for what happened in the pre-school of resistance and violence to innocent children, which goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very terrible and I am glad that it will finally be reworking.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take shelter Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"its means of disciplining and punching, thus earnest and to pull the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as physical punishment then has been prohibited, he has also kept strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">What picture of his Regensburger Zeit has given Georg Ratzinger because in discussions with you for the book "My brother of Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject test also for language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI., tells of his perspective, then the Domspatzen played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I don't know at all that he led there a stricter regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said once more: without these Perfectionism, without the one's unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly have been possible from the until then more national-known Regensburger Domspatzen (1983 and his musical tradition, which went immediately twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone, one does not make any major singers and stand before every success, right in which area, still discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what kind of people have you experienced for a book for Georg Ratzinger?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I met Georg Ratzinger really well and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, landlords, deep smoothest and savourable people, from which one could not imagine that he could do just a fly something."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I am regularly updated with how many former cathedral spatzen still today, 23 years after his emorting, regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and to treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who did not forgive him until today, that he once was strictly to them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and gives them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, väterous teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respect-person who had to look at today and to honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again quite clearly: all that one throws him are educators, which were then on the agenda."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and one still prominent brother has to make a medial sinner."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intention, which is behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, who has just been released, disappoint him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the stand-areas would have been a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria, and maybe Germany would probably not know the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
