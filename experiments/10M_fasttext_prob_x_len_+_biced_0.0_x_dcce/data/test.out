this has made clear the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambig@@ uous .
&quot; I will always be plug@@ ged in dra@@ wer or sticks from the outside label , which have usually little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire , always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , these things are more straightforward . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only lau@@ gh that she is regarded as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as they are in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pyramid pyramid
his experiences on the horse are over@@ looked .
&quot; at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sear@@ ched with some colleagues a bit of change along the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Spor@@ tp@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes the horses were reminded of their holiday , she said at home in fast g@@ allo@@ p home at the feed tr@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I have had fear . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and thus the horse @-@ career ended up again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer at all times - 101 tournament will be back in the vicinity of horses .
he left himself with his family over the system of the AL@@ RV on a horse he didn &apos;t get to photograph .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German spor@@ ts@@ aid took the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small g@@ ala with the Golden Spor@@ tp@@ pyramid .
to the awards it lacks the li@@ ke@@ able ath@@ l@@ ete .
Bundes@@ daten@@ schutz@@ kreu@@ z , Silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has turned him up .
long is the 18th prize winners of the sport pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winners Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award means me a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger encourages the offspring .
and so he gave the prize money from 25.000 Euro to the same .
&quot; with 15 further outstanding sports , the two @-@ fold U.S. master winner was recorded on Saturday into the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the excellent include the Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ eten Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the F@@ isher Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the jumping Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the palms of all Erhard . &quot;
many of these spor@@ tsmen have arrived on Saturday after Aachen .
after the official part the illustr@@ ating society went to the Spring@@ on where the Lav@@ azza Prize ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policies in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the TT@@ P trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; however , the two US presidential policy are in control and energy policy as well as in a basic question . &quot;
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosop@@ hical difference . &quot;
the role of the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt more small and war@@ ns how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton would raise the economy to death and adjust to death he says .
&quot; he himself against it would be quite different , claims Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely return regul@@ ators , and he makes for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax evasion strong - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton against it says : the state has specific tasks to fulfill , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the nuts , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost exactly what is equal . &quot;
the democratic Candi@@ date announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected about the state of the state of the Republi@@ cans .
&quot; so on Tru@@ mp , there could be also partial internal discussions . &quot;
more evident are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ power plants and rebuild coal production in the United States .
oil @-@ funding should also be possible in so far @-@ protected areas to termin@@ ate the Paris climate agreement .
&quot; Clinton , on the contrary , with its Investment Programme explicitly wants to expand its renewable energies and calls for : &quot; a country becomes the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other .
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US do not want to isol@@ ate the U.S. from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs . &quot;
those are to be paid even better for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hungry .
it wants to increase it on 15 dollars a hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be , then he says he could not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months would probably be likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand is Tru@@ mp , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics stand before him , so that the budget deficit would be even bigger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , which at least want to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who fl@@ ee alone , almost already to everyday life . &quot;
when they arrive in Germany they are often traum@@ atis@@ ed .
a house offers refu@@ ge .
in a large kitchen four women are sitting .
&quot; each has a baby , the most a year old . &quot;
one has placed her little son in the arm .
he gu@@ ed with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother rigi@@ d on the top @-@ top .
until they notice that she is observed .
they sm@@ elt short and kis@@ sing the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is a member of Con@@ dro@@ bs by Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for Social Help offers in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the escape . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are whis@@ per@@ ed .
&quot; they live in the Mün@@ ch@@ ner north , in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs set up the furnishings together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner &apos;s wife .
unfortunately she was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is an Wach@@ mann in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here , has made their escape experience with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr &quot;
&quot; men fl@@ ee for wars because they are persec@@ uted , because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as a hop@@ pers to Europe , &quot; she tells them . &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many are secre@@ tly secre@@ tly , because they do not see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in her native homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced to see hon@@ orary wheat , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is driving them away .
on the escape goes on .
&quot; that tractor for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act , is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they were in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; again , all women in refugees would often be regarded as in@@ fer@@ ior and wor@@ sen@@ ing if ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this leads to that about 90 percent of women who live in the residence in the Mün@@ ch@@ ner north , appreci@@ ates them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women were so usual there they say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t like to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often do not help to help , there are more accommodations just for them , requests . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven districts governing the accommodation of refugees are responsible . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is such a thing that does not exist in accommodations of governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Schw@@ aben , women are not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the government . &quot;
&quot; in some communal accommodation units , under@@ mining or private houses are available only for all women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
also the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study that was published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy or men and women are missing together , it can come to - continuous - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel like this protection can be felt , it is possible to take place at the con@@ j@@ umped age , which there is to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since itself has been around us that there is us , we have a long waiting time , &quot; says B@@ ahr &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assistance strike : demands for new working @-@ operation measures
&quot; dep@@ uty members of the Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists have called their trade union to develop new labour measures , with their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot;
&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded his entire Council , from early September . &quot;
&quot; the J@@ DC said that there had been dre@@ amed of Ministers , to address the concerns relating to the contract . &quot;
&quot; assistance and medical students have been coordinated in July over the ref@@ us@@ al of a contract , which was agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , said the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government was &quot; &quot; per@@ sever@@ ently quiet &quot; &quot; to have problems which led the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; given the J@@ DC Board of Directors to reject the proposed new contract completely reject and official new negotiations with all your acids are concerned . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board adopted today a formal application for a special meeting of BM@@ A Council to become a continuous program of escal@@ ating labour measures which starts in early September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to that Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ thalm@@ ologists this year in sixth strike , the first total accidents in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the BM@@ A Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ebra Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came after the election to rejection of the agreed agreement , which were recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , who took even before the vote by 54.@@ 000 Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ thalm@@ ologists and medical students , with that the contract should be advantageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; following the vote , the Minister of Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt , that the contract for doctors in England would not be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of foreign companies &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands , and announce an official end of the eight months long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counter@@ player in the golden Hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in receiving , I cannot blame myself that Ankara wants most reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile was narro@@ wer and he was shining bright heat , even for its backward circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; he also spoke that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better to improve . &quot;
the next day described a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan would have heard so I would never do something worse .
it seemed to be rather the opposite to me .
&quot; but one of Putin radi@@ ant , sustainable radi@@ le showed that the state of Russia had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first one that he mentioned in his introductory accus@@ ations : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ burned .
&quot; Putin distributed and accused Ankara , to like Russia in the back . &quot;
&quot; this was even bigger , because it was committed by a said friend . &quot;
the Vet@@ r@@ ust rebuild it again becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; months long , the nation@@ ally controlled media led a fier@@ ce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed to be the Turks for all the guilt . &quot;
&quot; most likely , the accus@@ ations of leading officials from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria could have benef@@ ited from the so @-@ called Islam@@ ic state . &quot;
he has denied this veh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it is time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of Erdo@@ gan , which he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a c@@ eas@@ e@@ fire clearly lie on hand .
&quot; Erdo@@ gan takes first and foremost all friends , which he can get after the last month in a failed coup d &apos;@@ reich almost his ministry . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken it .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions did Turkey hit Turkey - especially the ban of charter excursions that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is reduced by nearly 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated if the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
it count on a late attack on the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week projected the remote , cheap fruits and vegetables , once the Turkish agr@@ arian imported again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulations it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West as its response to the tried to prove tak@@ eover as a weak response .
&quot; in addition , the continued Gro@@ ll come across the sn@@ ail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ geon that is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
the Russian state of state in Ankara won a bonus that he called for the tried coup d support for the elected government bodies .
&quot; this is a self @-@ understanding of Moscow , which even has a profound fear of reg@@ im@@ inary . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace made by the sea ; it was Russia and Turkey , one as described as a analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of extr@@ usion &quot; : two countries , who encounter themselves from the West and feel poorly treated and are now verbal . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still differences between the two still great differences . &quot;
&quot; the largest difference in Syria , where Moscow has recently been playing the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposition parties . &quot;
&quot; it could be noted that after almost three hours of initial talks , both Presidents said at the press conference , that they could not have a call . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey for@@ ged it to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disp@@ aster , as NATO member Turkey took the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least once again talk . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for clients outside Scotland is no longer available
the R@@ BS brand is supposed to be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the pres@@ ump@@ er@@ ef of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the brand R@@ BS were connected to the global ambitions of the bank .
&quot; since then , the Bank has been dist@@ anced since eight years ago and had to be saved . &quot;
&quot; at this time , trademarks &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have to be used to protect other end @-@ free financial brands . &quot;
&quot; they supported international sport with millions of pounds on sponsorship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ bl@@ edon winner Andy Murray . &quot;
but now it has decided to put more national brands into the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized head@@ quarter and the stock exchange of so@@ dium . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for private customer business , which will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be part of our Invest@@ ors &apos; brand as well as the brand , where our employees will be busy , as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank has become a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say that we do not pursue a global goals , but to pursue local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers among these brands .
&quot; R@@ BS has already said that its Six Nations sponsorship will no longer be continued , and that it will increase the percep@@ bility of the various brands in his sport sponsorship . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to develop the brands of brands because how do we focus inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the pres@@ ef . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ fied three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and would have such brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , think I will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can restore these brands again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieved on Pre@@ dil@@ ection his 3.@@ 000@@ ten profit in New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spr@@ ing@@ champagne after a double with New@@ market , which brings to him 3.@@ 000@@ ten profit &quot;
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori served on Friday its 3.@@ 000@@ ten British profit in New@@ market .
&quot; he set on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second profit of the night a milestone . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year old Itali@@ ans is the sixth Jo@@ ckey , who reached the milestone in the flat @-@ race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the triple winner of D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won to G@@ ha@@ y@@ yar , said : &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
&quot; I am very happy that it is done with New@@ market , because I am talking about 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a great meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers when he took the victory for victory
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacles - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who finished more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a recru@@ iting career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth of Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 car@@ r@@ ite &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ys of modernity and it is not a surprise that he reached this milestone only a few before him .
&quot; it has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that differs from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic amb@@ assador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma fans loved fans for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 profits , if he would not only be a weekend and Grand@@ tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already suffered a winner in the UK nearly 30 years of winning .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a brilliant race , but in addition he is an incredible yo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ mo@@ unts and Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of British flat building for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournament win , including its famous &quot; Gl@@ or@@ rich Si@@ eben &quot; in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and was offered a drug . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six@@ ties , but he showed an impressive strength to de@@ fi@@ zen his branches and to return to its continu@@ ance . &quot;
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russia Putin Dr@@ ert Stab@@ sch@@ ef Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has released his St@@ ef Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years of the closest trust of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special commission@@ er for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin has formally ordered his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidency . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who was Deputy since 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s was appointed to his successor .
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital city of Tallinn , he made his completion at the renowned state of Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) , and worked in the embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later proclaimed the chief manager and staff of the government . &quot;
&quot; about his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; thanks for your trust . &quot;
&quot; I think that it is the most important task of the government to support its activity as a state of state , and controls the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended v@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has taken Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest Vladimir Putin and works as he worked for the Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB . &quot;
as a staff he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
&quot; in a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on TV , claimed both men that the St@@ ef has resign@@ ed on his own wish . &quot;
&quot; but despite the gaps for cameras , here are only a few of them now - just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is this the result of a kind of power of power ?
the white currently nobody knows .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once upon as a potential president , who wants to lead to the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks in Putin , who are c@@ ited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said it &apos;s true that I have asked you in early 2012 in a conversation I could almost tell me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ ained post four years long . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been President of the Russian committee for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
before he was Deputy Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the state security service of K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov appointed his dep@@ uty . &quot;
&quot; as Putin to the power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , to whom he was most familiar . &quot;
&quot; once was believed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term Putin had signed up against the Constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , seam@@ less ally put@@ into , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before he became president for three and a half years later .
Criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son filmed after he made producers
Gib@@ son participated last month at a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios which manufacture the series announced in a joint statement of his cancellation .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ ch@@ ner , ap@@ olog@@ ised on Thursday before the notice of his cancellation . &quot;

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have linked the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ a@@ duct - which means the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four finishing the &quot; &quot; cover &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the quar@@ k section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 ton .
&quot; he has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 shr@@ ubs . &quot;
the £ 1,35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; Minister Keit@@ h Brown , the construction site was visiting today and was one of the first to went out of the land on the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineer of a truly ep@@ ic degree in this project with more than 30.000 ton concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the wear between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the lo@@ sto@@ ck a hom@@ age activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; a total of almost 79 % of the total bracel@@ ets is placed at their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks , today in Ros@@ y@@ th a beg@@ ong@@ ate for the Deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Le@@ aders of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first verse provides a significant milestone at each wheel project . &quot;
in this fantastic project the closure is tr@@ end@@ setting up @-@ tr@@ end@@ - and low @-@ building .
&quot; after installing the last tram cut and its connection with the North @-@ deck area , we had to close the existing gap on the north or land side . &quot;
this was achieved by drag@@ ging the northern draw@@ backs 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very hom@@ k@@ le activity .
&quot; massi@@ vely , as the Vi@@ a@@ du@@ kt 222 meters long , ca . 6,000 tonnes weighs and had to be drawn up at a slope of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; sancti@@ fy since the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , tiny -- on each page they buried them only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue at the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have good luck to be alive
&quot; three men have good luck to be alive , after they were thrown by the fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI life@@ jack@@ et proposed on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alarm , after the crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay . &quot;
&quot; the three men had difficulty to swim in security , while their boat moving from their own power . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat near itself and presented us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds of Win@@ ds have already gained the boat except for its reach , until we left the water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved from a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found at a bu@@ oy without life@@ jack@@ et . &quot;
they all came on board of the coastal ret@@ ots and were brought back to the lif@@ ebo@@ at station
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water , are lucky in@@ ju@@ red and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat @-@ engine had a sti@@ p@@ ation , but these holes are loos@@ ed at the ken@@ ing of the boat from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has won over these men today .
tough in@@ ju@@ red - man sti@@ cht on his ex @-@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; like the police yesterday afternoon , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the cut of non @-@ alcoholic , the clothes of his ex @-@ friend . &quot;
&quot; when this came into the apartment , he returned twice to her . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was in@@ ju@@ red by hand and on the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ friend were destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ armed with its sister .
&quot; together with her life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her life .
on the road they met the ex @-@ way of the man .
&quot; when the two women re@@ mar@@ ry the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister to the side and handle his ex @-@ friend . &quot;
who is building up to affordable housing ?
&quot; in future , the SPD and green : investors should be taken much stronger in the future . &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 apartments in the coming years ?
&quot; the SPD suggests a &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; at the next meeting . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; SPD &apos;s Chairman of Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build urban areas in the future , must show 20 percent of all the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the affordable housing can also occur in the stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the great dispute point in the city hall is however , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; how to deal with investors to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build such areas at least 10 per cent , but as 20 per cent of the apartments are building as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing structure , which will cost millions of costs and will be financed , should ensure incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the groups . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the Left wants even tough@@ ness for investors .
&quot; regardless of it , so Brat@@ mann , a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the scope of action is implemented , the system will ensure additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the experts .
&quot; yet the program is not entirely different : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but how does one compare the loss of further approximately 1300 apartments whose promotion will be running in the coming years ?
it will be 500 apartments alone until the year 2020 .
&quot; to prevent this , so the planned policy speaker , Nicole Palm , should now purchase orders from the city now . &quot;
&quot; in addition , apartments would have to be thought to pick up apartments back to the pricing . &quot;
this is possible in the West town .
one fell sw@@ oop to the problem .
because in the West stadt the yearly deadlines are running .
&quot; about 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price of price for cheap apartments . &quot;
&quot; only : these are the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; for the number of social housing in the West Town is dramatically increased dramatically , one is removed from the objective of so @-@ called . &quot;
a concentration of social weak in only a few districts should not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens count that there will be even movement in the discussion .
&quot; pres@@ idents Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must come to the boat . &quot;
&quot; indeed , I have concentrated on more buildings for family @-@ family buildings . &quot;
but what does not mean that not yet another compromise can be found .
&quot; Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness which is worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that teenage boys and child can no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens on screens , was taken over the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Po@@ k@@ emon Go , it is about to get people from the sofa and become more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games and finally limited to smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; naturally I refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were created on the characters , which were first created for the video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ern ( later , resulting from a drawing series , game cards and other spin@@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture decreased the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postp@@ oned by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go more users as Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players deal with their smartphones to outside and looking for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons who were tr@@ acked with a GPS and once they were found &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( about a screens@@ hot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation who played the game as she was still younger , closed to the w@@ ahn and sp@@ rang for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US the game led to a considerable rise in steps , which is the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ og@@ ram , an App for Apple Watch , which followed the Washington Post recently , that within two days following the launch of the game , the number of subsequent people , each day 30 minutes train , by 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for performance tuning .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to bring about &quot; &quot; 30 minutes of time &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look like . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces its chances to suffer from cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonder@@ full of Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people close the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always there are also jun@@ ctions , who must always complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what is it ?
it has been a breakthrough .
&quot; although Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ Bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and use the use of time .
&quot; however , due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games to join the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and to help many people on hunting are active , active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

on gan@@ zer line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ ad .
the 19 @-@ year American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the surplus title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ lamp of the Olympic Games .
&quot; its total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal and &quot; &quot; Final Five &quot; &quot; Mann@@ er@@ kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian bronze medals Ali@@ ya Mu@@ st@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the float @-@ bal@@ ancing of women in the art exhibition at the Olympic Summer in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth heter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Americans , which wins a multi @-@ round title and a total of the fifth , while it strength@@ ens its reputation , the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke out in tears than their final result was shown and her long journey was found at this moment an end .
&quot; this success , it presents them in the same League as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , which have brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ lion has dominated its sports art , 15 World Championship , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises , that &apos;s a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympi@@ ad of 1984 Mary Lou Res@@ on , that she said &quot; The Best Tur@@ ner@@ in is , which I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was expecting her last trial in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the ath@@ l@@ ete , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man embrace her , after they have won gold and silver in the single @-@ level of women at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first coin on Tuesday , while on the far@@ ewell party who was reti@@ ring in the retirement team coordinates in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a resting place . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , during their long way to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of its ground exercises - which include their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music which would fit at the road outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by Train@@ ers A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother , while a school cur@@ se was discovered , in the Bo@@ or@@ man was trained , became the strength . &quot;
&quot; she has no additional competition since the summer of 2013 , a vict@@ orious series that will keep as long as it does . &quot;
&quot; even if Mu@@ st@@ af@@ ina led to two turn@@ ings easily , dec@@ eased the image . &quot;
sul@@ king and bo@@ ots - in which Bil@@ es the World Series stops - lau@@ ted .
they took back with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the float again - and set up with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground even one of it .
&quot; R@@ ais@@ man im@@ pover@@ ished them sof@@ tly as they expected their end@@ g@@ ly - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow in Bil@@ es sh@@ iny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in their collection @-@ book , in reality . &quot;
&quot; the achievement of R@@ ais@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when they fought for the third place , but the bronze medals at a Ti@@ eb@@ r@@ ake in Mu@@ st@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year team of teams , called by the Americans &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , &quot; a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her soil exercise , she cast the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ ines , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which was sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;

police : 3 victims in Sus@@ m@@ ör@@ n@@ fall at the music hear in the car
&quot; according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl shot in one of the deadly attacks since a decade in the first serial number of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators made up eight shots from a handful of fire@@ arm , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is in the report read . &quot;
the police distributed with that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder not seem to be the result of a pre@@ dat@@ ory thing as the att@@ acker does not took the hand@@ bags or the $ 2.@@ 900 who took possession of one of the adult victims .
&quot; the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting broke the investig@@ ator , a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , predominantly in h@@ is@@ panic residen@@ ces were killed within four months in nine attacks for seven people and two more in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown n@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ern and a white Cadi@@ ll@@ ac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators refused to off@@ end the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked , and were committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot;
Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized due to their injury and died later . &quot;
&quot; Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on the spot . &quot;
a witness of the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was taken on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and turned out , that it was the work of the serial line . &quot;
&quot; investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and insured a bul@@ let from the seat , as well as ball frag@@ ments from the engine space . &quot;
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; as most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his anti@@ quity , Ed@@ mund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto did not know anything . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought , I managed this not . &quot;
I do not make this .
I don &apos;t let myself be missed .
&quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has taken care of it , &quot; she said . &quot;
your husband Vincent and her has been communicated that Ed@@ mund will never realize them under circumstances and that it may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they pre@@ sm@@ ote him institutional .
&quot; my first answer to that was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; stated Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a hearing .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit at his third year nor kr@@ ab@@ bles and he can still not speak .
but he slowly makes progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play with his two brothers and sing .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the sign @-@ language , which Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing me somewhat before &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language with , &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical character language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some character alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as Mas@@ ans or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect life of the C@@ avi@@ rus infected with the C@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto reminds of the emotional price of a im@@ certain future .
&quot; I asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I have been asked for a long time for a long time because I don &apos;t expect me to really tell me anyone .
&quot; however , Pic@@ ci@@ uto has caused a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth damage caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus . &quot;
it gets better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

the other two victims were not found in the car and the police are just under one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
Er@@ er@@ ler shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently it seems to have come to a Crus@@ fire between multiple guns .
&quot; Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault ri@@ ver@@ ters , who were trac@@ ed to various assault ri@@ dden , over@@ se@@ wn the Tat@@ ort . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a long @-@ lasting struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the wal@@ k@@ ward , we found sle@@ eves . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters here , who were very active involved , &quot; shared police officers Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles met in the area .
there came to be no fixed and the police currently checks reports according to the surveillance video .
&quot; on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl met with a cross @-@ old girl , when she played in front of her house in the residential neighborhood of the West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
they recovered and the police is still looking for a suspic@@ ious .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine among the women &apos;s oly@@ mp@@ i@@ am@@ ann@@ um in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is from more than one reason .
first of all I have been at every summer Olympics in 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
&quot; and secondly , this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspir@@ es many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Catholic , round , makes every proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has been the black and h@@ is@@ pan female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female Tur@@ ner@@ ei a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year there were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this is showing strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ag@@ ew@@ inner and the Americas .
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she was unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , heter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Americans , who won in an individual multi @-@ board event for women Gold . &quot;
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won the silver .
&quot; we do not experience the tip of this sport , but so the turn@@ around in the whole country is not . &quot;
Simone : Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all sm@@ ote all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to create it into the Olympic Team .
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; last five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ am@@ ann@@ ah will have only four gymn@@ ast in the crew . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that Tur@@ ns is a expensive sports and turbines primarily in private turn@@ around which are maintained by parents , which pay for training - interior , travel and hotel costs ( for coach and their turbines and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ outs are in af@@ flu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these verses the Tur@@ ner receive her whole training and that is a long @-@ term commitment to families .
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ er of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers from Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes , since they have started with the tower . &quot;
&quot; we have to get inspired to the congreg@@ ations of countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , provide a high @-@ quality and easier @-@ accessible turn@@ around . &quot;
I was founded my turn@@ foundation of 20 years .
&quot; at my upcoming events , we have offered free and affordable turbul@@ ence in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ pan ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the young high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics who earn the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport .
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and certainty for the spirit . &quot;
this combination provides life @-@ long advantages for health as well as for the academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to interest for the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real portr@@ ay@@ al of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic Mann@@ er@@ gol@@ ds and thanks , F@@ ass you motiv@@ ates so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance would like to organize a further strike after they have rejected Jerem@@ y H@@ unts proposal
&quot; the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes made by adop@@ ting a reform@@ ated contract with the function@@ ary of British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37.@@ 000 Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ebra , who voted in a choice , rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt had unvei@@ led the contract to introduce the contract and said that N@@ HS would be harmful in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients were harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ebra should receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve the care of ung@@ ast@@ al movements . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologen distributed last night in a communication with : &quot; Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists &quot; &quot; the proposed contract still has serious concerns , particularly that it is the current co@@ operating crisis and it is administ@@ ering to treat all doctors just . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks , who still will remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , must be made progress and the time runs . &quot;
efforts by the BM@@ A to solve the disputes through discussions with government on resistance and sometimes on o@@ de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened during a promise , the Jerem@@ y Hunt had made it last month later that his door would always be revealed . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt must act now , lift up the penetration and speak the concerns of the assistance specialists . &quot;
&quot; if he should not do this , so it did the Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ebra clearly that they are ready to carry out more work measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike in late April saw a surge of nearly 13.@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as n@@ urses and specialists were included to provide doctors on the strip chain . &quot;
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the reform@@ ated contract with the function@@ alities of British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better Wo@@ ch@@ end@@ ental wage for the 54.@@ 000 Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ebra , which will be subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , called for Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working @-@ actions do nothing of the only little , strain but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing homes and their families just worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; over the past two months , we talked to the Com@@ mem@@ ee of the Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists and responded positively to the health Department of Health and other minist@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; the employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as discharge , flexibility in training , training courses , training courses , training and the gender @-@ specific wage counter@@ f@@ eit in medicine - a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning the compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per diary - can reduce heart attack
thousands of heart @-@ patient patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication that was recommended by the authorities to accom@@ o@@ date this more people for a longer period of time .
the ger@@ mination medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for people with a her@@ edit@@ ary disease .
the drug is administ@@ ered for 12 months after a heart attack which reduces the risk of a stroke if or another heart attack is reduced .
the regulatory authorities nice of the N@@ HS has recommended a four years long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authorities nice of the N@@ HS has recommended a four years long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; about 140,000 people each year suffer a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack , or stroke . &quot;
&quot; heart attack and stroke are caused by accumul@@ ations of fatty material in the arter@@ ies , which form the amounts . &quot;
&quot; if the Bel@@ ag falls apart , it may cause a blood cl@@ ot that causes blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood th@@ inner breaks out , it may flow through the blood stream , and flow from blood flow towards the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , made by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the brand name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk , making it un@@ likely the formation of blood cl@@ auses . &quot;
&quot; the executive &apos;s throw from nice , which today was released , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the nice Ministry of Health Organization , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack or a stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience indicates that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively with the reduction of further en@@ act@@ less and impact on people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend the treatment options for thousands of people , which can benefit from it . &quot;
the information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the conduc@@ tivity is recommended no treatment that goes beyond this time period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness is flour@@ ishing in Muslim regions
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was removed last year on the dismis@@ sal of a government report due to corruption from the ministry .
&quot; a culture of Political Cor@@ respon@@ ness has led to that widespread electoral was ign@@ ited in Muslim communities , as a crus@@ hing government report today . &quot;
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es acc@@ esses the police , electoral and Rath@@ houses for this to have ignored the evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to ethnic and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and local government , who is now an antagon@@ ism , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that it should be permitted to set the police , to protect un@@ locking voters outside of choice . &quot;
he recommends that voters should have a credit card with them to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a voters must merely call its name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes to bear even remot@@ ely ink on the fingers of a person , if they give their vote to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers should maintain more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
it demands that the press should have more access to the simil@@ arities and decisions of non @-@ official committees or work@@ groups .
&quot; this not only serves against election , but is also intended to protect the municipal government in front of the broad@@ casting and financial fraud culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets electoral sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special tri@@ bunal decided that the am@@ acting mayor l@@ oud@@ speakers should be de@@ ported to a L@@ itan@@ ei on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court was that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ished the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal manner , and that he would have brought his critics with r@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man is supposed to have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ig@@ ous duty of Muslims , to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation , where one person chosen as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric told that there would be evidence of the whole land of fraud .
he vo@@ iced in particular alar@@ ming for fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent brief@@ ing - in the older members of Muslim community pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to compens@@ ate for the electoral system , including the leaders to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; proof that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exer@@ ted , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elder , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ical or ban@@ ish background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... State institutions have such a behavior due to &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to ethnic and religion should be ignored . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke to 50 recommendations to shr@@ ubs the system , including pro@@ hibition that political activ@@ ist stamp will be able to deal with &quot; &quot; election &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires also tough@@ er registration over@@ insp@@ ections to prevent the electoral directory to immigration and social fraud purposes . &quot;
consider voters to ask voters before the choice after your credit card .
&quot; not remo@@ vable Tin@@ te on the finger of a person , once they made their voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
systematic check@@ ups on the nationality of a person carry out to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit on applications for automatic brief@@ ing .
pro@@ hibition that political activists process full stamp and det@@ ectors from stamp @-@ elections .
the police give the powers to set up claims for election @-@ stations .
&quot; a legislative change , which facilit@@ ates an indic@@ t@@ ment due to inti@@ mid@@ ation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Social Act 1983 ) . &quot;
photographer offered in multi @-@ gy@@ ms .
requirement that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( excluding Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees are usually able to enforce that voters go alone in the election . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case have no pen@@ al code . &quot;
&quot; the election Court has l@@ oud@@ speakers to Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for a L@@ itan@@ ei on corrupt and illegal practices as unt@@ apped , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons for hin@@ dering - according to the high demands in the criminal proceedings - guilty . &quot;
he also cri@@ tici@@ ze the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ controls &quot; of the constitu@@ encies of the Rath@@ houses .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court part in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a War@@ n@@ signal .
&quot; our country bears as the mother of the parli@@ aments a proud heritage , but the worrying and spread spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ predec@@ essors and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ ers in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are this week about the French Rad@@ sport Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot out of edge and band that proved to be an impressive dual predecessor in the heart of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one in order to destroy gold , who has its own famous double @-@ go@@ ers - at least not , if you can trust the social media faith . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which currently fli@@ mm@@ ed at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ oni@@ ken , which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Holl@@ y@@ ur@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunters and the wolf : team member of the US team in Archery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates double @-@ predecessor in the Rad@@ ren@@ n@@ bahn , many people on the Internet have been pointed out how to be a certain ar@@ cher of the Z@@ ans from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in Archery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter , after pictures , on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star no secre@@ tly . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the mad@@ ness in the social media and gave to that he has been listening to his childhood since his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see big simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , distributed Br@@ ady the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I do this as compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 this year is undoubtedly closer to the center : the open simil@@ arity between the British for@@ spr@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Mu@@ st@@ af@@ ina , with its large , expres@@ sive eye should be able to go through the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
a walk higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Coaching is
another decent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian silver medals in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the son@@ at@@ ted skin and bl@@ on@@ den hair@@ s such as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d on , while the American Nathan has attacked Adrian by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ penter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot;
not the one : a Twitter user was very happy that others have the simil@@ arities too .
theory into space : according to this user there is a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple perhaps a reason
&quot; a Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in explained their satisfaction , that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ penter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ penter has an incredibly similar facial form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ Jenn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the von actress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medals in Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which resem@@ bles its own beautiful , wide smile , which resem@@ bles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ trag@@ ed about women who tried in the middle of business sh@@ am@@ eless under@@ wear
&quot; the buyers did not know where they should go to , when a woman moved their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to sample sub@@ p@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she turned out how she saw it , she went out and laid them back into the shelf . &quot;
she moved across and tasted four pairs of shelter in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place mall in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark Business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place mall in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tasted the under@@ p@@ ants before she put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , Jenn@@ y Davi@@ dson , who had tried at the same time in business , told that after the mysterious woman had tried to under@@ wear it again and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the shop , they took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants out of the cli@@ p@@ board , attracted their own str@@ aps and p@@ ants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a bit dis@@ crete place to do it - it was just there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; each star@@ ing , when she returned the sub@@ t@@ ants , which you obviously not have fallen when they put them into the shelf . &quot;
she reiter@@ ated the same with three other sub@@ mer@@ ging before she decided that ye didn &apos;t fell apart and went out again .
she seemed to not distur@@ b that she was watching someone - or about the person who would like to buy the under@@ p@@ ants that had tried them .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lived in K@@ ent , said , &quot; How do conf@@ ess to think that someone would take a different person who had a different person , and that were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday morning .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I got , the staff is trying to pull the clothing pieces from the sale after she went - what is just as good . &quot;

how to protect with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before arms
&quot; the world out there is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make him a little safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ ker in New York to find out how to move with armed rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you look forward to you from the front or in the back , this video will show you how you turn to your pre@@ dator . &quot;
&quot; if one fell to you from the rear , then you should turn out as a First &#93; so that you can see your att@@ acker and move from the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bows on the face .
&quot; then hit him with the knee into the bar , and turn off , while the att@@ acker l@@ ends off pain , the weapon from his hands . hit him with the run and move back , while they set the weapon to him . &quot;
&quot; in case of att@@ ackers that approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the nut line , grab the weapon and rot@@ ate them , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; while at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the gun out of its handle before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon to him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it &apos;s Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that it is in a smo@@ b on the safest , your money is too rich - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;

a British attack moved his immune system and spice refl@@ ex of a serious testing - by doing some of the narro@@ wn@@ ess and ek@@ el@@ est places of Europe .
&quot; moder@@ ator and travel gate Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k dots his course on the Pic@@ c@@ adi@@ l@@ ly Circus , a dishwasher , a tractor toil@@ ette and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the res@@ ili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; in front of the check of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what it will be introduced . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment made under the title &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results to day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ b of a tractor , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely ab@@ rupt , but actually there are in a kitchen rin@@ se more poor bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical specialists about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he wo@@ ke up , more than a bad night &apos;s taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right was known to test the res@@ ili@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by travelled through the world , and ate himself as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations to sin@@ ks of toilets , the task put his immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; he told me : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and s@@ amm@@ ew@@ ater . &quot;
in the film he was justified his reputation in any case .
&quot; the One of what it had , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
its pro@@ found@@ ries showed a L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ m of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ ms are fresh@@ ly fresh and less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to det@@ ach after their L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ m over 4000 units was , while fresh@@ ly paid hands a lot less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different locations such as the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This comes the worst , which I have in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will not complain about there because it is here inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company features Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o tubes that includes both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ ach@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and simultaneously explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we carried crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings caused by that we said &quot; L@@ ass to call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who introduced the director of the film , added : &quot; &quot; let me have lost me so - I could have lost my respect for Ian when he had caught some of the things that I have reli@@ eved to listen to him , just like the ek@@ el@@ ous Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things where it was easier to bring Ian Gillan and others where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we have taken some of these dirty goodies to film .
&quot; in one of the survey conducted by 2015 , 84 per cent of all surv@@ ey@@ ed lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 per cent told that they at least sometimes use products that included lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destroyed prior to Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ds social , in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ zi@@ ale family left their social home after a delay with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because they had terr@@ orized their neighbours . &quot;
T@@ anya Skelet@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash Corn@@ wall .
&quot; after they were far away from their estate , they found the property set up the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls made cl@@ aff@@ able holes on , wooden sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ s were cultivated , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor , and gr@@ aff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family were converted and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy who works for the household administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that they feared that the apartment is no longer able to fix . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare and I believe that people do not have to live in this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , as this estate probably will be considered as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls . &quot;
the family is mountainous and their reputation is also available .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the meantime in the meantime and the police spoke that the terror that had added the family , street struggles with Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ers , in@@ timi@@ d by residents , drug abuse , drug , and excessive writing , streams and cur@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was standing on the lease , got a series of anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house that will be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found &quot;
they were tr@@ aded in the property where drugs were tr@@ aded in the past .
neighbours said they had to fight them on the streets and regularly needed the police
Corn@@ wall Housing Ar@@ del@@ o@@ gi@@ o@@ aded her and her partner this week by the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to make voluntary .
the delay were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors that said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They sho@@ cked by anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are incredible . &quot;
&quot; today tomorrow we were not able to sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that we are not used !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Neigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that the family had to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ thrown side of the municipal house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys have been thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it administ@@ ered by the ten@@ ants to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family , as a delay always is the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing is taking into consideration . &quot;
&quot; it was a very difficult case , as the behavior was extremely difficult and their works had to be seen for their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the municipality , who have to come to us and have provided us the information provided . &quot;
I hope that this development will con@@ sol@@ ation some neighbours and the message conv@@ eys that anti @-@ social behavior will not be toler@@ ated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but that they are all about 20 . &quot;
&quot; a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ds on the ground . &quot;
workers of the household administration will now have to have gar@@ bage bl@@ at@@ ly who surround the house
&quot; 2014 the police led a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis , as well as sc@@ ales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ y and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don has received a money sentence after they had been found guilty of the possession of a drug of the class B in trading vision .
&quot; they asser@@ ted that money came for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came to life in an automobile accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without ob@@ d@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner live now in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many rooms of the house were rewarded with gr@@ aff@@ iti .
the police says that they will do ten@@ ants who will not hold on the order
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared with that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ds are a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that will not hold on the order .
&quot; this goes to those who think they cannot accept themselves without self @-@ care , as well as those who have come from such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour which continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities .

&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new game season , there is a doubt about the fitness state of the team , which was held on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;

Donald Tru@@ mp spatial @-@ enormous problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. republi@@ cans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , also in traditionally conservative federal states to include their majority . &quot;
presidential did@@ did@@ at Donald Tru@@ mp now gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ pointed and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire as something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can warehouse from the race , now the doubts about his success in the struggle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp before evangel@@ ic Christians , which he asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; to blame , false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took up his well @-@ known media . &quot;
Republi@@ can sky@@ rock@@ wall
Utah is usually a safe bank for the republi@@ cans .
&quot; a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June , according to Tru@@ mp and his assistant of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , equ@@ als . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by the distance that are usual for Republi@@ can candidates in the state of state . &quot;
as endangered also Arizona and Georgia .
&quot; in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC answered Tru@@ mp on the question , as he would like to stop on the rise of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I have done it so far . &quot;
&quot; and sh@@ out : this will be &apos; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he is doing nothing else than to tell the truth .
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end of the political correctness , whether in order , Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
then I returned to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to Press@@ views , the Party of Tru@@ mp is supposed to be lo@@ wered the Party to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present a better balance sheet . &quot;
instead of this one wants to take the candidates of Republi@@ cans for the Congress stronger among the arms .

with it a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic lad@@ der Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a teen@@ ager .
&quot; in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ feld Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ ten Gust@@ avo Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med . &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their temp@@ o and her melody .
it is a wonderful mix to be the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music really in our blood !
&quot; in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays a older p@@ aired Maria . &quot;
she re@@ members with melanchol@@ y to her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there was Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is clever , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , which I have as a tube , &quot; lau@@ ghing Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of Lob@@ es for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous person .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
rigi@@ d is for him a necessity .
&quot; you see it in each of its movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is at all very important ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip World Cup . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we left the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants wanted them not . &quot;
&quot; these are the same themes , and they are just as much more meaningful as at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
&quot; London artist , who joined the IS in Syria , was killed in Syria . &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British pupils who settled in London in order to join the IS in order to join in Syria , according to reports according to Syria . &quot;

&quot; Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died shortly after her family according to her family , after she had to leave the war of war and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good in it lies - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks to go into a war area - people stop taking this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;

the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .

Turkey : Kur@@ dish community counts with mass c@@ urs@@ ed
&quot; those who didn &apos;t fit and Erdo@@ gan , sitting on frozen caffeine , &quot; says the presidency of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation dialogue and the world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short term , the Kur@@ dish Municip@@ ality of Germany are counting on the short term with tens of thousands of people looking for Germany from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , there could even be &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; believes the representative Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; because of the hard approach of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the put@@ sch@@ ism , the Kur@@ dish municipality of Germany expects a mass c@@ urs@@ ed to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in short notice , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , medium @-@ term , with some hundreds of thousands of bonuses from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime fights the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government already moved to Kur@@ dish floods with imp@@ unity , be 500,000 Kurds within Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the wel@@ ded coup are still sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ er ethnic Turks .
many are going to begin to start in Europe if they are further suppres@@ sed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that takes itself refugees , in their own land refugees , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the association was accused of the targeted settlement of sy@@ r@@ atic Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
so that Erdo@@ gan helps to raise the output pressure on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradi@@ cated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the association spoke that the German government positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan , and its followers . &quot;
also in Germany there is a &quot; Hex@@ e@@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the man@@ len @-@ movement feared also the escape of many Turks .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , mainly Kurds and op@@ positioning . &quot;

&quot; as the newspaper reported under calling on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Finance , the Turks adopted the largest group of responsible for political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; on the point of June 30 , this is 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all as asylum @-@ recognised ( 39.@@ 625 ) . &quot;
&quot; this survey will not be found before war , poverty or in@@ tiv@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; asylum seek@@ ers according to the basic law are exclusively political , therefore , by state @-@ state @-@ based side , individually followed . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : to go there where it w@@ ess
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer @-@ election campaign and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia must not choose the country &apos;s country .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; 2021 will not be held right at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
for blocks of the so far it does not go : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ sw@@ ing@@ ling - that comes together . &quot;
the locals that are convinced by the electoral fighters are on vacation .
&quot; most holi@@ day@@ makers , who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not a native people , must not choose the country . &quot;
&quot; to do this , practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters will spread , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and in the end votes count , only mills . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of F@@ eri@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again give up a campaign for almost all the people over the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be feared for his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , now lies in surveys clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; exciting , how strong new@@ com@@ ers will cut Af@@ ro@@ ds and what remains at the end of the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ du@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous electoral campaign , one can see from his grandfather . &quot;
&quot; he travels through land , distributed ro@@ ses and chat a little with the people , as it was already his legendary wor@@ t@@ kar@@ ger predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and there is ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the blame for the flo@@ wering of the African . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; have acceler@@ ates the rise of justice and what it probably will cost the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its peak performance , the interior minister Lor@@ enz Caf@@ fier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place of election . &quot;
she has invited twice ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel and invited me to Merkel ( Chancellor Angela Merkel and Merkel ) is located in the Nor@@ the@@ ast .
&quot; but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Meckl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it also p@@ ity to listen to someone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel to listen . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the Nord@@ ost CD@@ U is largely disp@@ ens@@ ed on the usual electoral forces on market positions and especially shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , how co@@ ert , play only a &quot; lower role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also has ground@@ ed that you are on the land the base cur@@ b , that it has to be very str@@ ingent to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the times of the country hardly present . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U electoral comb@@ us@@ ement Kok@@ ert to his fellow fighters , however , is also self @-@ extingu@@ ishing : &quot; &quot; you have to go there where there is w@@ eh@@ est , namely , where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden weddings , each birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot on the game stands , Sell@@ ering its SPD now called to a particularly dedicated election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; during the election of 2011 , the SPD had clearly won with 35,@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , petty @-@ party with seven percent in the surveys , are thir@@ st the jump into the landing day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue of the holidays @-@ need a modern virtue and exp@@ ose her election campaign in the internet .
&quot; online campaign , &quot; &quot; it is called the President Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green constitu@@ ent fighters went to a sp@@ ur@@ red search for native stimulation among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the peak kan@@ did@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at by the Moravian lakes and finds it still beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; election &quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment .
B@@ 27 @-@ San@@ zation : speakers are suffering from blocking
&quot; at the speed , with which the B 27 is gentle , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the developers of the buil@@ ders , start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only at 8 pm , there is always praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything pretty delicate , &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff by the Jet @-@ gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no inter@@ suit .
&quot; the construction site could be moved at weekends to the half @-@ time planning to the south , until the end of October will be everything ready . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed shall also be the case for the construction work , about when it comes to the establishment of containers . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to south , the lock of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the traffic situation has been relaxed within the place . &quot;
the citizens can now drive back to O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
the distinction between the place seems to go back .
&quot; there was partly considerable discomfort , &quot; says the responsible management of the refurb@@ ishment management of the executive director Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bachelor &apos;s road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , A@@ vel@@ i@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sheep were examined and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led out that man@@ holes are mixed up in residential areas .
&quot; as well the speed of speed are not observed , the community also called for measuring tools from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there was considerable transitions , &quot; says King , who took place themselves on the situation themselves . &quot;
two to three per minute have been stopped .
the quick@@ est was at the pace @-@ 30 kilometers at the pace of the pace .
&quot; since the job@@ site has been continued , but it has become more quiet . &quot;
&quot; for busin@@ ess@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the road again is open again . &quot;
busin@@ ess@@ men are not happy to have a look at the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ san@@ itation has led to sales in them , lets everyone who ask you . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , for which the refurb@@ ishment has little consequences . &quot;
&quot; even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; most light decline , &quot; but also a that of course &quot; the cat@@ tery is lacking . &quot;
&quot; at the strongest , the Loc@@ ated along the road . &quot;
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the teachers have made it hard . &quot;
&quot; it was missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ sel@@ eil . &quot;
we have to be pleased over every Euro turnover .
&quot; the revenue is paid to &quot; &quot; far over 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the road building took its operation &quot; &quot; for two years back . &quot;
half of his staff have to be released .
&quot; if I have had a company with 4000 employees , and half would have been dismis@@ sed , the policy would have changed differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner could give it a financial balance , giving notice the hospitality , otherwise from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now , they also cuts the dis@@ advantages that surrender to the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties , where such a little pra@@ ises was managed . &quot;
&quot; with all pl@@ agues , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his guest house will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family run is already located since 17@@ 15 here , he refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars are now visible because of the complicated road management less frequently , it can understand . &quot;
if you do not go down it is also very different .
&quot; that his tri@@ bal kli@@ fts are back again after the end of refurb@@ ishment , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with B@@ SE and bird gri@@ ps , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the impact of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the greatest crisis , which has experienced its hospitality in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; constantly , in the name of the terrorist fight against laws . &quot;
after the recent attacks the Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now a th@@ icker security package .
but what has a d@@ ul@@ sive status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the reconciliation of reconciliation .
&quot; all his proposals be the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ists &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new safety package . &quot;
they do not ask anyone .
&quot; others , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
even if I feel it too .
&quot; but as interior minister , however , it was located to results and at a &quot; &quot; re@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , Ma@@ ł@@ ère will be a little time in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , before he presents his conclusions for the security of the Republic . &quot;
but the fall for this is all the more extensive .
&quot; some is already known , announced that a new security authority is to take care of the l@@ oud@@ ant communication , is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany must implement multiple EU guidelines on air passenger data and arms .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for safety bodies is also not surprising .
&quot; partly to start de Ma@@ izi@@ ère a second run for proposals which had not been to do with the SPD : he wants to put a symptom of terrorist groups under punishment , and jiha@@ dists with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; they will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U man &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he still consider it to be reasonable and demanding nothing , which in the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ alist does not have any chances . &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they have partly in itself : he plans to deport@@ ations for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ention of people from deport@@ ation .
&quot; refugees , which are specifically fet@@ ched into the country , before their smartphones can leave and social media accounts for a security examination . &quot;
&quot; at D@@ ul@@ ties for distr@@ acted asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - about such , the crimes commit or their papers are aware of their identity . &quot;
some of them is political and legally hei@@ ghtened .
man@@ ches can also be un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
&quot; and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of thought , for example - is the question : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it is not possible to address the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people were worried about the high refugee concerns about security . &quot;
&quot; and things which the people were deeply engaged , but they were not lost in the election of the election . &quot;
the inner security is enormous into the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the contam@@ ination is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral campaigns . &quot;
the European Union and the SPD will therefore take part in mind for internal security .
in the past few days it went high between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ sti@@ ger dispute over the equipment of the federal police , then over a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ interior ministers , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ es also call a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also here about vers@@ ed sounds .
&quot; from a return of a double @-@ pass , he kept nothing . &quot;
we have liked the discussion in Germany .
&quot; new to make , be not useful . &quot;
and at a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own package is constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ists , has to be revealed only . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of things to worry about , which could provide dispute . &quot;
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to establish itself in the subject of inner security . &quot;
&quot; eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes only times careful talk and says , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security . &quot;
&quot; still , Volkswagen is still coming from . &quot;
&quot; despite diesel @-@ sk@@ and@@ als , the output will rise around the world . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs all .
at the recall campaign there is ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e around a term .
Volkswagen starts with the disp@@ atch in the second half @-@ year .
&quot; Europe &apos;s biggest motor@@ bike can continue in the past year , despite the diesel ar@@ ming , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ moving markets continue to set up a plus . &quot;
&quot; but in July the core @-@ brand VW especially in Western Europe , in July , the core @-@ brand VW especially in Western Europe and is hard to res@@ ett@@ led the overall sale of how the enterprises included in the D@@ ax companies . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the brand VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent lower cars than in the prior @-@ year months . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , to China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year months . &quot;
in the home of Germany the extinction around almost a six .
hall@@ mark Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann conducted the we@@ aker numbers from July mainly on two selling days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , it was given in some core markets due to &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um pushed to the resign@@ ation from the EU , explained a talk . &quot;
&quot; in the U.S. , where the car@@ bure@@ tors first escal@@ ated , is also further a minus . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the mainly affected Hau@@ ke of the Lower Saxony is still ongoing , due to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months is merely a supplier of 0.05 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech . &quot;
consolidated b@@ ef Fred Kap@@ pler was able to continue selling a sales department from January to July .
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen to this period , around the world 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software subscription .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW about 2.5 million cars calls for conversion into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of conversion , VW , that the re@@ modeling of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after changing the vehicles , there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or performance . &quot;
&quot; the high@@ lighting point the client after the conversion a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I speak not of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
reasons are legal enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; focus &quot; &quot; had reports , Volkswagen ge@@ aring up his German customers now a guarantee for measuring diesel models . &quot;
this had confirmed this last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Commerce .
&quot; by the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; VW has the support of my investigation Commission and the KBA is full . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after the conversion , no deterior@@ ations are taking place and all types of relevant vehicles remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; in the wide term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; Volkswagen the possibility that customers can upgrade for example a half year after the upgrade into a workshop - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; even in the customer &apos;s interest it is important to avoid any other damage caused by any other damage , which does not have anything to do with the sc@@ andal on any warranty conditions , as it was meant . &quot;
&quot; therefore , do not use the term &quot; warranty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich austerity - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; Bank Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 clients who park 40 million euros on tox@@ ins or day@@ time accounts . &quot;
&quot; the German Federal Association of German banks speak of an individual case , and does not see a signal . &quot; &quot; normal austerity &quot; would not have to be afraid of paying for their spar@@ gro@@ ms pen@@ al code . &quot;
&quot; bearing banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay 0.6 percent pen@@ al code . &quot;
&quot; this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits on 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day@@ time accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 cost increases to 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he has been raised 40 million euros by one day , which could not be taken from one day to another , and which he could not be analysed . &quot;
&quot; the lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.6 percent of costs , &quot; said the bank account . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lie down for every million 4,000 Euro . &quot;
the cost will be on the basis of the inter@@ c@@ ach@@ ment principle .
&quot; the cash simply leave the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I already experienced four transitions , I am not even the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ quet . &quot;
most customers have their understanding and changes to other assets .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the co @-@ oper@@ atives of Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to wear alone , be &quot; &quot; economically permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for con@@ duction , credit cards or re@@ mitt@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; with criminal attor@@ neys for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ ingi@@ an People - and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their skat@@ bank stores 2014 are made head@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , captain of the banking association , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private customers have to pay for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks are much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cliff , which is equipped with a wealth of wealth . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , if they charge free money . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 established a cooperative bank G@@ mund has two @-@ places in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region , known actor , spor@@ tsmen and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; the Gen@@ ital association Bayern &quot; currently no further banks are known , who charge a warehouse for deposits of private customers , &quot; said Spe@@ aker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the German People &apos;s Association and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ banks ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared late June : &quot; the threshold , into neg@@ atives towards private clients , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition was hard , and it dro@@ wned the migration from investors to the competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not have fallen in the width .
destination plates : who does actually buy sound @-@ plates ?
lonely men middle age love plates .
&quot; before you write to the commentary box to over@@ lap him under the alias of non @-@ ag@@ le@@ em@@ ony men &apos;s age , with r@@ ust ins@@ ults , this statement leads from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , it is not a boom of record , not at a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that would like to greet the rest@@ iness of physical objects , but due to Mid@@ life no@@ stalgia . &quot;
those who recently purchased a record are all pre@@ diction after age 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyers . &quot;
&quot; it is also no horror by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older records , retain their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it , alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) . &quot;
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow the camera while in the midst of a business street in Soho , a hum@@ ble grey attack and wild si@@ lic@@ ers before I ste@@ al , my hands hold and something decisive as : &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let us take a look at that . &quot;
&quot; even though the heart of So@@ hos is slowly introduced to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now complete the buildings where independent seller were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman , to turn the camera to the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I followed by S@@ ister Ray ( databases : eight men &apos;s middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I already appreciate &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; this record , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not responded to him at home ) , dress the walls of his room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of his available income : it is now able to buy records which he could not afford , when they appeared and once again to buy items that he sold , when he was young and pl@@ ague . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late six@@ ties , early 70@@ s , which appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things , where I was probably some young to buy them , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend alone time , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I tr@@ un@@ ke not very much . &quot;
this is my L@@ aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers who meet , which he meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people that are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and to see again to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; of the conversations I have led , people usually have taken care of 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their plates , to buy CDs now sell their CDs to get back up their records , &quot; says he . &quot;
this would explain the boom of tr@@ ailers of a certain age .
but what about the con@@ ical emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to recognize that record stores a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world , and want to withdraw to the stability of trusted sound @-@ drives , from objects , the happy ju@@ gen@@ der@@ inn@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it may be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is true with me as a collector and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to get spirit@@ ually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; a staff of a record stack . &quot;
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people , the last month have bought a record , they have not heard yet . &quot;
&quot; the survey found also found that 41 % possess a turn@@ table which they never use , while 7 % of those who have one record , have no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of news report , I would probably look very worried , while in a p@@ ile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( databases : three men &apos;s middle age ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone recently came here pure and said , &quot; I don &apos;t miss any record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; this is not a large percentage , but it is definitely happening . &quot;
&quot; more produ@@ kt@@ las@@ tic , less musi@@ kl@@ as@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , which are only slow . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which is dedicated to the record of almost a whole floor , has an underground audience , when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women middle aged . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the most popular shops - Wild Be@@ asts of syn@@ thesi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ ary pop instead of experimental Jazz dr@@ yers from the l@@ oud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks son@@ ically lonely , but nag@@ ging psychological trau@@ mas are difficult to determine if you stand in addition to someone 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes in the shop and regards the variation of the related plates . &quot;
it rather makes a window t@@ ame as a big one .
&quot; it does not deserve much , so the collectors of plates is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from one computer or another way but the beauty of plates is ... it drives with a lov@@ able si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
&quot; my last stop is a shop , from which is said that a new generation of record owners should have inspired : urban outlet . &quot;
&quot; while I give the note that Je@@ ans @-@ hot@@ p@@ ants have to be cour@@ ier , watching a group of young teenagers that group@@ ed for a moment to buy Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter superior to buy a cro@@ sl@@ ey record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a stair@@ well , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Bu@@ ckl@@ ey , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , essential plates for average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody looks at her - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to engage them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record @-@ art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items might mean more money for the sector , and some customers might send into the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; it is not a surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one that is most for lux@@ uries such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research surveys found that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , let them , at least in turn@@ tables in Soho , the large number of female collectors and record @-@ lovers , which exist in reality , plate and in Onlin@@ e@@ for@@ en , un@@ considered . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the stroll through the plate of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while the rigi@@ d look of an un@@ fur@@ tive , 30 @-@ year old moder@@ ator ste@@ er that over the shoulders nothing left middle age . &quot;

French courts withdraw from shops in the jungle refugee camps .
&quot; a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , do@@ zens of Proven@@ cal shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees living , down @-@ down . &quot;
&quot; during a trial proceedings this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be fu@@ elled to sell 72 pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical shops , sell hair@@ style services or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places should be crus@@ hed because they would be a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid , and which a fire and san@@ itation risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals that are offered by the nation@@ ally supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also carried out that the provisional business and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in Lille decided that there is no legal basis for the instruction of people who operate the 72 provisional business , but spatial that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais will be absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than people who live &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas have quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the precip@@ itation was the young book kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as a consultation on Asyl@@ um for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in stock . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that closing &quot; for these children of a catastrophe would be of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany Ras@@ er must set up for the next generation speed of speed : in various federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the Temp@@ os@@ ende are particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic acting En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at random points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement through the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway building or to sandy bridges with temporary Tem@@ pol@@ ishes , there are often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary bl@@ ater to ensure compliance with the speed of speed . &quot;
a lasting mobile design can however be too dangerous or consuming .
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is aut@@ op@@ ark : his battery holds five days , the case data is encrypted via a mo@@ dem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles over several tracks can also be recorded at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed , as well as the access message by time , chassis and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the high @-@ off state , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with a bar . &quot;
&quot; so that he is not easy to store , he is run in the trade @-@ run , so that the wheels also disappear in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also sh@@ attered safe outside . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ ater from destruction . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various Länder , and now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also bl@@ ends foreign authorities with the new technology : recently , France has posted 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
&quot; UK wins silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold takes . &quot;
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ he Ru@@ g@@ by arrived in the finale on Thursday evening for a rup@@ ting stop in the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ arth stage here in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji divided a masterpiece of class in handling , Side @-@ St@@ epp@@ ing , rep@@ air@@ flow , and ro@@ her strength to win Gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ ed@@ ist of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was reconc@@ iled by the not too bad Tro@@ st@@ preis of the silver medal - Great Britain fourth to this day - and they could certainly be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they sm@@ ote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the distinct defeat of the boom , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could be returned to them in the finale . &quot;
but irrespective of that Fi@@ ji would have be@@ aten the form of a 15 @-@ man team in order .
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation - but it probably will not be - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal in order to hang his neck , Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben Ryan , the former manager of England from Wim@@ bl@@ edon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind it .
eight years ago she lost at Ryan every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this fl@@ ap is awake , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and did the attacks GB@@ s out of fun de@@ clin@@ ing .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. , when one would run into driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with even four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai added another attack from the right corner that he walked . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely made the ball .
&quot; a h@@ unk T@@ ackle T@@ ackle T@@ ackle Mitchell stops the mountain from Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third gate , but it has Fi@@ ji only stopped . &quot;
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re @-@ beginning and there was still a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed by other weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to rest .
&quot; it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while the UK is still growing . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time by and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the relations of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua ran after a brilliant stop@@ play by Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was going for long in favor of South Tyrol , whose fans s@@ angen and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ ches . &quot;
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ icing with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the fi@@ ff pastry , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and we@@ pu@@ te crus@@ hed in the la@@ wns . &quot;
earlier in the days Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain in South Africa in a scar@@ ce half @-@ match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ k in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton opened the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate among the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant delay of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , insured the prize - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the struggle with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ al@@ eres gold than those games and that wants what hot .
&quot; from the first set@@ back to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve that enter into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though it was only the examples that were at the ruin , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was always present as they called for the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in two @-@ wheel@@ er without tax @-@ woman in a row , the first women in the history of the British sport that put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; your domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all their very stur@@ dy use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , refl@@ ecting on the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not reflected the type of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the herd , there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to wild hel@@ pers that make the difference and there was no one more des@@ ist than the coach , which would not survive 30 months ago when he was diagnosed this day at all . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he is ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had blas@@ ph@@ al , the op@@ eri@@ as@@ able , and that did it . &quot;
if you do not do that spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather f@@ lim@@ b situation .
it changes a bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could be at the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , could begin what the inter@@ ruption held to a minimum if it is at all the right term in such circumstances . &quot;
I needed money so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would lie . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; a challenge is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the uncertainty of the victory , their first thoughts of Williams went their first thoughts to Williams who spent a ner@@ ven@@ ding morning to talk more than anything else and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional Wr@@ ack . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated only , how much I mean that , how much I and hel@@ mets , and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one ; therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I would have no better person for train@@ able or would like to wish for a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had begun to close , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let itself rip .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make a little rab@@ ies .
&quot; today we did not want fire@@ works , we just wanted to achieve a good result and win the race what we did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future will meet .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this would have a lot of pressure .
&quot; in London it took around six months to grasp , that I am an Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
it was all as new for me and I was so soci@@ able .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years pre @-@ exempl@@ ary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the Aqu@@ arian association , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert Gö@@ ller , goes into retirement . &quot;
&quot; the Association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bav@@ arian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small fr@@ aming drinking water @-@ functional association as a model for the great water producers .
this was the name of some time ago in the origin@@ alt@@ on in a post of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
little later the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken were the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ group gel@@ te &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , the 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband Staff was 28 years as managing director . &quot;
at the age of 65 he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose Association of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , Municip@@ al Mountains , promotes about 150@@ 000 cu@@ bic water and provides 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants every year . &quot;
&quot; member states are the churches Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Broadband , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Baun@@ ach . &quot;
for more towns and villages there are water supply contracts .
&quot; the current chair , l@@ ati@@ tude in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller 1985 as a ground@@ sk@@ e@@ eper was set and already been appointed as Managing Director of the Pur@@ pose Society . &quot;
&quot; his tasks are very diverse and they extend from the water conduc@@ tivity and repair work on office and organizational skills , the budget creation , calcul@@ ating fees and contributions to emergency , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events they called the start @-@ up and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the high container ( 1999 ) , the re@@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the bat@@ ter of water instructions . &quot;
there have been no stagn@@ ation and you have always recorded new innovations because water life be@@ ats and pot@@ able water is the most important food .
&quot; in their Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has worked with a lot of heart@@ land for his water @-@ purpose association , and he has lived in law for the water@@ purpose , as if it would be his own company . &quot;
a few weeks ago he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ group to the nit@@ rate before the water forum of the district of Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
he has received very much praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller in the part pra@@ y@@ ants Alf@@ ons g@@ rie@@ bel , who worked for 28 years with him . &quot;
he is the best water@@ front and he was a loyal co @-@ cap .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as the highlights from his point of view , he described the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re @-@ structured of the twelve @-@ verb@@ s . &quot;
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe in the high @-@ container at Kirch@@ lau@@ ter on a 3rd January . &quot;
&quot; here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night will work , so that the villages of water could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn , one can only maintain even because you filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt . &quot;
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who enters the succession of Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller .

&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , after him will be publi@@ cis@@ ed openly . &quot;

meanwhile the police have released a photo of him .

meanwhile the man bears a gl@@ os@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he still can carry the weapon with themselves , so the police . &quot;
&quot; who Sven S. sees , the 110 should call . &quot;
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship &quot; relationship .
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator 1981 . &quot;
&quot; in Lübeck , the responsible police in Lübeck did not want to do any information on the T@@ ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; but they confirmed that a man was killed . &quot;

steel - light@@ view for German steel industry
the kr@@ isen@@ ge@@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in million euros .
&quot; financial burden that the industry from the oil promotion , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it lead to the exemp@@ tion from the renewable energies revers@@ al in the components for the so @-@ called peculi@@ ar production in the German St@@ ah@@ lin@@ ens industry , said Federal Ministry of Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Fri@@ ag@@ ram ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years .
&quot; according to the European Commission , the European Commission was initially planned , the steel manufacturer , the gases from the testi@@ s to use for its own consumption , to ask for the cas@@ hier . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry , the steel industry is an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , it now give a fundamental certificate with the EU Commission to talks with competition com@@ miss@@ able Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators used to be replaced in the steel works , a E@@ EG re@@ position of 20 percent . &quot;
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall greeted the unification of Germany with the EU Commission for self @-@ power generation .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely fixed . &quot;
special meaning have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is the future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the emissions ri@@ vals , climate and employment targets are weak@@ ened , &quot; explained IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis in 2008 and a considerable price pressure .
&quot; last year , the situation has exac@@ erb@@ ated as the world &apos;s largest revival in China in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand of mass@@ aging steel on the world market . &quot;
European manufacturer throw Chinese steel t@@ weak prize dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring the situation has something relaxed .
&quot; for one hand , im@@ min@@ ate duties on im@@ port@@ ant effect , for others , the economic views in China have turned up . &quot;
unclear how lasting the price @-@ up is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices would have gone back more stag@@ nat@@ ing . &quot;
the sector is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp also wanted to exclu@@ de the closing of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , there were around 86@@ ,000 people at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July the German steel manufacturer remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3,4 million tons , they produced a good six percent less raw material than in the prior @-@ year months , as well as the economic association of steel on Friday . &quot;
after a short increase in May the first amount of time went back to the second month of a row .
&quot; since the year of the year , production is worth two percent below the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the Association expects an improved order intake in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing doing seniors good &quot;
&quot; S@@ ingen has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the school studies , she took the fo@@ ach music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a seniors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; describes it . &quot;
&quot; after a sample they feel balanced , cheerful and overall lively , says it . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , they are doing something good at their health and mind . &quot;
&quot; because S@@ ingen is the same from several perspectives , a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard Hac@@ kler from the German senior Bundes@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most seniors singing in chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded the joy in music , describes Hac@@ kler . &quot;
through regular inter@@ iors can soci@@ alise social contacts and maintain .
&quot; we often solve social and family structures at the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and to organize themselves to another , and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being . &quot;
&quot; sing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says Hac@@ kler . &quot;
because they are exercising a deep and controlled breathing .
who regularly asks his lungs as well as in everyday life is not so fast out of the pu@@ ste .
&quot; even though it is about getting the sound of voice in old age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older men , S@@ ingen is often a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz by the Federal Association of senior senior organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the joint S@@ ingen had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains it . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often observed that the singing or hearing of songs in older people suffer many memories , often linked to positive emotions of their youth . &quot;
through Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially melo@@ dies themselves denied men deny people back to long left events .
&quot; in singing , the head is also given a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
at the same time focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; just older people who alone live , practice so , not just concentrate on themselves . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through the singing in the choir .
a enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem grows through the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show themselves : if I have long been for something , I will become better and watch@@ ful about me - this experience strength@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to begin with singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means , little talent to have , betra@@ yed L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; one also sings not alone - with 50 sin@@ ful people who h@@ ears there , if a sound goes beside it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the suitable offer , seniors have different possibilities , says Hac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; sing someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior choir , one can simply connect . &quot;
many cities also provide over@@ views of the cho@@ irs in the area .
&quot; who wants to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic choir , can turn right to the church or the Church &apos;s Church . &quot;
many Sen@@ or@@ ench@@ cho@@ irs can also be found via the Internet .
&quot; who does not have access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet . &quot;
&quot; who would like to sing , should necessarily join a choir , in the Hac@@ der . &quot;
singing the soul well and has something fre@@ eing - this applies to any age .
cats react sensitive as k@@ ater on scre@@ ams of the young animals
&quot; bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover , which effect the ru@@ stling of cat bab@@ ys on adult animals . &quot;
&quot; to her surprise , the b@@ ust also left the males not cold - however , they kept in contrast to the females always equal . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arousal level of cat bab@@ ys on the rental of the little ones .
they react to ten percent faster than lu@@ te of kitt@@ ens who have found themselves in great need as scientists from the veterinary university and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
&quot; cr@@ ater also react to the back@@ rest of kitt@@ ens - however , always equal . &quot;
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ gh@@ ening of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males either not percep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is the first@@ born in the study , published on this Friday in the &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous examination , the research team had already found that the duration and sound @-@ height of the kitt@@ ens scre@@ ened with the ur@@ gency of their aid . &quot;
&quot; in total , nine adult men and eight c@@ esses have been observed out of the MH@@ H . &quot;
they were pre @-@ played for a rod of little ones who were taken for three minutes from the litter box and separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger kitt@@ ens who were in addition high @-@ lifted up . &quot;
the researchers keep their results despite the low value of rehear@@ sal .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted upon the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned out faster to the l@@ oud@@ speakers if this rod played the very well @-@ reg@@ ained kitt@@ ens .
this ability may be in@@ ju@@ red or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men in the past several times in the past .
&quot; some studies demonstrated that women are sensitive on inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already mothers , or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is in Turkey a football Legend .
in Turkey the football @-@ star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver had been adopted in Turkey .
he was accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup will be held again , in Turkey again an important football match . &quot;
in front of the du@@ el of the arch@@ al between B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ in Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
&quot; even at the suspension of the exp@@ ir@@ ation after the crash , the government , the daily life of norm@@ ali@@ ases cannot be affected . &quot;
&quot; however , this applies not to those who are diges@@ ted , the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len belong to whom you are responsible for the coup . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , even before football is not made . &quot;
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver presented the prosec@@ ut@@ or to a rest warran@@ t .
&quot; according to the meantime , the sweet@@ ness of a terrorist group is now being accused , member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ ver is meant to be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup . &quot;
&quot; while at first , the first for 90 days is still pending until October , in fact it has on the life of most Turks but as good as no effect . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ whales &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday . &quot;
sports is - as the whole country - split in trailer and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the worker @-@ club B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
&quot; but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks , but considering the dramatic experience in history , is the strict rejection of military coup . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart be@@ ats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as .
at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; will be especially arrive at Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
its sporting value presented the Köl@@ ner in the derived season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first game time as a Top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 @-@ winning ffer .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK , &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured his crew the cup .
&quot; thanks &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; found the disappointing season for record a failed conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the Vor@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; is also made up early in the Europa League . &quot;
in the South by Li@@ g it only took place to rank six .
the season was not good .
the Cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; this is what we managed and this is the most important , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot;
for Master B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as the game was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez with 26 Seas@@ on@@ ers as South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ri@@ gs the base of the 14th Tit@@ le .
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to return to the return of 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; with the AC Florence under the contract and on B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as , the Gom@@ ez was announced shortly after the coup , because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say that the &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; club manager Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the falls would have to be ready to for@@ end about a third of his to 7.5 million euros . Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; &quot; its sal@@ ary at Florence we cannot pay . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have even medalli@@ sts opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was locked twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa may not start in Rio .
others over@@ led athle@@ tics sinn@@ ers can only lau@@ gh - they fight in Rio to medals .
the issue of dop@@ ing determines how the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer@@ ing in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa who suffered after a dop@@ ing lock her start @-@ up just before the games , was rec@@ alled at their start ( 100 meter chest ) mer@@ c@@ ading and f@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; it offered itself a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scenario : with a sp@@ icy smile she was still sitting in the hall , and had prov@@ oked with her performance . &quot;
&quot; being able that it won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ub@@ el@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many more athletes , who despite dop@@ ing past go to start at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in the athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked two times because of D@@ op@@ ings closed ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell , the Olympi@@ asi@@ eger of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion runs even faster than before , he is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered as the biggest dig@@ it of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ ad and si@@ eben@@ fold World Cup in 2010 had to sit a six@@ sm@@ on@@ ati@@ cal sper@@ re , after taking the intake of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after a surgery I had strong dental pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defended . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 was tested the Olympi@@ ad of 2012 , World Cup in 2013 and European Championship in 2010 to 2016 positive on the bot@@ ene stimul@@ ant method of Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine . &quot;
Per@@ kovic bes@@ tos the wis@@ ely intake and was locked six months .
the four most wid@@ est thro@@ ws in this year go to the account of the great gold@@ ones .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ eger and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , 2010 was positively tested and 21 months been locked . &quot;
&quot; had been responsible for penis enlargement , bed @-@ riding . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the fastest man in the world . &quot;
&quot; I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any ath@@ l@@ ete were detected as many medals . &quot;
&quot; so , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having been determined by him testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had also had to exp@@ ose @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ings and the EM @-@ Tit@@ le 2006 because of testosterone abuse . &quot;
&quot; the recognized Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the Olympic Games in 2008 received due to a jud@@ gement of the International Spor@@ ts@@ ystem CAS . &quot;
with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is on rank two of the world list .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the World fi@@ k@@ ord@@ al and Gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was only tested in May positive , but may nevertheless start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; during the 29 years old World Championship , references have been found on the intake of a ban supplement , the sper@@ re of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency W@@ ada fell apart and ran already on 13 July . &quot;
bom@@ ben@@ ding in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ in@@ ers - multi @-@ dead t@@ aves
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ soon . &quot;
&quot; she suffered a schn@@ apps , and be treated in the hospital , but have already left it again . &quot;
it was planned for early September .
&quot; whether from the other explo@@ sions on the holidays Ph@@ uk@@ et , as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on , Austrian citizens are still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the State Department stand in relation with local authorities , so mu@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; at some 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hua H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a footh@@ ills of two bom@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; according to police , an Tha@@ il@@ altered in killed and about 20 people have been in@@ ju@@ red , among them the Austri@@ ans , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; we went up again two Spr@@ eng@@ ages again , according to the authorities a further man was killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et was reported in the morning a bom@@ bs .
at the Det@@ on@@ ation near the hotel popular Bad@@ estr@@ ands Pat@@ ong has been in@@ ju@@ red by police information for a taxi driver .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the southeast coast of the country , then a further bom@@ b , which was a city of a city . &quot;
the spr@@ int is according to the authorities in a flo@@ wer@@ et in front of the front of the coastal police force in the air .
&quot; finally , they called for det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g at the south @-@ west coast as well as Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on at the south @-@ eastern coast . &quot;
&quot; one go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , called it . &quot;
&quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ ent@@ ates carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said Ar@@ ab@@ eral Dan@@ ai criteria Fri@@ day@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ day@@ early in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves for possible moti@@ fs - probably , it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
also Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern on the attacks which is typical for the bom@@ bing mus@@ li@@ zed separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police on the other , stated , the attacks are not related to the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
it is rather that the bom@@ bs were laid down by oppos@@ ers of the ruling military j@@ unt@@ a .
&quot; in recent days , the authorities could have received secrets on im@@ pending attacks in the South of the country - but they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
yet it is unclear that group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police pointed its officials in the whole country to increase security around important governmental buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement areas . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ bing ra@@ inf@@ all , but they usually do not focus against tourists . &quot;
in Hua H@@ in lies a palace built over the years of Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the knowledge of the bom@@ b@@ ance bom@@ b explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry in his homepage is recommended to provide the instructions of Thai safety authorities as a result . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) performed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; according to disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there are no necessary trips to this provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday was a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military j@@ unt@@ a .
this spatial capacity to the military has a great influence in the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bom@@ bs have been an attempt to overcome chaos while the country toward stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military unt@@ a , which took power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest the power holds itself good , the kingdom has again led to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not have succeeded in getting a handle for years in the extreme south of the country &apos;s u@@ prising in the world . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
a year ago in Bangkok was killed in Bangkok at a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists were killed .
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identi@@ fier movement &quot; is into the vision@@ ary of the federal state for Constitutional protection .
&quot; after several countries , the Constitutional Treaty also provided the group under observation of the group . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; cl@@ ue &quot; &quot; for aspirations against the free democratic principles , &quot; said constitutional chef Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the Deutsche Presse Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
thus the revival of other Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ using in extrem@@ ist way .
&quot; therefore , we observe the movement now also . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it is turning towards &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controll@@ able mass immigration and the &quot; loss of their own identity by exagger@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Constitutional in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said that his authority have been closely aligned with the state &apos;s decision .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ty movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Treaty . &quot;
&quot; in general , Extre@@ mi@@ sts are trying to address her with adol@@ escent language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
&quot; the Islam@@ ists , as well as legal extreme . &quot;
this is not a concrete advertising for their own cause .
propaganda aims to speak the people emotion@@ ally .
young people are very vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , from several federal states had given reports on contacts of &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; to the Af@@ D @-@ politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have a knowledge . &quot;
for the constitutional protection possible contacts of this species is only relevant from a certain point .
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , which are extrem@@ ist , their goal is changing and thus extrem@@ ist extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is crucial to whether such people have controlled influence on the party . &quot;
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view of the distinct increase of legal crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee information , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new rights in this context . &quot;
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be legal structures in the past few years .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the first group .
&quot; it may well be that other legal groups of legal groups or inf@@ ants form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other far @-@ extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
a nation@@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of rect@@ ster@@ ror@@ ism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were developed on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; did Ma@@ ate about it , that many over@@ gri@@ ps went to the account of people who were not in the right scene in the right scene . &quot;
this is the worrying .
&quot; many of the fact of attack on asylum seek@@ ers were not known as a crime , politically motivated pen@@ al or pend@@ ant of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes committed before with right @-@ extre@@ mi@@ sts , which were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left were elected by far right @-@ wing mood . &quot;

this shows the brave appearance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer playing in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center spon@@ ge the slightly overweight swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia so slowly that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was chosen .

&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a return of 48 seconds with a return and loaded the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather its not a spor@@ ty figure that attracted attention to international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old nevertheless takes part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in un@@ represented countries .
&quot; there most athletes walk , Have I just wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparing is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nickname did the lap .
some media marked him as &quot; RO@@ BEL of the whale . &quot;
&quot; in relation to a &quot; &quot; well @-@ being &quot; &quot; made the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ ant &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; about him funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of free@@ ze , there played no part . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .

&quot; the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old had to swim only eight months before Olympia , and had never been a long distance before the competition . &quot;

accidents - Bus slip in Kru@@ mm@@ h@@ n in Gr@@ ad : eight Ver@@ last
&quot; with an accident of a travel agency with 43 seniors as passengers , on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ audi@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) eight people have been in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; two of the people suffered severe injuries , divided the police with them . &quot;
&quot; the 66 years old driver of the bus company from Eisen@@ ach had to pass according to their information according to their claims , which were partly on the opposite way . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a speaker of the police Aur@@ me / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independent , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire fighting fre@@ ite the in@@ mates .
six b@@ ail@@ out cars and a not@@ ebooks came to the accident on the state road 2 .
the un@@ last travelers were brought back by a line bus back to the Kru@@ mm@@ age district P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare @-@ bus service .
the investig@@ ators demanded the load @-@ experience and possible witnesses to sign up in the police .
&quot; fees per Ku@@ bi@@ km@@ eter se@@ wage are from 1st October 2016 for the area of the dra@@ inage Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of so far . Euro ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( up to 18 Euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will then increase once again if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
after a sle@@ epy lim@@ ation at the Az@@ endorf then at 4,@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was found in the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rat@@ um Kul@@ mb@@ ach that apply to these se@@ wage systems . &quot;
the market of Kas@@ endorf is oblig@@ ated due to a legal basis to operate facilities as a result of a legal basis .
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from the world , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg must take deeper into the money bag . &quot;
the mix@@ tures are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as administrative manager , Herbert Schmidt showed the body , was necessary for re @-@ escal@@ ation of the fees for the se@@ wage systems of the market community . &quot;
&quot; during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ covers from the previous calendar period . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ vi@@ zing prayers en@@ forced Schmidt so that it is with all three se@@ wage systems to relatively small facilities with a very low dra@@ inage , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the limited distribution basis , for example , expenses for the repairs of several thousand Euros is serious . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the wast@@ ew@@ ater in all three plants are easy to handle . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the backward calendar period , in all three systems , not least because of its age of san@@ itation and repair @-@ consuming in a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for puppy , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the dra@@ inage Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to a damage .
&quot; the p@@ ump@@ werk Whi@@ ch had to be over@@ hau@@ led the nearly 20 years old conveyor belts , and in the bat@@ ching position Lop@@ p had to be installed after almost 20 years of operation the first Kl@@ är@@ tei@@ ch , the stap@@ le mud , and an additional ventilation to keep in accordance with the water legal requirements also in future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary performance came the advanced work@@ stations and maintenance costs , which are to be considered accordingly in the new calendar period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which are still considerably below the current level of calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
quar@@ ry made clear that at low wast@@ ew@@ ing fall in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance .
&quot; in doing so , suppl@@ em@@ powered Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs for the se@@ wage systems in the past 20 years remained spar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the aforementioned systems will continue to be prec@@ arious , especially since you can &apos;t expand the supply area of the waste @-@ purpose Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal Valley in order to extend these systems because it is a deficit facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria cho@@ oses for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 % was based on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) , and the first over zero since October last year , as a positive 0.2 % . &quot;
the annual de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1,0 % . &quot;
in@@ flow rates since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was compared -@@ 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 were compared to July 2015 -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non @-@ talented beverages ( 1.9 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.@@ 3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
&quot; prices fell on clothes and shoes ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , household appliances and routine ew@@ ays ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) . &quot;

Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; and critic@@ ised as an Asian caric@@ ature
Snap@@ chat says that this filter Ani@@ me is inspired but some observers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel opposite races .
&quot; with its filter@@ tool , it enables Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure made of a Roy Lich@@ ten@@ stein paintings . &quot;
&quot; the filters are imm@@ utable , self @-@ captiv@@ ated tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ ections per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps get to the public .
&quot; Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past , in which they were accused , that the app Black@@ face fo@@ ams or white skin as beauty of beauty would act . &quot;
&quot; when this week proposed a filter a filter that gave them sle@@ eves , false teeth and dis@@ sent che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow @-@ face . &quot; &quot;
they asked whether these repeti@@ tive contro@@ versy sur@@ faced to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and the rebellion were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it has disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ standing , which have experienced r@@ is@@ atism , reminded the filter of viol@@ ating cl@@ ues . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et have been widely used over the photos that the filter is hur@@ t@@ ful and l@@ ap@@ it@@ ant was unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very contradic@@ tory Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ lo@@ wered , but that the yellow @-@ face was with@@ drawn . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dra@@ in .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in a endless diet and integration process , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in the stuff as their older counter@@ players - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters create a picture that is much more difficult for a user , so it &apos;s much more difficult that such things were un@@ noticed when it was formerly the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided to work as a product man@@ ag@@ ator and engineering in for medium to delete the Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that rac@@ ant contro@@ versy reflect a lack of diversity in the setting @-@ making practices at Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu cri@@ tici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and ended their attachment with a has@@ ht@@ ag , # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors , who work there , but not in positions in which they are safe or feeling to say about what to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers on diversity of its employees and points to its status as private companies .
&quot; on Thursday , there was Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company has recently focused on a personnel responsible who focused on under@@ presented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said that she is closed her Snap@@ chat account , and added , &quot; I ask myself if they need more users like us to say that this is not OK . &quot;
military leadership distor@@ ted ISIS intelligence information ; represents the Committee of Congress
&quot; lac@@ tation members of the United States Central Command changed ci@@ enti@@ ary information to draw an optimum picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islam@@ ic state in Iraq and Syria , as it would have been allowed the real states of Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Joint Committee of Defence , secrecy and the defence bud@@ get@@ ary , reported by a great satisfaction among Central Command Secret Doc@@ s , who reported how pre @-@ set up their ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents to the US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short Cen@@ is , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls the American dairy farmers in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news information , which were sent from high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ ders typically , signed a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it would have been allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive as analysis of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened during the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ cans member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership errors in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ pages report shows detailed subsequent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in the education of the Iraqi armed forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that the heads in Obama will have given reports to change the reports , how an@@ al@@ ysts saw the pressure from its predec@@ essors , an optim@@ istic image of the threat to the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half @-@ year 2015 , many Central Command press releases and statements made considerably more positive than the facts presented to the Congress . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com cred@@ itors publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , it is so much clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ cans of member of K@@ ansas , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of the year 2014 until the mid @-@ year 2015 , the Heads of Central Command had changed the following reports to play the danger caused by ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the republi@@ cans called the Task Force to live after them that analy@@ st was worried about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge while investigations will be continued .
&quot; in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Direc@@ torate of Defense Ministry . &quot;
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published on Thursday their own findings , which coinci@@ des with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of post @-@ performance estimates regarding IS@@ IL and the Iraqi Security Services , &quot; gave the highest priority democr@@ at in the Com@@ er@@ ee , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Ship , in an opinion known . &quot;
&quot; this process , such as Mr. Ship , &quot; consumed the publication of post @-@ creators reports , &quot; the mor@@ als of an@@ al@@ ysts , and &quot; gave excessive little room for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Ship and Democrats gave no evidence of an intervention of the White House in the Cent@@ Com analyses in terms of &quot; certain political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the issu@@ ations of Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
&quot; in the past August the New York Times reported by the Direc@@ torate of the Pentagon , which were recorded after complaints from Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Defence Minister has no reports of Congress , while investig@@ ators of the general spec@@ tors still be underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave to that &quot; experts sometimes have different diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense have welcomed a contro@@ versy discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investig@@ ators have re@@ percus@@ sions about the question of a successful airline campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a asser@@ tion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have however raised the question , how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest estimates of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism with regard to the secret information about the Islam@@ ic state recall , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about how the former government visited by George W. Bush on the recommendations of many an@@ al@@ ysts in Iraq and have little time on it to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker after the statement of government agencies that have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical refinement had put into operation since these pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical refinement would have to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times in September . &quot;
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ aging owner , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III was critic@@ ised by members of the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure in a hearing prior to the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of women who stands a show@@ down with Great Britain before
&quot; one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 seal over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field@@ ho@@ ckey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , she could not remember that ever . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I am not among the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , they know , however , the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britain on the first place , which will remain un@@ be@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first lap .
&quot; both teams have already been qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two in their group will gain from six teams in the first and second place . &quot;
&quot; the first @-@ placed will take a little longer from the way , which the other group will lead . &quot;
&quot; as always the game may start on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after having landed over the last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years in his hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national role in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 because she could not qualify for the K@@ ader .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team did everything wrong . &quot;
&quot; during the year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , Trainer of the National Team , and thereby the things began to address better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , an mental change and a physical change &quot; , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the working party in London that we now have .
we have completely over@@ drive the ruin .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the scor@@ ching in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the Middle area .
&quot; India was gone without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed herself surprising and kept the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball via the left fl@@ anges , then moved to the center and l@@ up@@ set the ball into the gate to get a 2 @-@ 0 guidance . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ alies of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , which had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in good position , &quot; &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ins &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , there are the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro , the events in Rio de Janeiro do not feel stable and in@@ capable of a rapid run of competition and pursuit of competition . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the oly@@ mp@@ ic F@@ ack@@ et itself would be a burning st@@ ab , which is used by the w@@ rist@@ watch for swimm@@ ers to the Tur@@ ner to the Tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t switch to the TV to read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the queue in the coff@@ in hop , without about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is still Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could certainly have been sent among these known names that would be sent to Prime Time , which would be a swi@@ mmer , Tur@@ ner or even F@@ real . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the Olympic Tramp@@ oline for gold . &quot;
the oly@@ mp@@ ic flame is not lit up every event .
&quot; further from the center , partially in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air spray , Archery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the chest swimming and may last for a long time .
&quot; but if I might be modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ oline jump has already been a oly@@ mp@@ ic event , when it had been a oly@@ mp@@ ic event , it was the last 16 years so pointed out that many those who asked I did not know that it is at all an Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the US was sent athletes to competition , it has never had a medal in the tramp@@ oline jump , and until 2012 has had an ath@@ l@@ ete which has succeeded until the final wound . &quot;
the Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans who share for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend its gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ ski@@ p has a certain outside char@@ me , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ resolved ear for a Clo@@ wn@@ school as the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a sublime enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ ous potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ ous tre@@ m@@ bling of his never to end m@@ alls - but also the Grazie of the gymn@@ asium , the two sports that combines two sports . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; jumping winner jump on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and must end a number of falling movements ( turning , p@@ ale and sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet . &quot;
&quot; they are evaluated according to the National Olympi@@ apro@@ gram after execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ thirty athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio against each other . &quot;
the general oly@@ mp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight .
&quot; medalli@@ sts need in their quest for gold continued , faster , gradually go above , sometimes up to the target , sometimes back and back , down and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; it is not only hunting the dial or the output wall , but in the television transmission , also another height of the world , the world , or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the pur@@ pos@@ eful quest is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even sti@@ r a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I decide to look at these games as something aw@@ ful .
with it the tramp@@ oline offers an at@@ emp@@ ause .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline @-@ jum@@ per is above .
a for@@ wards movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an astr@@ on@@ aut , goes down , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back to the top . &quot;
&quot; there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no cur@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and end of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in stre@@ aming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will exp@@ ose the final cleaning as part of an afternoon blocks on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of Olympia Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one which is probably over@@ looked in the general tumor . &quot;
&quot; if the consciousness au@@ ction only can be achieved through the att@@ aff@@ es and the object of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his according to air rin@@ se , new fan@@ ati@@ le . &quot;
&quot; a generation protest &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia , rel@@ ying on violent resistance of the government . &quot;
witnesses say that zig @-@ protest during the cl@@ ashes with the police have been killed in stri@@ kers .
is Ethiopia straight together ?
&quot; over the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid union of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the past few months , protests against the government in the past few months have become more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people on the streets and slo@@ wed fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave witnesses that polic@@ emen shot in zig @-@ armed prot@@ esters and t@@ öt@@ ed .
&quot; in turn @-@ well @-@ being videos about the protests , probably from the last or early of this year , show how security men hit young people with sticks , while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the chief of the UN Office of Human Rights is now asking for a more detailed investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country and in future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated land of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians along to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa when at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian Economy is expanding in considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new approach in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , whereby Dis@@ pres@@ idents are effective for silence . &quot;
&quot; many have been sent to exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you press people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lectur@@ er in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
all the youth are protest .
a generation is prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground use to the wor@@ ms in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a struggle for this z@@ acked , controversial line demanded in June hundreds of life . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo liberation front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of O@@ g@@ aden , who have been imposed in recent years more or less , the tur@@ mo@@ il are useless and themselves to be armed again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years has now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with social media since cheap smartphones have become more frequent and improved the Internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are in regular intervals , does many people still communicate more about Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave to the fact that they were gathered so on protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for the ons of prosp@@ eri@@ ed the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , mainly Christian flood , in politics and economy , while they live the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in flat @-@ regions . &quot;
but that is also changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate on a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests found in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many of Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is in@@ vigor@@ ously dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which are around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in commerce and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former Reb@@ els leader , was until his death at a non @-@ publi@@ cally established disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
&quot; an@@ al@@ ysts say that it was especially sealed in it , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to deal with opponents and make them un@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively und@@ et@@ ched reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of Nord@@ ä@@ Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
an@@ al@@ ysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tig@@ ray @-@ controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia was experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands against elections prot@@ ested according to the analy@@ st , according to the analy@@ st and were stolen by the government . &quot;
&quot; during the following swe@@ eps many prot@@ esti@@ cks were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised the Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , as the new pend@@ ant move , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ norm@@ alities of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month of attacked prot@@ esti@@ cks in gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ic city , by Tig@@ ray @-@ guided shops and the hat@@ red towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming ever more common in social media . &quot;
an@@ al@@ ysts say that the protests the US and other Western allies can bring a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ tours across the neigh@@ b@@ oured Somalia , even though they recently rus@@ hed that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; during the West he clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want its allies in an already vol@@ ati@@ ful region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin dig@@ it migration . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his asser@@ tion of Obama was founded &quot; &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ m &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp was trying to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last contro@@ versy that surrounds his campaign that his repeatedly repeti@@ tive asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fies new questions concerning the communication skills of the presidential data of the Republi@@ can , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand the public public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his co @-@ ordin@@ ating to take him during an event@@ ful stage in protecting , into the peculi@@ ar position , declar@@ ations that he could not meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after having done the clear@@ ing event at the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ rome evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp was taken with regard to the Cla@@ im on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to identify the President and Mrs. Clinton . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday said Mr. Tru@@ mp , he is simply sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ man Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to weak@@ en the statement of something that Mr. Obama ISIS wants to destroy him , wanted to know the Republi@@ can presidential did@@ did@@ at . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ selt to Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he is trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of random rel@@ inqu@@ ishment on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp was trying to return to this topic again .
&quot; on Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought back to its defense .
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism to himself , when he said , the Russians ought to h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ tons of emails , but later he said later . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then return to their needs .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages will be recorded by his fans , as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; &quot; according to how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , which observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ age enough so that it can be interpreted in different ways .
&quot; rather than the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has taken an even estim@@ ation of the sound , since its revers@@ al values went further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was released on Friday , showed a tour with great lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally temp@@ ted to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently accused his critics frequently , his statements to fal@@ ren or his hum@@ our of humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he has reinforced the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze his loyal co @-@ ordin@@ ances to stand up to him irrespective of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may also be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s prominent speakers , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani was asked for the accuracy of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton would have established the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ rest , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstre@@ am Republi@@ can attempt to argue that the government used under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as a foreign minister , it was allowed to extend the situation in the Middle East aggressi@@ vely under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and cast them out before , to ride out on each of his words , and to be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he distor@@ ed the &quot; poor , j@@ it@@ mer@@ ly &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; you cannot do it ! . &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats informed about Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s ap@@ ology as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once upon the price of the market , Café is back in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a compens@@ ated café in Williamsburg , where one could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but 15 years for good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from its Bedford Avenue store was gone . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sold soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people smo@@ ked it as the last loss in a gene@@ alog@@ ical city .
&quot; the artist in Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ etta wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap @-@ shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is , it is also new . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ bel@@ ated verb Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long@@ time employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began to work in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered a customer to provide money for a new out@@ land , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , ha@@ iled much . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ som@@ atic model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he brought new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wich@@ es with bac@@ on and cheese and there are clo@@ cks such as cap@@ tures and su@@ ed oni@@ ons .
there are natural bars .
&quot; there is no beer for coffee , there is fresh juice . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a st@@ amped current of old stem customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers have also gone through prizes from Williamsburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , dwelt in Williamsburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after Green@@ point she was drawn , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the Ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee p@@ ouch on , she said . &quot;
&quot; I was clear that there was the coffee and the culture in the verb who fell on me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee , even if they ordered on this day instead of their usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ees a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the release in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered inev@@ itably the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Foto Rodri@@ guez said , he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still its usual order , but sometimes he will be changing his Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he won &apos;t have a di@@ ll in fact that the soap @-@ business has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie on a special soap for bon@@ b with the cold @-@ rich coffee of coffee can be used as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish , and Rodri@@ guez said that he has pre@@ ached her to make them soon , so that his new neighbours are welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local squ@@ aft@@ locally wants to fill the cold coffee in bottles and sell .
there is a chance that there is a café on a dis@@ b@@ art@@ es building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was tri@@ bal and said that he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the prayer of the Lok@@ as and the bri@@ ghter a new coffee was like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to cra@@ wl that , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in an abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascen@@ sion to the president , Franklin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as a fine @-@ decor@@ ating President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a Fai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ik@@ at@@ essen the Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Water@@ tur@@ tles soup .
&quot; his menu on this day was something hum@@ ble : ge@@ filled eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , potato p@@ ü@@ ree and as dessert a Pfl@@ au@@ st@@ pu@@ d@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with silent people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ an .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was told by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , as they meet with a re@@ por@@ ter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em Im@@ bis@@ s in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh che@@ es@@ and@@ wich with olive trees , while co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with mas@@ hed and vegetable stock . &quot;
&quot; as the re@@ por@@ ter h@@ ackers ordered , this took the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of great depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was Erd@@ uss@@ bro@@ t , Leb@@ anese and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and some fine cooked that leads the ingredient .
imagine so many Erd@@ nuts to eat that they serve them as a dinner .
Co@@ e sm@@ ir@@ ks .
&quot; it must have put in the stomach as a lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression was the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , a All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served fresh baked pasta for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; there were the Americans who sent to hungry Europeans during the first WW@@ I . &quot; A Square n &quot; stands out the ways in which the country went with it , no longer the mud . &quot;
&quot; it was a time , in the food for the Americans was a central , tense issue , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as tense was the new bud@@ get@@ y : mysterious foods such as Br@@ ote and Kas@@ ser@@ ollen were called to stap@@ le food , the Kas@@ ser@@ w@@ ool as &quot; wonderful kind , food remains un@@ familiar , since coo@@ ks un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients were able to hide from a kre@@ mi@@ gen Sau@@ ce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dr@@ y@@ ob@@ st .
&quot; meat , for years the center of the American cuisine was , became a rarely ser@@ fourth luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculi@@ ar mix@@ tures have been tried , as a cal@@ orie cal@@ orie and rewar@@ ding satisfaction had to prevail over taste or even a healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book that also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man a dish made of this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ anu@@ t butter , too . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement on lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man leads further from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ anu@@ t butter and baked oni@@ ons do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the business recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , fiscal poli@@ tico - including Louise Stan@@ ley , Leit@@ ner of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country such as such . &quot;
&quot; identifying recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraging women to become &quot; household aid &quot; and the challenge to transform Pamp@@ e such as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; is a festival of historic delicacies . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports of the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ food attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa farms in his kitchen , which he won like the milli@@ on@@ ful man of the world , to whom he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed menu and carried a smo@@ king .
he was del@@ ici@@ ously realistic .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ ute with his stomach to stat@@ ute .
&quot; as described in the book , the council described in a household with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House brought forth the boring food in Washington but also one of the most prepared food prepared . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of great depression , with food handle , was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
the pair gave me better understood in writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man @-@ in @-@ law better - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded : &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind of wind .
&quot; after the T@@ eller at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s cleared up , they moved and Co@@ e a dessert that had made them home : the peg@@ s , the president Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had to be lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a di@@ m@@ able trick , hum@@ ble to miss a name . &quot;
&quot; there was no stor@@ ing cream , only pl@@ ying , little flour , sugar , water and c@@ innamon . &quot;
&quot; each de@@ af a bit rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly a spo@@ on in the teeth , brown @-@ b@@ ber one . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , it was not bad . &quot;
co@@ e pick up three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer said to his wife , &quot; A few ch@@ opped Wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
by bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o
he set his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar devoted his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ki@@ ed everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died on a facade attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group , which saved according to image newspaper so far just about 6@@ 0,000 people . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own life on the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses , and to make first aid in the war . &quot;
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of the civil servant , which shows him with a 11 @-@ hour saving of a house , went to the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans of the shining symbol@@ ism in the Gre@@ ys of war .
&quot; but as a hero he never saw himself , but according to picture : &quot; for me , that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I can save life , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Om@@ ar himself was an attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ances in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helic@@ opter have res@@ cu@@ ed four facade bom@@ bs over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with Ch@@ l@@ org@@ as . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the toxic rem@@ n@@ ants of the bom@@ b , so that not children play with it , &quot; c@@ ites the picture of his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bom@@ b of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Grön@@ land shar@@ k : the oldest sp@@ tier is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land often come only in winter at the surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination on board of the research papers S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with good one 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land get first with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; the Greenland flo@@ wed of Greenland at the bottom of the Nor@@ dat@@ lan@@ ti@@ ks , in an hour he is on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it occurs , acceler@@ ates five meters long animal on top 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot;
this long @-@ shaped lifestyle seems to be a silver bul@@ let for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science &quot; at any rate of Greenland who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity &quot; , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ y@@ lein by Max @-@ Plan@@ ck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life span , which means for sp@@ inal animals a world record . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist has long been that Grön@@ land @-@ ha@@ ie become rocky . &quot;
only faul@@ ted the evidence .
&quot; Grön@@ land ha@@ ie are hard to observe , eventually they live mainly in the ice sea before the sk@@ inny co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperature around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive at the surface mostly only in winter . &quot;
about the lifestyle of Greenland know researchers accordingly little .
her Zeit@@ l@@ up@@ emp@@ o Ma@@ ßen they came from S@@ val@@ bard six animals with a transm@@ itter equipment .
&quot; loo@@ t make this shar@@ ks anyway : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the rem@@ n@@ ants of a Rob@@ be , another one had sh@@ utt@@ led the or@@ tho@@ ff of a young king@@ doms . &quot;
&quot; possibly chase them sleeping animals or pat@@ rolling the bottom of the ice cream , and seek car@@ c@@ asses , which tor@@ ches from higher water layers to bottom . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues were now examined 28 Grön@@ land @-@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen as a co @-@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ timeters long , during the largest 5@@ 02 cen@@ timeters . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of animals , analy@@ zes them with the carbon @-@ 14 method of the lens of shar@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the ey@@ eb@@ row occurs already before the birth of shar@@ ks , which are contained in it later no longer re@@ done . &quot;
the two smallest hat@@ red had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ eup .
&quot; its birth should therefore lie according to the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons , greater amounts of this radi@@ ant carbon is dis@@ cour@@ aged in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in which with 220 cen@@ timeters in length of third animal , the Lin@@ sen@@ ker try a low excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
all major Greenland ha@@ ie had in their lens against normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities which arises from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeters in Greenland a age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 cen@@ timeters even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland females only then got descendants if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers of the length could be assigned an age . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals had been determined with 3@@ 92 cen@@ timeters on the threshold of the sex mature and his age was determined with 156 years , Grön@@ land with the multip@@ lication obviously was at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this might also be the case for sp@@ inal animals currently .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; also the previous record holder , a 211 years old Greenland landed in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 years old har@@ ness@@ ed head , was captured before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures often the organism of the animals live in &quot; &quot; Spar@@ fl@@ ames &quot; . &quot; &quot;
so you attack later - and al@@ tern slower .
&quot; to keep warm in cold water warm , the animals are often particularly large . &quot;
&quot; for the volume grows much faster than its surface , due to the animal heat . &quot;
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of El@@ eph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate as many descendants as soon as possible , &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot;
a very big animal should invest in contrast its resources rather in a long life .
timber in double pack
&quot; with themes around the building , the municipal council has focused on the most recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief the committees took the message of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the younger residential areas can start . &quot;
&quot; after the property , par@@ zel@@ li@@ ction - and final questions have been clari@@ fied and the applications were placed on Ver@@ messung , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; Road l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Out@@ scale section 1 ) to those interested in those who do nothing more in the way . &quot;
&quot; the municipal council is convinced that the areas of the rural areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families , and pure senior citizens alike . &quot;
&quot; as it meant , buil@@ ders can report immediately in the city hall , over the transmission of plots , the municipal council is expected to advise in his September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to also requests requests for the settlement of other commercial businesses , connected to the creation of jobs , to come back , decided to change the municipal plan in early Spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the area of the Lower Saxony , it is already extended in the area around two plots direction of State Highway 2112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg the best opportunities to attract and attract companies from London , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt am most from Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of Excellence , financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses are further operated by London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass , it is up to date for approval in the UK . &quot;
this is currently using large US banks .
several banks have already announced their jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; counts with 10000 new jobs on the Main bin@@ nen five years . &quot;

&quot; in Paris the organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;

Frankfurt is much easier to reach from Frankfurt thanks to the great airport .

&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors . &quot;

Clin@@ tons deserve EUR 75 million in 2015 and pay 34,@@ 2 % Federal control
Hill@@ ary Clinton released its tax declaration on Friday this flo@@ wed for the presidential election of Democrats and her husband to gain a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 34,@@ 2 % .
&quot; in 2015 the Clin@@ tons USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton gave an income of USD 3 million in Rede@@ emer , and the former Foreign Minister for her book on their office in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons of candidate for the Vice @-@ Presidents , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his control of the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20,@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ tons Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ per gave Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in a cr@@ ut@@ ches , Donald Tru@@ mp hidden behind wrong align@@ ments and rel@@ ying with regard to his previous promises to publish its tax statements . &quot;
&quot; it is common to publish US presidential data to publish its tax evasion , although they are not committed by law because of this . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New Yorker &apos;s busin@@ es@@ sman , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for its denial a tax examination by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons electoral hel@@ per in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the publication of the presidential and Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s special consultant , to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before tax insp@@ ections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential did@@ did@@ acy of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already for@@ ce@@ able that his ref@@ us@@ al issues relating to assets , his donations for charitable organisations , his business bir@@ ths , and various other links , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already conc@@ elled on the subject and published on Friday a video on the internet , in the high @-@ level Republi@@ cans Tru@@ mp are calling for its tax statement . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she also talked about the topic at the economy of Michigan . &quot;
&quot; he refused to do what every other presidential did@@ did@@ acy has done in recent decades , and publish its tax evasion . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has no or only very little control over the 1990s , and an economic journalist of the New York Times announced a series of tax hav@@ n and tax advis@@ ors , the data that still may be the case . &quot;
German control have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a settlement which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ et that would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million make a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama supports the proposal too .
&quot; during an election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ et , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ekon@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate here has its headquarters , Tru@@ mp to a meeting in order to share their tax statements . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ et said he was just as a tax examination of the IR@@ S , and Tru@@ mp have been &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ tons campaign has published tax return to 2007 .
&quot; Clin@@ tons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , has paid an effective Federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40.@@ 5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax declaration of Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income is referred to as wage , unlike the majority of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; its main investment situation was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds are divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;

&quot; a French director of Jewish roots ent@@ angl@@ ed a media watch , after having betra@@ yed that Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel has no Israeli pres@@ election as it had requested the Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; sent his anger at Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann has tried Israel on the country @-@ op@@ tionally list of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries which can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a way to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
after a declaration the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; &quot; looked him , &quot; how Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel said that the measure is a &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
&quot; the reason that stood behind , it was even more anger in the director . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs , and they demanded that the pres@@ election will be deleted , the accused of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli Ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas @-@ trade sman called this a &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were kidn@@ apped by this event and trou@@ bled .
this is really very embarrassing .
&quot; the fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , even a greater shame . &quot;
this does not require explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the ministry . &quot;
the incident put a fairly large reson@@ ance on the internet in which people sc@@ anned the whole sc@@ andal .
&quot; some under@@ stated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have given the alleged enum@@ er@@ sion of arab@@ ic guests . &quot;
&quot; as@@ ham@@ ed to you , it was called in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the most beautiful Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all the accus@@ ations of themselves and called the incident , &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; with Lanz@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there has never been a direct statement , &quot; Israel not into the quick op@@ tionally list , &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
it adds that the country &apos;s choice has now been added .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT business
&quot; the abolition of sanctions grew according to Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading approach between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an annual comparison to 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest on these Russian companies grew strongly in shops in the country , shared the amb@@ assador . &quot;
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further trade @-@ construction is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
he mer@@ ged that the trading approach between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 at 7@@ 0.@@ 9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 increase and $ 8@@ 56 million amo@@ unted to .
Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amo@@ unted to $ 697 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the commercial swing was reached by deliveries of machines , land @-@ tools and weapons , &quot; said the amb@@ assador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year the Russian exports were around 35.@@ 000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , an Iranian citizen . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which affects the tourist places in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the recru@@ it@@ ant tourists in Russia will be broken by the last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the amb@@ assador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d that have received Monum@@ ents of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory as the British Team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the An@@ chor@@ age , who had made his Land@@ smann Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the job , and made the legend proud to come home to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ ri medals . &quot;
&quot; they reiter@@ ated the trick , after they took place in March at the railway championship in London despite the back @-@ leaving Ho@@ ys only one modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a execution .
Ho@@ ys retirement be@@ got a gap that K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man when they stayed when they saw potential in the vill@@ i that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y vict@@ orious - and Sk@@ inner continued in the qualifying rounds of an Olympi@@ ast@@ ek@@ ord , but in the stand@@ ings vict@@ orious the New Zealand in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; in addition after his round of round , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a great deal of transformation , in addition to the execution of a higher gear to dec@@ eler@@ ate it and allow Kenn@@ y and above all sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when it was on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing of comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make me a name .
we have set up a Olympi@@ ast@@ ek@@ ord in the final wound and defeated the World Champion .
it was incredible .
there is no better way to gain this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 on the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des gave Hin@@ des that he fell to the train after a weak start . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no one of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
in such an outstanding victory there was no such problem .
&quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; It feels with the whole GB Flags in the Tri@@ bun@@ es like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
&quot; we came so badly at so many world@@ ly , that it was amazing to win again at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the past five months that we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
&quot; with the form of passwords , it is in the area of the Pos@@ sible that he played a victory of three oly@@ mp@@ ic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would be born for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently hom@@ ely date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a result of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the cheese is the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int race today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels somewhat lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two other gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medalli@@ sts in the day , but there were more good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Br@@ adly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the Vi@@ erer @-@ four kilometers . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
&quot; the world @-@ ord , who won in London Gold in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins with certainty . &quot;
he had asked himself yesterday with a representative in front of the qualification as it smells to measure his body size .
&quot; in the appropriate woman &apos;s competition , tomorrow continues and ended , av@@ anci@@ ed Laura G@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in the world premi@@ er time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team leaves itself to domin@@ ate his strong rail team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick a sister to medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London have taken the expectations for Rio down .
&quot; it played Dr@@ amas in the background , so the resign@@ ation of the technical Leit@@ ner Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and har@@ ass@@ ment and retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite after that , the now legendary reputation of GB@@ s , which has reached its peak , again to be repeated again . &quot;
future of the mel@@ ting of Port@@ land because of lifting the energy consumption
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ ted land of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - are standing on the game , since the plant operator will termin@@ ate the energy contract , and thus all supply contracts will be up@@ lifted , as the provided energy @-@ owned companies . &quot;
&quot; this step followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to the operation of the system . &quot;
one for 20 years Sub@@ si@@ dy Sub@@ si@@ dy runs in November .
up to 2000 work@@ places in the complex of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land stand at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ ate effects since the mel@@ ting amounts approximately 10 per cent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry Sch@@ mel@@ sch@@ ei , which led the last year to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ked a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulations in terms of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the system for the system . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which includes the great aluminum mel@@ ting with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , distributed with that three other owners announce their contracts . &quot;

&quot; AG@@ L is assum@@ ing that the plant will continue to be operated in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting , divided the company with . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L still said that the contracts were called &quot; &quot; backup &quot; &quot; that would have to come into force from November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of cancellation , so that they will end for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from this , AG@@ L is assum@@ ing that the contracts will help in the financial year 17 to the revenue , &quot; said the current shipment . &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong termin@@ us markets for wholesale prices .
&quot; AG@@ L distributed with that it already wrote the value of the contracts already in its annual amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; expectation of a cancellation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to make the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... the ch@@ mel@@ ting to operate , or to ensure the power to the mel@@ ting &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company told that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year deal with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into force from November this year , even though it is still a statement guilty why it has resign@@ ed from the contract . &quot;
an@@ al@@ ysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closing of Port@@ land mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of analy@@ st in the start of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen , that Port@@ land uses approximately 600 Mega@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity . &quot;
&quot; should both plants disappear from the market , would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as power producers , that would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a car@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the sep@@ tum of the Vo@@ gue &quot;

&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand amb@@ assador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der is and ran on Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this co@@ vers to the wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the unvei@@ ling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , as well as in presence of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , how they forget the cover of their sister , and conclu@@ des with a classic turn : they all have a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the cl@@ oned action nearly every birthday calendar with a children of children ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; you found that we would have forgotten ? &quot; , &quot; with the honest@@ y of a cartoon by 8 am in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to participate their other girls somehow at this public@@ city . &quot;
with regard to the ur@@ gency of the Vo@@ gue has started security a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim likes them what the Vo@@ gue cover cover , be@@ aten ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen on April 2014 ) , but the cover of the sep@@ tum of the magazine is a League for itself . &quot;
the sep@@ tum is for Vo@@ gue most of the most popular issue of the year .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference , resem@@ bles rather an image @-@ band as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers to ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , from the 8@@ 32 pages of the Hob@@ bing 615 pages advertising ) . &quot;
&quot; the unvei@@ ling of his cover stars will be so longing that during the last two years , pictures of the magazine was still se@@ ated before the official announ@@ cements . &quot;
&quot; women who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ rities , the Model@@ n &quot; as &quot; Models , the celeb@@ rities &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ Award and Di@@ or @-@ brand amb@@ assador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low probability that Mrs. J@@ den@@ omin@@ ator - that is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; bru@@ tish model &quot; &quot; of their generation - under the past category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ rities are not related to popular people related or Reality Stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat @-@ Video ( although it &apos;s all on J@@ omin@@ ator ) .
they are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career . &quot;
&quot; of course , Jenn@@ ers do not like any success . &quot;
with its Reality TV history Jenn@@ ers was always something tense in the fashion world .
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ omin@@ ator and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called her &quot; &quot; Mist@@ pieces of the eye . &quot;
these feelings were back up again when the message with the show Jenn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut riding seems at the point forward .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ omin@@ ator is on the cover of the sep@@ tum of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your Grun@@ er of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all of her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sold from her mixed images of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the German magazine .
and in their spare time it is seen in the Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; congreg@@ ations , annually 16@@ 0.000 people &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the aid listed by the country are rejected annually by the municipal council centres , while the industry is defined on the effects of other medi@@ ations on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland it is already three of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , aid of need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ gi@@ ants and similar proceedings - in their request for free legal advice and legal advice . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , who are already over@@ ly out@@ dated , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , this legal centers will lose further 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot;
&quot; the director of the municipal office of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Federation of the community centers discovered that thousands of people were rejected every year . &quot;
&quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation could only be worse , without the lifting of the decision by the German government . &quot;
&quot; Queens@@ lands of the Municip@@ al centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave non @-@ violent relations , people with uns@@ ett@@ able and pressing debt , families that have been dismis@@ sed by divi@@ des , workers , the un@@ just way , and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government is cut down by 30 percent in June 2017 , which means that thousands of help people need to be forced out of Queensland with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the General Assembly and the judicial judicial system as well as Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these medi@@ ations promptly , so that people may need the help they need in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government filled its commitment to lift funds for justice to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to view the needs of the community centers and their customer community , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is investing in this important work . &quot;

this mer@@ ging re@@ representative surveys of the opinion @-@ based institutes IN@@ SA for the &quot; image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government approaches in the North is almost further ruled out , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have had good chances to continue the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD of 35,@@ 6 percent last five years ago on 24 percent . &quot;

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Zeit@@ l@@ upe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the successor is domin@@ ating today the world - its maker was living a disaster .
the device wei@@ g nearly a semi @-@ kil@@ og@@ ram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thick and larger , so it was not good at hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was pretty strange . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would reach today for about two sel@@ ections with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gig@@ abyte .
&quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the stores - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , lovers may still buy the devices on the internet , but they origin@@ ate somehow from the St@@ one@@ age of the dormit@@ ory . &quot;
20 years ago the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before on the &quot; &quot; C@@ eb@@ it &quot; &quot; office in Hannover as &quot; office in the West @-@ Bas@@ tion format . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to then standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax was the Communic@@ ator . &quot;
even the access to web pages was possible by HTML browser if also qu@@ ently slow .
&quot; a paper@@ back was available , a digit@@ alization book and a electronic cal@@ end@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; there was a small ant@@ enna , and the mobile phone could be kept similar to a laptop . &quot;
then you found a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphones in Germany was in 2015 at 3@@ 92 euros .
nobody could be in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator of the beginning of the smartphone era would become .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the cell @-@ card of the Finn@@ s lived an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
&quot; today , the market today master providers that were all much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere can be online , this is today for very many people everyday life . &quot;
2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
&quot; sold around 1,@@ 4 billion devices , on the Samsung and Apple de@@ parts of it alone 555 million pieces . &quot;
the global sales with the devices is about 400 billion euros .
these are the well @-@ running shops of the countless app provider and telecommunic@@ ation con@@ ium .
around the smartphone has been created in the meantime a whole industry .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs at the Mac @-@ World will introduce the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he said three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communications , everything via touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the winner of Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , which dominated the market , had the night &apos;s neighbour . &quot;
&quot; they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sc@@ ales now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after his invention is a matter of course .
&quot; in the inc@@ ision , each German now has 88 times a day to be on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to set all the smartphone , just told Jan@@ ina sphere , in the Siemens @-@ Board of Personal Information . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must channel the oly@@ mp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will not only bring home and prosperity only in our local communities but throughout the country .
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as at that time in London , when we operated a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and they will reach once again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies close to He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we are now able to create more than 10,000 new teachers , to create new jobs and prepare for youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of London in 2012 , it will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ ur us on the world stage .
the two @-@ fl@@ er had w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to dis@@ appearance , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked . &quot;
as the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ tional growth and to leave an understanding of skills and employment in both the airport and the whole of the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have been a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion of your infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T5 - the five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport enter@@ tain until T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented run@@ ners of the world . &quot;
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk that is supported by £ 16 billion in private investments .
the London &apos;s London Games were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we channel this oly@@ mp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row as well as our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; &quot; on display block &quot;
&quot; for companies that make money with online @-@ value money , according to one of the software manufacturing tests , indication block , a &quot; cat@@ ching and mouse game . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would not block the ad @-@ lock@@ ings on his desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ gger post , in which it communic@@ ates that users could update their filters in the program to re@@ block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday distributed Facebook with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the en@@ coding regarding its advertisements in order to show it display on which part of the page advertising is to complain . &quot;
&quot; however , Ad@@ block announced that there has been a new way to deal with the new codes . &quot;
&quot; in a blo@@ gger mail wrote the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle has been underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers , and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world @-@ largest company has been released for social media in the fight , is a strong indication that has become worrying for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study , according to a study conducted by Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people of ad lock@@ ers , almost four times as much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 15 billion daily active users , who access Facebook via their mobile devices , makes hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung 84 per cent of the advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has on desktop pc , as mobile ad block , there is no effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram divided into a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so that Facebook appears the investment of such a step as rewar@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday distributed Facebook with that it would be &quot; &quot; ad proo@@ fre@@ eing &quot; &quot; to have more control over their deliber@@ ate advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be worrying , because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the user , this is not a positive experience , so we are planning to address the problem , shared a speaker from Facebook in an email message . &quot;
&quot; Signs Set are a stupid means , which is why we concentrated on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman with suspected su@@ ic@@ ide on Swiss motorway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses even after a woman in the early hours on Thursday at a suspected su@@ ic@@ ide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman laid down in the Dark Ones in an act of desp@@ air , on the road and were taken by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a silence at the age of 49 years , one of several vehicles , including a car car , over@@ ride itself to kill . &quot;
she died still on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , the police that these as well as every witnesses of the incident come to sign up . &quot;
&quot; it was opened a investigation procedure , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , distributed G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avoidable ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ ut@@ or has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark Ones on the highway - was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a ped@@ est@@ rians runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
&quot; last year became a pol@@ ishing of the blo@@ c killing , after having passed a man and killed who was in August 2014 of one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had dr@@ unk , and has become unconscious on the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the Court stated that the pol@@ ishing -- which had responded to an emergency -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predic@@ table situation &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday , near Morges , should register at the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Climate : Venus was once inhabited .
the Venus was probably extinct according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms which resem@@ ble those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once had res@@ ett@@ led conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously noted that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their tight atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and nevertheless slowly move on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to host life and in front of a rapid devast@@ ation . &quot;
early Venus also prof@@ ited from a sun which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS Modell@@ simulation exp@@ ires the slow reverse @-@ up of Venus the sun almost two months long , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which seems like a rainbow , around the surface of a large part of solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures which are some degree cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model brought a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that has been projected by Plan@@ etary Research .
&quot; although it was probably inhabited , Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ zu@@ by much heat and ultr@@ avi@@ olet light . &quot;
their oceans distor@@ ted and its water v@@ ap@@ or was burned down from the ultr@@ avi@@ olet light .
&quot; as their Hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide did not go back to carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few works , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1,@@ 4 billion on expenditure on new projects in the North Sea will be expected to spend around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the stars of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler &apos;s space tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the star of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the stars are rotating to different r@@ ats , as well as in what connection the rotation periods with the Plan@@ etary development process . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we read through the compar@@ ing of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the Star@@ j@@ une of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light @-@ years away from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this constell@@ ation , which emerged above 125 million years ago , now reaching the adult . &quot;
they are now turning at the fastest .
at the peak season the gri@@ pping star breaks large amounts of star@@ ches .
&quot; since this win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star age , its rotation begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by taking the time between the show of an recognizable constell@@ ation -- like sun@@ spots .
the newest catalogue of rotation points out that more massive stars slower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ghts as smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ aden we see that slow rotation to be massive , whereas in@@ viol@@ in@@ ating faster rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star@@ ring of the Ple@@ j@@ ads is so close , it serves as the ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the Star@@ j@@ une of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , When , When and Why stars slo@@ wing their rotation rates and speak their &quot; dance gloves &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in three times reports in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Ple@@ j@@ aden reports that will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball @-@ Star occurs
the tears - with Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to base .
&quot; after his emotional returns announcement , the 41 years old pro will carry the Tampa Bay R@@ ays on August 12 against Tampa Bay R@@ ays a last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to the &quot; , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star Game Parti@@ cip@@ ants of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
his signature under a tenth year deal has been sent to him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contrast , on 31 December 2017 it acts as a consultant and youth coach - with full content . &quot;
as a player Rodri@@ guez has been paid for a long time with power .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) , and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ epers managed some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ Members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays , only two other bas@@ eball players only point in the most important statistics similar values . &quot;
&quot; but in the retirement of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old might not be recorded . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ guez - Nickname &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; - on the field was , as controversial is the appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star was taken at &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked up to the C@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for the 211 game . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be the main reason for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a dispute the sper@@ re was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 for 2014 , because I played a break for 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at that time . &quot;
even his far@@ ewell days do not go straight away .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bank . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a far@@ ewell tour .
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , estimated Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the actress Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson , sympathy of fans from Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Arch@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first sacrific@@ es . &quot;
&quot; wis@@ ely : because of a positive experience , weights may not start Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official sacrific@@ es .
a wis@@ er ath@@ l@@ ete would have won almost one medal .
&quot; in front of the seventh race , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ es became known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ing in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish weights were tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions , these messages come to the accident . &quot;
Ch@@ en has already been proven the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday which is used as a mas@@ ck@@ ier instrument for d@@ op@@ ing@@ sub@@ instances .
the International Sport &apos;s CAS confirmed her exp@@ ul@@ sion of the Olympic Games in the Friday morning .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds , they missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en could have to take part in the footh@@ ills of more than 50 m of free@@ ze . &quot;
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ trial at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association take the matter &quot; very seriously and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation in exam@@ inations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ Tribunal CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio sick@@ ened the message about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock &quot; , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it be inno@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to act with the substance offering the blood @-@ offering EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa was suspended provisional , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also be enjoyed positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w turned away with criticism to the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right battles , &quot; said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , some weight may not be allowed to participate in the chron@@ ically @-@ offering nation in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ eger in class until 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomas@@ z three days before positive on the early ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both indu@@ bit@@ ing the intake , both may not be started in the class until 94 kg . &quot;
before the start of Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ eten is especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF had allowed the complete Russian team up to an exception because of systematic D@@ op@@ ings to the start , also the L@@ äu@@ er Kenya produces in Rio numerous bad news . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming pool , the earlier release in China had also taken care of the athletes in China . &quot;
thus the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Sun Yang har@@ sch an .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of the open @-@ style , I want to pass , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t , in the French radio . &quot;
sun also stood at the center of a confrontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Sun was positively tested in the Chinese Championships on the stimul@@ ant of Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down a three month . &quot;
Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de com@@ presses its sol@@ vent @-@ eld
programmer from Er@@ press@@ ungs @-@ Mal@@ ware currently rely on targeted companies - and they are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of the mal@@ ware @-@ defense experts Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of the surv@@ ey@@ ed companies have at least once , partly several victims of an attack with Er@@ pres@@ ser software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of the companies were already target for a ran@@ som@@ ware de@@ be@@ zz@@ lement . &quot;
&quot; 40 percent of the victims were willing to use the sol@@ v@@ ents of the sol@@ v@@ ents , to re @-@ use the challenged systems and data . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their pres@@ pres@@ ser software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attack on attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; they are successful there , the potential ran@@ som increases significantly higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a fri@@ ghtening quick evolution of damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Male programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then discovered the perpet@@ r@@ ator software for himself .
&quot; only , private use were the target , but the change to company attacks was sc@@ ary quickly in recent months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of an op@@ fers active , she is looking for in@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as for archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als .
subsequently the software presents the demands of the pres@@ pres@@ ser .
&quot; to get the files to get the files , the victims need money - usually in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where private users can use the personal photo database on the game , the companies about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production tac@@ kl@@ ed . &quot;
accordingly higher the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
&quot; 22 percent of the affected people affected by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to completely dis@@ rupt the business , in one case men were in life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany many hospitals have already been victims of attack , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of n@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : pays not , you thereby only promotes the problem , &quot; explains Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of companies , who pay , get their data back again . &quot;
&quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpet@@ rators , given by stagn@@ ation . &quot;
the h@@ acker again know this and try to establish a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure has examined the user base and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to set up a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain to their victims by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites or de@@ code for example files . &quot;
&quot; and private men are rede@@ emed after payments of a few hundreds of euros , companies need to be partly hard to negotiate and five @-@ dig@@ it sums in order to rede@@ em their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ kl@@ ess gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware de@@ press@@ board , the h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share the work , explains Security Expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski from Anti@@ virus providers Sophos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; prob@@ able , however , is that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programmer sell their poll@@ ut@@ ants then in the form of a software design in the actual appearance .
&quot; the recent Mal@@ ware @-@ kits created by the mal@@ ware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; in delivery included is a custom@@ ary tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the pres@@ pres@@ ser look for another h@@ acker to spread the fresh software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log@@ ged in one of the forums in the underground , buying the set of a crime and asked another to install the software on the many PCs . &quot;
the payment is made per in@@ compati@@ bly calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on that Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful creation , the perpet@@ r@@ ator instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing &quot; , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this is the case of damages , depending on the type of data , much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rators will continue to take completely new goals on the internet of things . &quot;
on the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety researchers as they could get a thermo@@ stat under their control .
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a non @-@ aligned heating could certainly be a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ rators then instead of the heating in the future block a whole manufacturing street in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a subject in industry 4.0 . &quot;

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and ready @-@ to @-@ date
&quot; in the little HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ p@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform like the new Jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers both in the first row and in the F@@ ond lots of space , it affects no place close . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ upper side falls there anything . &quot;
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in storage .
&quot; it is not only a trunk area of 45@@ 3 l and 10@@ 26 l in common back @-@ up back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , when it sounds : the sitting areas of the back@@ bench can be found like kin@@ os@@ essel and thus offer storage space , which is up to the ceiling 1,@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk @-@ trunk can be easily loaded , but the loader @-@ height of 650 mm is slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l @-@ Diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges very powerful .
&quot; however , his work might be a little bit qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; welcome is the daily consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km . &quot;
there is another motor construction : a 1.5 l @-@ gas@@ oline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
a single @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a bit of direct .
the equipment is open in the tested top @-@ variant &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes open .
&quot; to the security systems belongs to the City @-@ Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ Assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ isions and the sp@@ ur@@ er assistant . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ isions sometimes irrit@@ ated , because he has been evaluated many obstacles as &quot; &quot; her@@ ann@@ u@@ ende objects . &quot; &quot;
very reliable works the remote assistant .
and the intelligent Tem@@ por@@ es respon@@ ds to the road detection and d@@ ros@@ selt when needed the speed .
&quot; but the full connectivity is available but only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are lying under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a little bit aw@@ k@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
&quot; who will not want to invest so much , receives the gas@@ oline starting from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 23@@ 000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 @-@ waste norm .

the r@@ ack@@ et had broken down in the fall of a knee sho@@ eing .

&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven the same symptoms . &quot;

&quot; this triumph , we will not treat the terrorists . &quot;
&quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country , but the safety and strength is also the approval of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère will achieve an implementation of the proposals until the German Bundestag .
&quot; he also announced another personal strengthening of security forces , and indeed &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ scale size order over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ etic for terrorism ever stand under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the weapon is quite as t@@ amper@@ ed that mainly the purchase of weapons on the Internet is complicated . &quot;
the last much discussed swe@@ at light for doctors should remain in accordance with de Ma@@ izi &apos;s words .
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the trouble @-@ tes@@ ters for solutions , such as the threat of citizens could be reduced , he said with regard to psych@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; to counter a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social care for necessary . &quot;

&quot; SPD Chef Gabriel said , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security . &quot;
it is important that the interior minister spoke clearly against action .
&quot; this was a ear for the hing@@ es in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke ME@@ DI@@ ENG@@ RU@@ P@@ PE ( Friday ) . &quot;

better traffic flow on the motorway exit
it is regularly on the reverse road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the legal system should be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all the car of travelers who stand in professional traffic on the ambient road every night in St@@ au , if they go through the motorway with Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the organization of road construction is extended by the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , in the area between the hammer road and the exit Wes@@ eler road the right down@@ right track at 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then turn right away from the hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is taking place early on which the total of that exp@@ ires on the versatile section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 is improved .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U group in the district of the representation of Münster @-@ West .
driving on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is annoying the mot@@ orists especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; week@@ days ranges from the back to bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ on path , and sometimes beyond that . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the needle @-@ cave on the B 51 short before the departure Wes@@ eler Straße . &quot;
&quot; from here , the traffic is only introduced over the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be re@@ constructed before a well @-@ thir@@ teen years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had results that the bridge has no longer the necessary capacity , in order to take part in particular the heavy @-@ duty cycle . &quot;
&quot; as long as this Eng@@ age and the associated market @-@ oriented St@@ au will last , the local authorities may not say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to reck@@ on : for the bridge has an official resi@@ dual period of time up to 2034 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal down@@ stream , the national scale has chosen the busi@@ est time in the school holidays because with disabilities to be reck@@ oned . &quot;
the traffic will take place on Tuesday and Wednesday at the job@@ site .
intercultural trip : cultural events for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the Association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
the Association N@@ ima &apos;s offers young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible Haus &quot; of the Young Theatre in Münster .
&quot; in the context of the association N@@ ima &apos;s initiated &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; , 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association has set the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , schools with welcome classes to visit in the framework of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people in the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and a little bit of German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the national pictures and video animations , it may have been possible to follow the action , so the press release of the Young The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; the Association of N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from Spr@@ akel , and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without flu@@ ids and migration background between 14 and 20 years receive the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , spectacle and music . &quot;
special offers for children and families in the@@ atri@@ cal and the@@ atri@@ cal language skills are in the planning .

rain instead of star@@ ving : hope of weather
the weather has made the ast@@ er@@ bs Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany at night to Friday a rod made by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad because of clouds and rain was bad to observe the heavenly spectacle , said the president of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good then we certainly see a lot of star@@ ches in the sky .
in the star @-@ doll@@ s it is Per@@ sei@@ den that belong with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest star@@ ches .

how do sleep problems or sleeping disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many different reasons for them , Hans @-@ Günter We@@ enburg , the member of the German Society for Schlaf@@ es and Sle@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; what one understands it , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , so one inhal@@ ation and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; just the sleep many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says J@@ ens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , Managing Director at the German Medical Hospital , with practice in the lower @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it , organic , psychological or sustained factors , but also drugs . &quot;
it is not sel@@ dom the in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early w@@ aking up is mainly in depression often , &quot; says We@@ ased . &quot;
and it can be that different factors thank each other .
&quot; for example , who has an band@@ aging case , can lie bad , wake up every two to three hours and you may need to greet about everyday problems and -@@ worry about all @-@ day problems and -@@ worry about all over everyday problems , we came across an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should you go to a doctor ?
&quot; who over a period of a month in at least three nights per week not well sleeps and the day is affected , should go to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; impair@@ ment can look very different : it is be@@ aten , tired , un@@ exploited , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ oods or bodily ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to rel@@ ieve the bed@@ time , it is important to find out the causes . &quot;
&quot; as a treatment options , among other things the behaviour changes , a cognitive behavi@@ oral therapy or also medicines - classical sle@@ eves only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - question . &quot;
&quot; in Germany there is hardly imagin@@ able in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of the Char@@ ité Univers@@ ität@@ smedi@@ zin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one should turn in sleeping problems at first to the house@@ surgeon . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied with exam@@ inations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should be in sleep laboratory and what happens there ?
&quot; for exam@@ ining in the bedroom laboratory medicinal products for example in snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory practices , with path@@ ogen @-@ fatigue or if one does not find the cause of a fl@@ ashes , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
one does not need to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only do not make a lunch , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after the cas@@ ing one goes to his normal time into the bed .
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des in the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap , and a f@@ üh@@ l on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera is characterized by the ceiling to the sleeping . &quot;
how can you get the problems get a grip on ?
there are quite a lot of plots where one can put a better sleep for a better sleep .
&quot; we@@ aved counts on : regular dormit@@ ory and asc@@ ents , not too long in bed , on the day not sleeping , not far away to sleep , alcohol , and at night do not begin to count on the watch , and that &apos;s not easy to calculate . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the D@@ SV &apos;s team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he had picked up gold in the first time in December 2014 and at the same time , he presented his first world record . &quot;
now the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ let Markus Dei@@ bler has turned his written ex @-@ team mates into the criticism of the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ let Markus Dei@@ bler via Facebook .
&quot; in a country where an Olympi@@ ad receives 20,000 € rewards and a jungle kö@@ nig 15@@ 0.000 € should nobody be surprised about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night on Friday at his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls is very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries which do not promote a lot , and do not see so exactly on the subject of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set out , &quot; &quot; said he further . &quot;
he wanted to start a com@@ eback that Dei@@ bler had already been reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is how you should keep it with countries .

airport : ban@@ de of baggage was arrested
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the airport of Düsseldorf
civil federation of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police failed to take place on Thursday the capture of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the Tat@@ ry had committed as a ban@@ de several T@@ ash@@ - and bag @-@ luggage .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30 , civil officials in the airport of Düsseldorf Düsseldorf announced a gang that was known from the polic@@ eman from past theft . &quot;
the two women and two men had committed several deliber@@ ations since mid July this year and were a collaborative and particularly professional .
&quot; the specialists of crime com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can indicate the slides , which were sh@@ ud@@ der to the desire of criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four acts of acts . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had a total of over 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few Lin@@ den@@ b@@ äum@@ chen , meanwhile a couple of Lin@@ den@@ b@@ äum@@ chen , the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in acts on the first sight not so , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; crossing the road from east to west , you will be passing on playing spaces , an fres@@ ort kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
to the fa@@ ç@@ ade of a gray house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; bo@@ ast .
&quot; opposite to a Li@@ dl , which is also going to be demol@@ ished , is already being built : until 2017 , a house is created with high windows and 133 new rental apartments . &quot;
&quot; article on this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; , &quot; as the responsible property company peaceful sha@@ w@@ al in the last few weeks , however , is preferred by burning cars in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the ground is the house with the number 94 : once was occupied by now , the residents of the lease , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; particularly the Berlin inter@@ sen@@ ator H@@ enk@@ el had spoken several times for a hard approach to police against the project , the area as &quot; no @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after the 22nd June the rooms have been on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , pat@@ rolled the police three weeks of official statements , according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams car on site , un@@ locked parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
currency of the renovated building workers on behalf of the un@@ familiar home owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later police and buil@@ ders under the rejo@@ icing of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the street is peaceful : parents go with children walking , people sitting on the side@@ walk before the houses in the sun , others enter@@ t@@ ained . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house@@ projects are a basic school and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens .
&quot; lef@@ tist authority is not the main characteristic of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which has been living in the pin@@ z since 1999 , and Jana * who are here three children mainly from the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the household projects , they share the concern of rising Mi@@ qu@@ ets and gen@@ entri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound according to a pine , which has had multiple police protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ zing left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , that of the Berlin inter@@ sen@@ ator and the police between land@@ lords and their neighbours , does not seem so obvious . &quot;
&quot; peaceful sha@@ h in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which is also today in comparison to the rest of the city a lower rate of average and high poverty sr@@ isi@@ ko . &quot;
&quot; also hous@@ ings and the new@@ born living projects have been occupied for a long time : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been evac@@ u@@ ated under great police officers in a regul@@ ators , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are partly inhabited by the people that they had occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district of the city has become increasingly becoming a mag@@ net for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world : with them , the inhabitants of the GDR and former land@@ lords were sharing their p@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; this also makes it remarkable in the rental , which has risen since 2009 by almost 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them on the dis@@ ks or fresh disp@@ uted fac@@ ades , which were raised with color . &quot;
&quot; no other street was mentioned so often together with the words &quot; &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason for that not all neighbours should be seen as a problem , that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes , such as physi@@ viol@@ ates are according to statistics according to polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most important part of the crimes make Non@@ fiction , the bi@@ zi@@ ell rather the re @-@ built and newly renovated houses meet . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence goes on , it is heter@@ ogen@@ eous : the people in 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not . &quot;
the famous burning cars also give it directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er for longer .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a crime burning , on the contrary , &quot; Here you are helping one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er street - and remained intact .
&quot; that is why it was also important that the inhabitants get their road back : from the police , politics and the media , who had suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the streets will continue to be taken away : by saving re@@ constructions in former buildings that push the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately property flats , which are not interesting for many here - there are more people who are not so well known , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I have absolutely no control . &quot;
&quot; but what should one do , if someone does not listen to someone ? &quot;
&quot; on all sides of frustration , also in the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for conc@@ essions , who would like to paint over colour bom@@ bs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the p@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; who draws , should be aware - just like someone who moves into a pub that can complain badly about noise . &quot;
&quot; all persons mentioned only with pre @-@ names have asked , not to be called by their proper name &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organisational management .
&quot; in addition , it is a social worker on the spot . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le the refugee camp for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ in supports the management of the administration of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees himself as a contact partner for all players : refugees , working planning refugee , administration , authorities and who else else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving wo@@ w@@ aking sh@@ iny , which above all has a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less sp@@ icy than on the multitude of desired areas are pur@@ pos@@ eful - meant when the administration wanted to write . &quot;
&quot; sear@@ ched for a administrative board with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an icy wo@@ w@@ aking w@@ aking . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; most of all , it is about organisation , work with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as network @-@ value . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ ors and full actors support . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon there are new containers in the Was@@ h road
&quot; it has been a serious problem for some time , apartments for connecting lights that have been recognized . &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
they need to put refugees in their own or registered residential spaces .
&quot; the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the countryside and to the Comm@@ une and J@@ ob@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time than very difficult .
de facto the management will not find private apartments .
&quot; so far , do not have to rely on private apartments , so d@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments must be managed as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers will soon be placed in the Was@@ h road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed lead , they are practic@@ able , training courses , training courses , One @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have found or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building or help house @-@ ma@@ stered , perform charitable work - and the motivated and very tidy as Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
they hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not mean to work .
the day need a fixed structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a prosp@@ erous feeling .
&quot; so , there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are r@@ ally .
so you also jump here administration and volunteers .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are appreciated in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can get the time useful , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; he eventually develop the feeling , he could not help in Ur@@ bach anyone who would not work and be un@@ sel@@ fish , who will never integrate . &quot;
the distinct majority is motivated .
&quot; but inci@@ dents there are also , says customer honest , &quot; people , where nothing goes &quot; . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always motiv@@ ate to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : did the two after recent preliminary results are afraid of radi@@ cal@@ isation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; what you can call na@@ ï@@ ve na@@ ï@@ ko and wants to exclu@@ de it . &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed the hel@@ pers are already .
these inci@@ dents may also be subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely in re@@ vocation .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , the main - and hon@@ orary capacity must keep in place and in the region according to activities . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they have always been in the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a ceiling ?
the question is clear to answer this question .
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put it hel@@ pers on the spot . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived , where we would go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , this would be able to relax . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher are already too ex@@ pi@@ red , to integrate with the previous people . &quot;
&quot; this is currently around 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but if people are in need , they are helping them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : Crus@@ her with helic@@ opter - wanted
the police @-@ helic@@ opter flew approximately one hour long different areas - un@@ successful .
two un@@ familiar men are penet@@ rated at the Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 pm on a flat in an apartment house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .

the ru@@ ff@@ le ran without success .
&quot; perhaps , the unknown before the apartment fell near the apartment or in their flight . &quot;
