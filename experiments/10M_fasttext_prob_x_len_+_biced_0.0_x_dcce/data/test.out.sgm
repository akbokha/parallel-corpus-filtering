<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policies in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential policy are in control and energy policy as well as in a basic question."</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference. "</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt more small and warns how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton would raise the economy to death and adjust to death he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself against it would be quite different, claims Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively return regulators, and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax evasion strong - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton against it says: the state has specific tasks to fulfill, he has disadvantaged chances and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the nuts, Trump and Clinton say almost exactly what is equal."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected about the state of the state of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so on Trump, there could be also partial internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">More evident are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-power plants and rebuild coal production in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil-funding should also be possible in so far-protected areas to terminate the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the contrary, with its Investment Programme explicitly wants to expand its renewable energies and calls for:" a country becomes the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the US do not want to isolate the U.S. from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">Those are to be paid even better for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hungry.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it on 15 dollars a hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be, then he says he could not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months would probably be likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics stand before him, so that the budget deficit would be even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, which at least want to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost already to everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany they are often traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen four women are sitting.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each has a baby, the most a year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has placed her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He gued with big eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother rigid on the top-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they notice that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">They smelt short and kissing the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is a member of Condrobs by Condrobs, a sponsor for Social Help offers in Bavaria, and deals with the subject of women on the escape."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are whispered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"they live in the Münchner north, in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs set up the furnishings together with Pro Familia and the Münchner's wife.</seg>
<seg id="18">Unfortunately she was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is an Wachmann in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here, has made their escape experience with sexual violence," says Bahr "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee for wars because they are persecuted, because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them as a hoppers to Europe," she tells them. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, other reasons for the escape:" many are secretly secretly, because they do not see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in her native homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced to see honorary wheat, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the escape goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tractor for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act, is not a rarity," says Bahr "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they were in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"again, all women in refugees would often be regarded as inferior and worsening if abused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to that about 90 percent of women who live in the residence in the Münchner north, appreciates them."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women were so usual there they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't like to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often do not help to help, there are more accommodations just for them, requests."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven districts governing the accommodation of refugees are responsible."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question, whether from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is such a thing that does not exist in accommodations of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Schwaben, women are not separated alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressesprecher of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in some communal accommodation units, undermining or private houses are available only for all women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the committee "rights of women and gender equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study that was published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are separated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy or men and women are missing together, it can come to - continuous - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"especially the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, stands in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel like this protection can be felt, it is possible to take place at the conjumped age, which there is to the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since itself has been around us that there is us, we have a long waiting time," says Bahr "</seg>

<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>

<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also spoke that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better to improve."</seg>

<seg id="16">"this was even bigger, because it was committed by a said friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetrust rebuild it again becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"months long, the nationally controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed to be the Turks for all the guilt."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most likely, the accusations of leading officials from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria could have benefited from the so-called Islamic state."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it is time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of Erdogan, which he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a ceasefire clearly lie on hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan takes first and foremost all friends, which he can get after the last month in a failed coup d'reich almost his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions did Turkey hit Turkey - especially the ban of charter excursions that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is reduced by nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">It count on a late attack on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>

<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulations it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West as its response to the tried to prove takeover as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the continued Groll come across the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pigeon that is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state of state in Ankara won a bonus that he called for the tried coup d support for the elected government bodies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a self-understanding of Moscow, which even has a profound fear of regiminary."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace made by the sea; it was Russia and Turkey, one as described as a analyst once described," Alliance of extrusion ": two countries, who encounter themselves from the West and feel poorly treated and are now verbal."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still differences between the two still great differences."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the largest difference in Syria, where Moscow has recently been playing the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposition parties."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be noted that after almost three hours of initial talks, both Presidents said at the press conference, that they could not have a call."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey forged it to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dispaster, as NATO member Turkey took the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least once again talk."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in future, the SPD and green: investors should be taken much stronger in the future."</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose almost 1300 apartments in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD suggests a" "action concept" "at the next meeting."</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD's Chairman of Christoph Bratmann says:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build urban areas in the future, must show 20 percent of all the apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the affordable housing can also occur in the stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the great dispute point in the city hall is however, so Bratmann:" how to deal with investors to build on private areas? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build such areas at least 10 per cent, but as 20 per cent of the apartments are building as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing structure, which will cost millions of costs and will be financed, should ensure incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, so Bratmann:" "there is currently no agreement between the groups."</seg>

<seg id="15">The Left wants even toughness for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of it, so Bratmann, a tightening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the scope of action is implemented, the system will ensure additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">"yet the program is not entirely different: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one compare the loss of further approximately 1300 apartments whose promotion will be running in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">It will be 500 apartments alone until the year 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, so the planned policy speaker, Nicole Palm, should now purchase orders from the city now."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, apartments would have to be thought to pick up apartments back to the pricing."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the West town.</seg>
<seg id="26">One fell swoop to the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the West stadt the yearly deadlines are running.</seg>
<seg id="28">"about 1800 apartments, one could get back to the price of price for cheap apartments."</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: these are the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"for the number of social housing in the West Town is dramatically increased dramatically, one is removed from the objective of so-called."</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of social weak in only a few districts should not give it any more.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens count that there will be even movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"presidents Holger Herlitschke says:" for a broad majority, the CDU must come to the boat. "</seg>

<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then on video games and finally limited to smartphones."</seg>

<seg id="7">"naturally I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that were created on the characters, which were first created for the video games in the 1990ern (later, resulting from a drawing series, game cards and other spinoffs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"how many phenomena of pop culture decreased the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Pokémon Go more users as Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>

<seg id="13">"a generation who played the game as she was still younger, closed to the wahn and sprang for the search of the sofa."</seg>

<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an App for Apple Watch, which followed the Washington Post recently, that within two days following the launch of the game, the number of subsequent people, each day 30 minutes train, by 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for performance tuning.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to bring about" "30 minutes of time" "and" "be active every day", "because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look like."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">"who regularly drives sports, reduces its chances to suffer from cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the wonderfull of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, making them fun."</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always there are also junctions, who must always complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"although Smartphone-Apps like FitBit could already follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British attack moved his immune system and spice reflex of a serious testing - by doing some of the narrowness and ekelest places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"moderator and travel gate Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk dots his course on the Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher, a tractor toilette and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in front of the check of each object, he used a Luminometer to show up and show us what it will be introduced."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment made under the title" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, the rinsing knob of a tractor, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely abrupt, but actually there are in a kitchen rinse more poor bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical specialists about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he woke up, more than a bad night's taste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestine by travelled through the world, and ate himself as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations to sinks of toilets, the task put his immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"he told me:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sammewater. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was justified his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the One of what it had, was a dirty public toilet in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="14">Its profoundries showed a Luminometerm of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometerms are freshly fresh and less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to detach after their Luminometerm over 4000 units was, while freshly paid hands a lot less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the bacterial number of different locations such as the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," This comes the worst, which I have in a toilet. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not complain about there because it is here inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company features Mr. Wright with Valio tubes that includes both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vuachmaa says:" we really wanted to offer the consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and simultaneously explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We carried crazy brainstormings caused by that we said "Lass to call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who introduced the director of the film, added:" "let me have lost me so - I could have lost my respect for Ian when he had caught some of the things that I have relieved to listen to him, just like the ekelous Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things where it was easier to bring Ian Gillan and others where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we have taken some of these dirty goodies to film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in one of the survey conducted by 2015, 84 per cent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 per cent told that they at least sometimes use products that included lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men middle age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you write to the commentary box to overlap him under the alias of non-agleemony men's age, with rust insults, this statement leads from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, it is not a boom of record, not at a boom in millennials that would like to greet the restiness of physical objects, but due to Midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all prediction after age 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it is also no horror by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older records, retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it, alone time (69% vs. 66%)."</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on television, I would follow the camera while in the midst of a business street in Soho, a humble grey attack and wild silicers before I steal, my hands hold and something decisive as:" so, let us take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let us take a look at that."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Sohos is slowly introduced to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now complete the buildings where independent seller were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman, to turn the camera to the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I followed by Sister Ray (databases: eight men's middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate", "he says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this record, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not responded to him at home), dress the walls of his room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: it is now able to buy records which he could not afford, when they appeared and once again to buy items that he sold, when he was young and plague."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late sixties, early 70s, which appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things, where I was probably some young to buy them," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend alone time, and add:" I don't smoke and I trunke not very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers who meet, which he meets the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has also noticed a new wave of people that are influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and to see again to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"of the conversations I have led, people usually have taken care of 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their plates, to buy CDs now sell their CDs to get back up their records," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the conical emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to recognize that record stores a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world, and want to withdraw to the stability of trusted sound-drives, from objects, the happy jugenderinnards."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it may be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is true with me as a collector and I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to get spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social worker!" "a staff of a record stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people, the last month have bought a record, they have not heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey found also found that 41% possess a turntable which they never use, while 7% of those who have one record, have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of news report, I would probably look very worried, while in a pile of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (databases: three men's middle age), has noticed a" trophy "of the revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone recently came here pure and said," I don't miss any record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record, so that I can put them into the shelf, "says he."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a large percentage, but it is definitely happening."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more produktlastic, less musiklastically."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older, which are only slow."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which is dedicated to the record of almost a whole floor, has an underground audience, when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women middle aged."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the most popular shops - Wild Beasts of synthesizer- and sexary pop instead of experimental Jazz dryers from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks sonically lonely, but nagging psychological traumas are difficult to determine if you stand in addition to someone 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes in the shop and regards the variation of the related plates."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window tame as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, so the collectors of plates is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from one computer or another way but the beauty of plates is... it drives with a lovable sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a shop, from which is said that a new generation of record owners should have inspired: urban outlet."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the note that Jeans-hotpants have to be courier, watching a group of young teenagers that grouped for a moment to buy Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter superior to buy a crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a stairwell, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, essential plates for average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody looks at her - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to engage them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record-art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items might mean more money for the sector, and some customers might send into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is not a surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, also the one that is most for luxuries such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research surveys found that the results of YouGov vote, let them, at least in turntables in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record-lovers, which exist in reality, plate and in Onlineforen, unconsidered."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the stroll through the plate of the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while the rigid look of an unfurtive, 30-year old moderator steer that over the shoulders nothing left middle age."</seg>

<seg id="3">"singing me - emotional and physically," describes it. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a sample they feel balanced, cheerful and overall lively, says it."</seg>
<seg id="5">"at the same time, they are doing something good at their health and mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because Singen is the same from several perspectives, a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior Bundesliga."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors singing in chorus and share with like-minded the joy in music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interiors can socialise social contacts and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">"we often solve social and family structures at the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in their choir:" "to speak and to organize themselves to another, and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being."</seg>
<seg id="11">"sing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">Because they are exercising a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Who regularly asks his lungs as well as in everyday life is not so fast out of the puste.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even though it is about getting the sound of voice in old age, Singen is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older men, Singen is often a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz by the Federal Association of senior senior organizations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, the joint Singen had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, explains it."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observed that the singing or hearing of songs in older people suffer many memories, often linked to positive emotions of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">Through Liedtexte and especially melodies themselves denied men deny people back to long left events.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head is also given a special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">"just older people who alone live, practice so, not just concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="23">A enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even the self-esteem grows through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show themselves: if I have long been for something, I will become better and watchful about me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to begin with singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he means, little talent to have, betrayed Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"one also sings not alone - with 50 sinful people who hears there, if a sound goes beside it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the suitable offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"sing someone from the acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply connect."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also provide overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">"who wants to sing in an ecclesiastic choir, can turn right to the church or the Church's Church."</seg>
<seg id="33">Many Senorenchchoirs can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"who does not have access to the internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's warm with dimples, could certainly have been sent among these known names that would be sent to Prime Time, which would be a swimmer, Turner or even Freal."</seg>

<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may last for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I might be modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>

<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a sublime enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never to end malls - but also the Grazie of the gymnasium, the two sports that combines two sports."</seg>

<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia, relying on violent resistance of the government. "</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig-protest during the clashes with the police have been killed in strikers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid union of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the past few months, protests against the government in the past few months have become more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people on the streets and slowed fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave witnesses that policemen shot in zig-armed protesters and töted.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in turn-well-being videos about the protests, probably from the last or early of this year, show how security men hit young people with sticks, while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN Office of Human Rights is now asking for a more detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country and in future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated land of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians along to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa when at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian Economy is expanding in considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new approach in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited, whereby Dispresidents are effective for silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many have been sent to exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian. "</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth are protest.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground use to the worms in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this zacked, controversial line demanded in June hundreds of life."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analyst fear that separatists such as the Oromo liberation front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden, who have been imposed in recent years more or less, the turmoil are useless and themselves to be armed again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years has now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with social media since cheap smartphones have become more frequent and improved the Internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are in regular intervals, does many people still communicate more about Internet proxies that hide where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave to the fact that they were gathered so on protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for the ons of prosperied the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, mainly Christian flood, in politics and economy, while they live the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in flat-regions."</seg>
<seg id="37">But that is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate on a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests found in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many of Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is invigorously dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which are around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in commerce and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr Meles, a former Rebels leader, was until his death at a non-publically established disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that it was especially sealed in it, early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officers to deal with opponents and make them unharmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively undetched reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of NordäEthiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray-controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia was experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands against elections protested according to the analyst, according to the analyst and were stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following sweeps many protesticks were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised the Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, as the new pendant move, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormalities of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month of attacked protesticks in gondar, a amharic city, by Tigray-guided shops and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming ever more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests the US and other Western allies can bring a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronentours across the neighboured Somalia, even though they recently rushed that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"during the West he clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want its allies in an already volatiful region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin digit migration."</seg>

<seg id="14">"at the end of July he moved strong criticism to himself, when he said, the Russians ought to hack Mrs. Clintons of emails, but later he said later."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic limits in politics and then return to their needs.</seg>

<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vage enough so that it can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>

<seg id="9">This long-shaped lifestyle seems to be a silver bullet for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science "at any rate of Greenland who could be 392 years old.</seg>

<seg id="14">"Grönland haie are hard to observe, eventually they live mainly in the ice sea before the skinny coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>

<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now examined 28 Grönland-haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Spitsbergen as a co-catch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, during the largest 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of animals, analyzes them with the carbon-14 method of the lens of sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eyebrow occurs already before the birth of sharks, which are contained in it later no longer redone."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest hatred had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lineup.</seg>
<seg id="25">"its birth should therefore lie according to the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons, greater amounts of this radiant carbon is discouraged in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in which with 220 centimeters in length of third animal, the Linsenker try a low excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland haie had in their lens against normal carbon-14 quantities which arises from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>

<seg id="29">"that Greenland females only then got descendants if they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers of the length could be assigned an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals had been determined with 392 centimeters on the threshold of the sex mature and his age was determined with 156 years, Grönland with the multiplication obviously was at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This might also be the case for spinal animals currently.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record holder, a 211 years old Greenland landed in whose bacon at the neck was a 120 years old harnessed head, was captured before Alaska."</seg>

<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of Elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>

<seg id="17">We have set up a Olympiastekord in the final wound and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to gain this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph of 2012 on the Kennys and Hoys, Hindes gave Hindes that he fell to the train after a weak start."</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no one of England's rivals.</seg>

<seg id="44">The GB team leaves itself to dominate his strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick a sister to medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London have taken the expectations for Rio down.</seg>
<seg id="46">"it played Dramas in the background, so the resignation of the technical Leitner Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and harassment and retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmer from Erpressungs-Malware currently rely on targeted companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of the malware-defense experts Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of the surveyed companies have at least once, partly several victims of an attack with Erpresser software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already target for a ransomware debezzlement."</seg>
<seg id="5">"40 percent of the victims were willing to use the solvents of the solvents, to re-use the challenged systems and data."</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their prespresser software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attack on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"they are successful there, the potential ransom increases significantly higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a frightening quick evolution of damage software," explains Malwarebytes-Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the Male programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then discovered the perpetrator software for himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only, private use were the target, but the change to company attacks was scary quickly in recent months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of an opfers active, she is looking for inlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as for archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently the software presents the demands of the prespresser.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the files to get the files, the victims need money - usually in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where private users can use the personal photo database on the game, the companies about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production tackled."</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly higher the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected people affected by ransomware, 13 per cent even had to completely disrupt the business, in one case men were in life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany many hospitals have already been victims of attack, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of nacts."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: pays not, you thereby only promotes the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of companies, who pay, get their data back again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators, given by stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again know this and try to establish a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure has examined the user base and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to set up a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain to their victims by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, freely accessible support sites or decode for example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and private men are redeemed after payments of a few hundreds of euros, companies need to be partly hard to negotiate and five-digit sums in order to redeem their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively riskless gains from the ransomware depressboard, the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains Security Expert Chester Wisniewski from Antivirus providers Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>

<seg id="5">The social pedagogin supports the management of the administration of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">"she sees himself as a contact partner for all players: refugees, working planning refugee, administration, authorities and who else else."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine customer from the working circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eiving wowaking shiny, which above all has a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"so, some - less spicy than on the multitude of desired areas are purposeful - meant when the administration wanted to write."</seg>
<seg id="9">"searched for a administrative board with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an icy wowaking waking."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"most of all, it is about organisation, work with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as network-value."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent place for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle honors and full actors support. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the Wash road</seg>
<seg id="17">"it has been a serious problem for some time, apartments for connecting lights that have been recognized."</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They need to put refugees in their own or registered residential spaces.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the countryside and to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time than very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the management will not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, do not have to rely on private apartments, so deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments must be managed as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will soon be placed in the Wash road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed lead, they are practicable, training courses, training courses, One-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have found or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building or help house-mastered, perform charitable work - and the motivated and very tidy as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">They hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean to work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer. "</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a prosperous feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so, there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rally.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you also jump here administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are appreciated in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can get the time useful, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"he eventually develop the feeling, he could not help in Urbach anyone who would not work and be unselfish, who will never integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but incidents there are also, says customer honest," people, where nothing goes "." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always motivate to motivate others. "</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: did the two after recent preliminary results are afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "says Regine customer quite clearly," what you can call naïve naïko and wants to exclude it. "</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized the helpers are already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents may also be subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely in revocation.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "says Regine Customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, the main - and honorary capacity must keep in place and in the region according to activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">"in doing so, they have always been in the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">The question is clear to answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put it helpers on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet arrived, where we would go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, this would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already too expired, to integrate with the previous people."</seg>
<seg id="63">"this is currently around 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but if people are in need, they are helping them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
