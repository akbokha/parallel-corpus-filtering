Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as to oppose Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abil@@ ising action in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is said to come about the conflict with the Palestinians and the popular two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been excited for years now .
Washington un@@ ra@@ cri@@ tici@@ zed the prolonged sett@@ ling of Israel and thro@@ ws a poor in peace process in the peace process .
&quot; by the Obama &apos;s promoted , the relationship between Obama &apos;s nuclear programme has deterior@@ ated the relationship of the two . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a contro@@ versy with the invitation of Republi@@ cans in front of the US Congress which was evaluated partly as an affair against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had refused it with regard to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in a not@@ ary , Professor , his friend were shot to have shot &quot;
&quot; in a not@@ ing , Professor Sh@@ annon was talking about a somewhat z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police , that he shot his girlfriend and that the officers must come to his house . &quot;
&quot; it was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of dead wife could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house did the officers of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a handful of notices that was done on a white sheet : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I fell , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to details of the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Jacob hosted in two online courses for the Delta State University in C@@ lev@@ eland , Mississippi , already 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot by the police into a popular history of histori@@ an , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ qu@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that the university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that he did not make the fatal emergency call at some point after that .
&quot; by the end of the day , there was a further death : lam@@ b took life , when the police took him . &quot;
&quot; during a day after the shooting at the university , the students and faculty are forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what was motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and collabor@@ ators , who knew him , they helped to draw a picture of an talented , but possibly tough teachers . &quot;
they said that they were looking forward to their lessons .
&quot; the police in the Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said , he has no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had been written by him written by his book in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; they were both sub@@ ordin@@ ated in the department of social sciences and history , whose educational bodies were 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ avers , the Lamb , he said , he also seemed a little excited and nervous , as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that lam@@ b told him that he had to do at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot;
&quot; in earlier , the Delta State University had asked for a ur@@ us@@ ement of health reasons and said that he may have some health problem . &quot;
this year he took only two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the employment Policy of the University meant that the promotion , for whom he had worked so hard , for him would represent no guarantee for an automatic route to a submission as Assistant Doctor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ K@@ ge said , he wis@@ er not of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
these are questions that were no longer able to answer this .
after the flight from the campus the police took a lam@@ bs when he came back in Mississippi from Ark@@ ansas .
&quot; before he was arrested , killed self @-@ treated with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber guns in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people that he lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 he began his work at the University , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and has under@@ lined geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he graduated in the spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs drew him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 , when they met through joint friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach the guitar playing . &quot;
at that time it was the women &apos;s warm .
&quot; all girls scre@@ ened , when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ ban of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the note called &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
they had a dog called light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick building which is adjacent to a ba@@ it in the Gau@@ ck .
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos; Ste@@ en , said they were left over 15 years ago , but friends stayed and a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos; Ste@@ en said he never met , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard he was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed both years ago on a summer break .
later they played together one or the other .
O &apos; Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse conducted for different companies online .
&quot; Mike Sh@@ af@@ fer , a Bar@@ ke@@ eper and sometimes enter@@ tain@@ ement coordin@@ ator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak lighted bar in the night of Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s ru@@ ined and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 September for the last time , after rup@@ ting his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ic@@ ant ended in front of a sp@@ ar audience . &quot;
there were no signs for anything that something cannot vote .
&quot; simply a lucky couple , &quot; said he . &quot;
we were at the au@@ fr@@ aming and jo@@ king with each other .
I mean ; they both had a good sense for joke .
&quot; Schmidt , the Dead Professor , led the first semester program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , Don All@@ an Mitchell , a English @-@ professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ansas and was president of his Br@@ otherhood and the Committee .

&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi River and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans have carried this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected , in order to conf@@ ess that the police now says that he was shot by the emergency , and that lam@@ b referred to his Not@@ ary Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication of that the two ever got married . &quot;

Michael J. Fox Super@@ kl@@ aces about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat at the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als and I notice that the seat is beside me empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simul@@ ated mo@@ wing and an ar@@ mes@@ an away from it , to be with the prin@@ cess of Wales on a Date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future &quot; , &quot; presented interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;

&quot; UN Chief says , there is no military solution in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ Moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s greater military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; for almost five years of lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN leader calls once again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to uni@@ fy and integr@@ ative negotiations on the Fin@@ ishing of a political solution . &quot;
&quot; said B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday , that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - U.S. , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the council meeting of the General Assembly even this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
it de@@ plor@@ es that the disp@@ arities in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; have to remain in@@ sol@@ uble .
&quot; B@@ an called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tackling the crisis in Syria , that they have demonstrated in achieving one nuclear war as Iran . &quot;
8 De@@ frag@@ ments that will show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ can try to move Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) does not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys , Donald Tru@@ mp showed in the double @-@ dig@@ it area , and some begin to wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
neither claims that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership has given guidance to the rising Herman C@@ ain , where none of them won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
there are many reasons why he would have in a general choice to fight .
but outside groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s ret@@ aining capacity and begin to let their dollars will flow to fall .
here are some current survey values which suggest that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s popularity levels have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in the middle of June , showed a survey of Mon@@ mouth University , that only two out of ten republi@@ cans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
until mid July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures continue in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa has found last week that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good idea of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as a candidate .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they would be either &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two out of ten say , they would be &quot; angry &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son gives about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the Favor@@ it of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Republi@@ cans sees the temper@@ ament of temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely cri@@ tici@@ zed for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and animated statements , believe 52 percent of the Irish Republi@@ cans of the Irish Society that the real temper@@ ament for a president , says ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is considered in the first op@@ tionally State of the nation , the state of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think , that he has the personality for an com@@ mander @-@ in , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his duty , and almost six of 10 still Independent - that his temper@@ ament is not into the White House p@@ asse , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if she exp@@ ose her schol@@ ar to hold Republi@@ can voters Tru@@ mp for real .
&quot; when they are asked who win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say according to a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C in the past week four of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
that is a change since then four out of ten late July their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters in the past did not have the cryst@@ alli@@ zed crystal ball .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans had revealed that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination to just 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Rom@@ ney . &quot;
nevertheless it shows that a variety of GO@@ P constitu@@ ents could see the campaign to be plau@@ si@@ bly .
&quot; even if the republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp be@@ ats almost everyone . &quot;
some experts suggest that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership while the Anti @-@ Tru@@ mp Support is being distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ use .
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp provide multiple assistance . &quot;
&quot; he has 12 points prior to Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , especially Walker 15 points , prior to Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before heading Paul , John Ka@@ ze and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald &apos;s Tru@@ mp @-@ fans says that they have formed their opinion .
&quot; a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T show that only slightly more than half of the voters , who support Tru@@ mp , say they have awarded their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change this , and no one can truly say , never change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said that they leave the door open to other candidates .
&quot; nonetheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ sider , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters that have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp on the subject of immigration .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp in his campaign was called by Donald Tru@@ mp in his campaign , two months ago from Mexico , &quot; Rap@@ ist &quot; , &quot; was the immigration and fishing point in the public discourse . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damaged the re @-@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but according to the new ABC / post survey , six of 10 Republi@@ cans tell us that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp on questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration laid down in the lim@@ elight , it will also do Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s seems to do . &quot;
the frustration of the government climb over new high@@ s .
&quot; by Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , there are about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly through their out@@ sider . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mont@@ ags in ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in Io@@ wa , two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated at 54 percent , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive living Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ w weg there is the most expensive living area - with a view of the North Sea .

&quot; on Sy@@ lt is the range of objects not limited , it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special places is one square meter most cost .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square for a student in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top places , one of the price is like Pe@@ anu@@ ts . &quot;
the Real Estate Group Engel &amp; League has published a ran@@ kings of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter high prices in fancy high places .
&quot; there are tens of ten thousand Euros - per square meter , so@@ othing . &quot;

by the way : Munich is not on the top priority here .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Traum@@ start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
two @-@ fold tor@@ scor@@ er in Piraeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller took just one course .
a lucky time of Thomas Müller @-@ blessed the FC Bayern the way to a conden@@ sed 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ re@@ aus - then ran .
a sovereign open@@ er of the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have described the FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ un by Piraeus a dream start into the &quot; mission Milan . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola won her pr@@ el@@ ude in the Champions League at the Greek record Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to gar@@ bage two pack ( 5@@ 02 / 90@@ th + 2 ) and i@@ dol ( 8@@ 9th ) and with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th class victory in series should be the first step towards the finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy where guar@@ ola will finally pick up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t after Munich in the third run .
Müller received some of the Champions League to the Champions League for Bavaria @-@ guidance from the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto which had to happen as a fl@@ anges of the world &apos;s master .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; had promised Bavaria , captain Philipp Lah@@ m in front of the game in the Car@@ ais@@ k@@ akis @-@ stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot@@ test fans - and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner had kept word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated vision with no to shine .
&quot; Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his most recent six home games in the Royal class , among them against major clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 proud here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els were defeated with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they were mu@@ cour@@ aged , but in their apparent efforts , but often too resour@@ ce@@ ful to work . &quot;
the attacks have been led to often by a shift on Link@@ sau@@ ces Douglas Costa , which rarely reached against the former Br@@ uns@@ wick Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller took more luck on the right than his fl@@ anges from the right half @-@ field in the left upper st@@ ain .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
initially , when the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown suggested the head@@ ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
then by direct check @-@ out the go@@ alie &apos;s Roberto with the knee ... 35@@ . ) .
although Bavaria were used to get un@@ domin@@ ating play could be Piraeus con@@ i@@ fers .
on Tor@@ ek@@ er Manuel Neu@@ er was Lost .
thus about as he became a kiss from ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 06 ) .
&quot; before New he left Guardi@@ ola a four @-@ circuit with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which did it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario i@@ dol , after mus@@ cular problems back in K@@ ader , sat there at first . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero have only given after the closing body green light , said sports pre@@ faced Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something else , that &apos;s just mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; while the first change , guar@@ ola decided against him when he made King@@ sl@@ ey Com@@ an for the com@@ promised Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; i@@ dol rose late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clear , with El@@ f@@ meters , Müller took another . &quot;
in front of the game it was in the stadium for Kra@@ w@@ alle .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly recorded Bavaria fans in their spect@@ ator block , the followers of hosts pirates were obviously prov@@ oked with words and ges@@ tures , the security forces took place and went with pit@@ ching against the Mün@@ ch@@ ner supporters . &quot;
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was in@@ ju@@ red from the stadium .
&quot; smoking , has a higher risk to lose teeth &quot;
&quot; who is smoking , thereby not only the lung , but also the teeth - that puts a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : when ren@@ unci@@ ation sin@@ ks the risk fast .
smokers have a clearly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this proceeds from the long @-@ term study of a international research team , among them a team member of the German Institute of Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to non @-@ smokers the risk of smokers did the risk to lose their teeth matur@@ ely , to get the 2,5@@ - up to 3,@@ 6 @-@ fold higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed over 23,@@ 300 participants .
&quot; major contribut@@ ors for tooth loss , c@@ aries and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ RE@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and dental loss typically go back to frequent rec@@ ess inflamm@@ ations in smokers .
not clear whether smoking is also increased the risk of dental c@@ aries .
&quot; people who c@@ eased to stop smoking , but could reduce risk but within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
&quot; it could however take over ten years until the haz@@ ard again to the level of non @-@ smokers , stated Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Diet@@ rich at the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; man must convince humans to convince non @-@ smokers , stated study manager H@@ ein Boeing of the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoke shor@@ tens the life time . &quot;
&quot; non smoking is good for lung and vessels , and results in good dental health as well as high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 have been affected by dental violence , the DI@@ RE@@ E with them . &quot;
previous investigations have already been noted that smoking is risk for early dental loss .
the new long @-@ term study is under@@ p@@ aired the findings .

&quot; they are supposed to come to equal amounts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
intended for the first time a second instance .
it would allow it to rise against Ur@@ als .
&quot; up to now , the process of procedures performed each other on arbitr@@ ator , an objection to their jud@@ g@@ ments did not exist . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fairness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it will go down according to its own information on an International Investment Court . &quot;
there could also be clari@@ fied there if disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
most of the non @-@ con@@ stric@@ ted investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) are considered to be one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against the TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ rators are cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel , to enforce the tax@@ pay@@ roll of tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ Inter@@ act reject the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
critic@@ ised the free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) for the already negotiated free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic @-@ secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) performed the plans on the other hand as a major progress .
&quot; the Commission considered significant points in the reform of the federal economic Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel , in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
also the French government greeted the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Business Association Busin@@ ess@@ Europe war@@ ned that the economy pret@@ ations of the economy has to limit its way to a number of new rules .
especially small and medium enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged through it .
when the talks about the free trade agreements TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded on Wednesday .
the negotiations are run since the middle of 2013 .
investor protection topic has not been discussed with the USA .
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be un@@ sustainable .

eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens stood on stage at the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; next to him , there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which has recorded the after@@ sho@@ ve of the picturesque US state of Michigan with and pen . &quot;
&quot; the total audience , about 40 persons , is almost made of St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells of different places he ever recorded on the map , what he writes about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ous and tender songs . &quot;
where they came up and how it looks there in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative res@@ ellers .
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ ens from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear s@@ smart compos@@ ered songs , which nest@@ les harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time it &apos;s great to dri@@ zz@@ led . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ ors , &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a gone series : each of the 50 U.S. federal states should be in a row . &quot;
&quot; however , in 2004 and in Rhin@@ o @-@ proximity , already &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already been released , and has a positive anticip@@ ation . &quot;

&quot; although there are now nearly 2000 guests to sit in their chairs , the clearly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns back to intimacy and to the folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician with the broad @-@ enriched album . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the ques@@ tioning of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has expected to anticip@@ ate the ques@@ tioning of the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour President Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n shall give his debut in the ques@@ tioning of the Prime Minister for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of its six pre @-@ given questions shortly after noon , whereby his performance from the media probably will be insp@@ ected by the Labour MEPs . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p several meetings to aband@@ on her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , for it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow hut and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime the decision of the Labour Council , held on Tuesday during the singing season at a commemor@@ ative ceremony to the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence to be praised , critic@@ ised by a number of T@@ ory priests in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Decision not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne has attracted attention
&quot; a narr@@ ator by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , he would have been &quot; &quot; respectful of silence &quot; &quot; and he accepted the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news programme , he got to sing the Labour leaders to sing the National hy@@ m@@ ne , &quot; independently &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of the shadows of the ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they refer to differences in economy , defense and foreign affairs , while less than a Six@@ th of the Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also for@@ kli@@ fts within the Labour authorities &apos; and Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos; statements on the position towards the European Union and the limitation of winn@@ ings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour has put forward the whole idea of limiting the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith said Mr Smith , the shadow of work and pensions ministers that the party is &apos; very clear &apos; that it is only against the government plans , the limitation of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ to lower . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the 5th Labour leader who David Cameron , since he has been t@@ ory Chief , has since stood over the Dis@@ patch &apos;s box over the last decade . &quot;
&quot; the Labour President , who promised a different political approach , says that he has given &quot; &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has told that the ques@@ tioning of the Prime Minister has to be con@@ front@@ ational , and that he has made both &quot; &quot; stroke &quot; &quot; and the dispute with re@@ ho@@ oks , and instead have done to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle is represented by the shadows of an office if he is not participating - for example when Mr Cameron is on the way .
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he said John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the sub@@ house , addressed to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said that he is linked to the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; , &quot; who is often associated with the ques@@ tioning of the Prime Minister . but some years later he was se@@ ated in it . &quot;
&quot; since they were first aired in 1990 on television , the issues was argu@@ ed with the Prime Minister as the more important bar@@ ometer of the native of a leader and his leadership in his MPs , although critics argue that they became a caric@@ ature and would have extensive reforms . &quot;

pounds increases to accelerated up@@ growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pounds increased according to data , which will display an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was raised by the don@@ key goal SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
between May and July the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew to 2.9 % compared to the same year @-@ earlier period .
this percentage was the fastest and tested over@@ estimates regarding the time of an interest in 2009 .
&quot; the Po@@ unds rose by more than 1 % against the dollar on $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was up to 1 % over the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 index concluded with an increase of remaining % on 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
&quot; SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % , after taking over the ri@@ vals of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v . &quot;
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and put it together as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were looking for encouraging messages from the competition for luxury goods ( emont 0.3 % higher ) .
&quot; Rich@@ em@@ on@@ &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations , and also showed that sales in China - a key market for bur@@ berry - boo@@ sted growth . &quot;
&quot; shares of Glen@@ core en@@ closures by 5 % , after the mining authorities said that he did 2.5 billion $ through a stock exchange as part of its strategy of debt recovery . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers in the index , and with a decline by 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estimate for the company ratings . &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports increased by 3.7 % , after the first half of the year , a pre @-@ tax result of 46,@@ 6 million had already been reported . &quot;
the boss of J@@ D Sports is saying that higher wages is end@@ anger .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; would mean more sales in the po@@ ckets of the potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this merch@@ ant would pay the higher labour costs at his firm , says he . &quot;
&quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , added , and this might mean there are less extra jobs . &quot;

met@@ cash laun@@ ches ground @-@ dig@@ ging campaign to fight Al@@ th@@ - In@@ case
met@@ cash tries to protect Ig@@ A stores in front of an al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ down campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A ret@@ ailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of an 700 million US invasion .
&quot; during Al@@ di the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ Super@@ markets for relations with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ dealer and suppliers jump on board , using brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ borough that is distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops samples and shop @-@ owner , the discounted tickets for the South Australian German @-@ liga to faithful customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will release further details of its defence strategy on 29 September , when the wholesale distributor plate for food , alcohol and devices made its annual investor strategy . &quot;
there is much on the game because South Australia and Western Australia nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ shop@@ per rolls and higher profits than Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ network in the East states .
&quot; both South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to around 14 percent in the east states . &quot;
&quot; however , analy@@ st like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market will cut off on all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to the report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A @-@ retailers 360 million sales per year and Met@@ cash will lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this progn@@ osis depends on the assumption that Al@@ di opens in the next year 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA , and achieved sales of 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and groc@@ eries and with the amounts on Met@@ cas@@ hs high fixed cost basis , Met@@ cash could cost around 13 million earnings before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , met@@ cash market shares in the east states , mainly of Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan that Ig@@ A @-@ purchases the most faithful ones . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ cas@@ us turnover growth in the food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2017 and 2.3 percent in 2018 it will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business eat in Melbourne , that met@@ cash probably will disappear inside a decade . met@@ cash will disappear . &quot;
met@@ cash regi@@ es to respond public to the comments made by Mr Dou@@ glass .
&quot; however , it is assumed that a member of Met@@ cash came in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ As &apos;s market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ cas@@ hs nutritional and grocery store , which has fallen around 43 percent since 2012 , refl@@ ecting the operating debt construction at simultaneous pressure on sales and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; however , wholes@@ alers surplus exists and inv@@ ests more than 150 million euros to provide sales prices with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ s@@ ths by hundreds of products every week and Ig@@ A retailers in improving their stores by fast growing fresh food and provide a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ cas@@ us &apos;s principal secretary Ian Mor@@ rice says that the pricing and charging programmes are expected to lie on z@@ apping and hopes that the wholesale distributor in 2017 for the first time in four years will return to winning growth again . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ als &quot; within the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves more praise than criticism for his own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger and talented du@@ os , which is always described as a special K@@ yr@@ in , with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ ack with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ inka , at the Montreal Masters in the lim@@ elight . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon thereafter , Kok@@ kin@@ akis had to be separated and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison , and I should hit the child . &quot;
&quot; while he recently was seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a c@@ amp@@ f struck a potential US @-@ open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was defended by Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in order to be the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I keep myself cra@@ ving , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the dispute . &quot; &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et when he lost because of a wre@@ ck in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken up a r@@ ack@@ et with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of that . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has grown extremely well in the US Open , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he earned lots of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around you , and I believe he was a little treat . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never worked out a problem with the other players , he trained hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stur@@ dy and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; Heal@@ y also supported the decision to take into account K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os during the important decisions which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; as the right for all , but he saves the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term firm feature into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the contro@@ versy round &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; and I believe Nick has made that Ascension , what people like spring and Murray has made him and deserves all the cri@@ tique that he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions understandable . some time outside the ram@@ p , where he can only think about it , and it is best for the team and it &apos;s best for him . &quot;
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary declares Emer@@ gency close to the border with refugees
&quot; Hungary explaining the emergency , and put the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept all firmly trying to get illeg@@ ally coming into the country . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed at the border , when hundreds of migrants accumulated in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Ser@@ bian officials with rebellion . &quot;
&quot; the people who had escaped from violence , st@@ ained for a unknown time in a landing on the street between the two check@@ points of the countries and built up tents and settled there . &quot;
but Fru@@ it sti@@ egen .
&quot; as a police helic@@ opter on them moved , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and scre@@ ened the border ! &quot; and scre@@ aming ins@@ ults against the Hungarian government police . &quot;
some made of protest to food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister explained : &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece would arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a collector &apos;s harm .
&quot; there must be held talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence in the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ bian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nations @-@ block in Brussels at a tense meeting in Brussels .
&quot; the ministers agreed , however , to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who would vote in the shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be agreed that the EU states would receive further 120@@ .000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday for an extraordinary summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary didn &apos;t put his hopes for a bal@@ ancing promotion of Brussels or of its neighbours .
&quot; the emergency emergency situation in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could accelerate streets and seek asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country was also planning to build a go@@ z@@ wir@@ ing along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after having finished a fence at the Ser@@ bian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison @-@ races of the competition , to create the bar@@ bed @-@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; over the past few months , Hungary has become for many war resist@@ ances in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East for a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and entry into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , President Viktor Or@@ ban , however , has passed that most of the upcoming economic migrants are looking for a better life , and non @-@ war migrants are entitled to protection - a view that stands strongly in contradiction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws which occurred about midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damaged of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ uns , which left the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws lay even higher pen@@ alties for def@@ endant bonds . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation that emerged through the mass migration , the Hungarian Government introduces the emergency rule , &quot; said Govern@@ ors z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ a. re@@ por@@ ters in the southern town of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the parliament must still agree with the deployment of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ por@@ ter of Associ@@ ated Press reported on the border of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Bak@@ on@@ di Bak@@ on@@ di , country &apos;s security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across , sh@@ ame@@ ful by the fence , they are now in police and are accused of the desire of crimes , according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities need to fix the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials joined two of the seven border suns@@ ets with Serbia , after a train station wagon with bar@@ bed @-@ wire , in order to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos conver@@ ts the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and thr@@ ust the crowds to get up there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to come in , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important Autobahn connection from Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse to travel to Hungary until they would like to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons pres@@ ion before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
&quot; the former Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton is still holding a double @-@ dig@@ it head start in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported the support of 47 percent of democratic voters on the pres@@ election ( 58 % before ) , while S@@ anders will be second , 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice @-@ Chairman Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet proclaimed whether he resign@@ ed for the presidential office , receive support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the pre @-@ elections , say most democratic voters that it is too early to say that their opinion will stand what candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons supports supporters in their choice of more proof than that of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while in the past some profits achieved . &quot;
Clinton is holding a big advancement in women and moder@@ ates but these pro@@ tri@@ angles have reduced .
&quot; their support in the men has fallen mark@@ edly , and differently is here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons benefit for democratic voters under 50 years of age has grown rapidly , and it is now on the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big advancement in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton had a double lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections , say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the Party . &quot;
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the nomin@@ ee .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters can mainly be char@@ med by her .
the views are stronger by those who currently not support Clinton - just about a quarter would love it .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections say that Clinton support him with enthusiasm , say no less Republi@@ can voters decide about their peak performances by Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ tons supports you in an open question why they want them to be the most common response , is the most common response that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that a woman &apos;s president ( 13 percent ) and that they are the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
this is also mentioned by Clin@@ tons &apos;s support with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to the handling of the problems and the voters are also quoted .
&quot; as the Vice President thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office in the scale area , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes it should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for the presidential elections , who would be their second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
&quot; of Clin@@ tons trailer are saying more than half , that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far before S@@ ander . &quot;
&quot; decides in favour , not for the nom@@ ination of Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons pres@@ ion against S@@ anders , of 20 points with ben@@ ding in competition on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election ; however , this figure of 78 percent in the last month has fallen . &quot;
&quot; ben@@ ding is by far a second part of this measurement , but the percentage of which sees it as the &quot; &quot; voting &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; however , with the question of what is more important during a candidate , critic@@ ise voters questions about voters . &quot;
&quot; similarly as last month , no single principle of the candidate or potential candidate for this voters of the elections are unacceptable as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates succeed good results in some important features for voters of the presidential election of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities are looking at Clinton , S@@ anders and be@@ ers as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong guidance . &quot;
&quot; bi @-@ cuts with the three candidates best in honest@@ y , while Clin@@ tons of strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion from him . &quot;
democratic voters of the pres@@ election in general also Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ological ideological in accordance with their views . &quot;
with all these measurements such a quarter of democratic voters never think of S@@ anders .
&quot; since questions to Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons of use of a personal email address and a server during the term of office as a foreign affairs , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their statement and say that their opinions were not overall influenced by their opinions . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their declaration while only about one third is satisfied .
&quot; public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the issue of light came , split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans had said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no effect on their general opinions by Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has still deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six out of 10 , which have said their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters altogether : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the elec@@ torate not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the elec@@ torate has also seen Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp are good music under guidance .
&quot; from the six tried candidates make Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best on honest@@ y . &quot;
&quot; a majority of things seem different to be honest , but as with Car@@ son many do not have any opinion from him . &quot;
the bug@@ ging rate for the sampling of 351 Democratic voters with the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves on a survey near Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is one of the latest articles from C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; in the meantime the two candidates themselves killed half of the voters in the new pol@@ l , and others lose out dramatically . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue supporting Tru@@ mp in great numbers . the support grows of 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted in the Fox News debate last month to be 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son &apos;s lap in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey was also revealed that Car@@ son meets demo@@ graphi@@ cally groups and meets the Tru@@ mp under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ ze , has fallen apart with Wis@@ con@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen at the deepest and ten % supporting last month at now 2 % . &quot;
the former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush ; former Gover@@ nor of Ark@@ ansas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % in the third place .
the trou@@ bles@@ hooting at the sampling of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was done in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week shows that Car@@ son has been increasing in the surveys - he lands around 19 % support in the republi@@ cans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed the Tru@@ mp clearly prior to Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view of one over the last week , Tru@@ mp found some page hi@@ des for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son exc@@ used to question Tru@@ mp@@ s faith in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a meeting at Io@@ wa . &quot;
pleasant bathing @-@ temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak value are measured only in the distance , ranges for bathrooms already a trip to the Mediterranean to find even more warm water . &quot;
a bathroom in north or Baltic is likely to be a short walk at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some more people go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees , the water is in the north and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the Deutsche Wetter@@ dienst ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; bathing @-@ temperatures still offers the Mediterranean Sea : in the East , it even comes up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is located at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Con@@ frat@@ ernity leave the death of a Bar@@ ker College
&quot; nearly two years after a student during a schi@@ kan@@ oid ritual , during a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an@@ alogue will be submitted against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York &apos;s Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Br@@ otherhood takes part in the hospital in September 2013 and consumed his transportation to hospital , which has contributed to his death , shared the police with him . &quot;
&quot; officials spoke that he had been bur@@ dened with their eyes with a 30 @-@ pound ru@@ cks@@ ack with full of sand , and repeatedly sh@@ aded , while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g retired finally about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ si Br@@ otherhood does not write the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited a lesson before they took him in a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms of goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Br@@ otherhood to contact advice , said Mr. Poli@@ signed Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , members , U@@ ten@@ si@@ lia began to hide and set the well @-@ being of the Br@@ otherhood princip@@ ally by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ v@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died the next morning to his wo@@ unds .
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ ot@@ eric , Den@@ g has been repeated with st@@ amped power injury to head , trunk and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the chic@@ ane of the Br@@ otherhood . at least a student dies since 1970 every year at the chic@@ ks , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer of the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended indic@@ t@@ ment due to murder of the third ridge for the first five members .
&quot; two @-@ thirty members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with severe attack and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to take responsibility for the persons involved , but if there is an organization , which - officially or in@@ official - this is , we shall also hold it to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ ker College has forbidden the Br@@ otherhood , and the national co @-@ otherhood has resist@@ ed its affili@@ ation to the group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increased interest rates
&quot; interests arrives , and the pet is falling into the rech@@ arge , return for bonds will rise , and the economy will gli@@ de into recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides only little instructions on the procedure . &quot;
&quot; a recession came within just 11 months following the initial rate of interest , and it lasted for 86 months . &quot;
&quot; the aggression of the Federal Reserve on raising the interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investment will respond . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the time period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
in fact several variables play a role .
&quot; in the end , market participants could find that all excitement because of a Zin@@ ca@@ vities might be exagger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inev@@ itably interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; endor@@ sement , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still too a lower level to lead to sei@@ sm@@ ic shock , which many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no impact . &quot;
&quot; here , one of the historical trends @-@ based perspective is how some areas of the economy might react to : &quot;
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the prejudi@@ ces of interests may make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ l . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase hits , the influence is not that dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that wealth needs 12 to 24 months after the first increase will be stimul@@ ated , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ st in a newer study to what happens after Zin@@ ca@@ vities of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in the past 35 years , the market in the last 35 days ( average profits of 2,@@ 6 per cent ) , then back for normal yield in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , then back to normal analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , CEO plant strategy in Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , in Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the expansion lif@@ ec@@ ycle and returns this result .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interests them often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not exist before and could accelerate a recession . &quot;
&quot; extremely remarkable is this , that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in an interests of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 clim@@ ates since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3,@@ 6 percent , just few that this is going to last and expect the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; interests in a so fragile economic scenery could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have taken the whole year on an interests of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many sh@@ at@@ oms and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could mi@@ tig@@ ate an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading is only a chance of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the increasing cycles of 1950 to this day have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and in pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists very fast after the start of recreation in the shadows &quot; , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what is the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which has been waiting for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are now 74 months . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market is a Zin@@ ca@@ vities , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than when compared to shares , when changing its strategic course . &quot;
bonds also appear to change the direction once the first increase in lowering into the cycle is done .
&quot; at the end of the repair cycle , the bond @-@ stri@@ ps fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Str@@ at@@ egen of Charles Schw@@ ab believing that the increase in the interest rates will result in bringing the gap between longer and shorter attacks , and lead to a de@@ fl@@ ess of the curve . &quot;
&quot; bonds often bring better y@@ ields in such a climate although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come Analy@@ st in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting is , says Jones that the markets already have adapted to F@@ ed Strategy . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield higher is flat , credit and vol@@ ati@@ lity has risen and the vol@@ ati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , companies will benefit from the greater part of their operations in the US , when interest rates are rising and local products more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multination@@ als with high debts will be worse , since a rising dollar turns their products on the global market and also the financing of their debts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality - &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interests of interests , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ analy@@ st in a report for the customer . &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with growth rate after each of the Zin@@ ca@@ vities in 1994 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points .
&quot; companies with high capital yield and low vol@@ ati@@ lity , in their stocks also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) . &quot;
debts will be a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure share , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollars . &quot;
&quot; saving you could see profits due to higher y@@ ields , even if experts of different opinion are , how quickly it will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM Community as Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary Andrew Bin@@ gham
the Conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament cri@@ tici@@ zed the radio station because of its &quot; distor@@ tion &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly different from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said that they were only The Br@@ its im@@ it@@ ated
EP @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins took the show The Voice and said this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts to Classic FM , said a leading German member and raises the new print on the channel , to prove that he does not do anything that does not do the &quot; &quot; private sen@@ ders &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ atives MEP Andrew Bin@@ gham was also alleged to have the BBC bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ sy &quot; ver@@ dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and increasingly not differ from its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I am not using the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; but it seems to transform herself to Classic FM &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also summ@@ ed up at the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , The Br@@ its seem to be just under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr Bin@@ gham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ Direc@@ torate General took back the accus@@ ations , and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far from its commercial ri@@ vals , when it comes to live music and raising public . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I consider it really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that will be tough@@ er to work harder than it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport led by fire to step the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins handle The Voice at - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for a cost of 22 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinctive ? &quot;
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - &quot; was produced in special BBC fashion .
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; hit a hit from our house @-@ own barn , &quot; &quot; if the next time there are a fun series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or give money to pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet transform@@ ations lasted in August on the slow and the Black Friday it can be responsible for it .
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
in the last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the record in 2000
online purchases are reinforced three years ago by using mobile phones to shop
experts believe that Black Friday has slo@@ wed the expenses on Friday in November .
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual mall has geb@@ o@@ om@@ t , and many of the Great Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have transformed itself in gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are now signs that online rates are stag@@ nat@@ ing after new figures revealed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure on August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase in comparison to the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs that online sales will stagn@@ ate after new figures have only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , then it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ Shop into the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online purchases took over three years ago , as a vend@@ or , with their mobil@@ es purchases . &quot;
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments such as at home on the sofa .
&quot; but now comm@@ utes , and we may experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday @-@ phenomenon which was imported from America is c@@ ited as a reason for the following det@@ ectors .
&quot; experts believe that buyers have their purchases in front of this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers around their computers turn to make their be@@ aks , and some ret@@ ailer sites over@@ threw . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers are fighting against bar@@ gain control , buyers of them could hold them shopping . &quot;
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium took a bit more than 1 £ posted on a £ £ expenditure .
&quot; with some products such as television and wash@@ ers , more than one third of the shopping can now be done through web @-@ shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than one quarter of the people are bought clothes and shoes online rather than in the deposits in the interior . &quot;

Saudi officers have already confirmed that H@@ add@@ sch after Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group would not have understood the arm of the Crane , than he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decre@@ e , which was released by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group was responsible for collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the leadership of the business will not be prohibited . &quot;

&quot; Véronique Lau@@ ry , a new director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Bau@@ ma chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe , who offer services to deep praise is now out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 further screw @-@ fix shops , which set up to craftsmen and 60 sales points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions on a shop will be made by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the men prevail over the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we must move this stronger to a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers account for women with 80 percent of decisions regarding the purchase of items by women . &quot;
women play a big role in decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed as well as their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and financial officer . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our boards .
King@@ fis@@ her announces a decrease in the half @-@ year price and the ou@@ tre@@ aches after the group charges the cost of the in@@ ference of the stores .

functions of A@@ ich / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before judgment
at the State Court Kl@@ agen@@ furt have arrived on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball court A@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and rep@@ airing trade union .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with am@@ eke@@ eping missions .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he has been partially extinct in May of law . &quot;
the present process has been postp@@ oned .
&quot; according to Upper @-@ state Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed out in the preliminary examination , that the accused in the years 2006 until 2011 funds from society accounts , over which they are dispos@@ ed in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage was projected with around 400,000 Euros . &quot;
the spor@@ aries are also charged with financial statement .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; to the off@@ end of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense of that association was not ar@@ isen in a document at any time . &quot;
&quot; the Sport@@ sman would have had only conc@@ er@@ ated on the sports club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they would have invested a lot of time and money , from debt to € 60@@ 0.000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : do we keep the club continuing or un@@ lock ourselves ? &quot; , &quot; told one of the accused , in the ro@@ ot@@ al wholesale aud@@ itor of the financial am@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take on this task . &quot;
with all the risks .
&quot; we have prescribed money , our life insurance acts as a safety at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said at the acceptance . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , there may only be no public debt . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in corresponding financial - success , the payout of the compens@@ ations would have been adopted until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one should have a part of the enum@@ er@@ ations made only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when one plus had been paid upon the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , l@@ ump is also l@@ ump - and not detailed figures , explained the former Ob@@ man explained . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and A@@ spar@@ ators managed the two accused , said the second def@@ endant . &quot;
&quot; why the non @-@ pay@@ outs of the association were not disclosed to detail , asked the judge . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial education , but it is important not only the debt of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the official issu@@ ing of charges of ministry , an amount of 120@@ .000 euros was transferred to the club bank . &quot;
&quot; that may have been ru@@ min@@ ations , explained the def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; this paper @-@ paper analyses the name of the second def@@ endants , and according to the statement , the association was not known . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
&quot; at the point , the owner did not have a look for a long time . &quot;
&quot; then he said he finally , he believed that this was the best for the society . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , the prosec@@ ut@@ or was provided in the room . &quot;
the def@@ endant may have been notified that the function@@ all@@ est become aware of the function@@ ary .
this transfer was formulated as a &quot; prot@@ ru@@ ce &quot; agreement .
why poll@@ ut@@ ants ? you wanted to judge the judge and prosec@@ ut@@ or .
&quot; the first accused , he did not agree with this statement , because the association was never made a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; with whom you are all from the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore the functional , he never referred to a cent of sal@@ ary , he only comp@@ uted mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; in di@@ ets he put an invoice the association of 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
precise documents for the early years could not identify the accused .
&quot; these are after a inspection , in which everything had been judged correctly , was no longer preserved , they explained . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter was also related to the second def@@ endant .
&quot; all will be able to take place in cash , so that he has to travel from his place of living in the international market to the Bank of St@@ burg , in his statement . &quot;
the main proceedings will be continued on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard : more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition for three years on running personnel planning , the computer will intensi@@ vely build further jobs in the event . &quot;
the job offers at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ fying Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) is not an end .
the US @-@ technology group is planning to reduce the reduction of 25.000 to 30.000 sites in its corporate clients .
&quot; by doing so , costs amount to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2,@@ 4 billion euros ) are to be saved , divided the company on Tuesday with . &quot;
the step will lead to a special amount of about $ 2.7 billion that will exp@@ ire in the fourth quarter .
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; HP employed at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 still around 300,000 employees . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : non@@ violence at the Ser@@ bian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have used refugees at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ works against several hundreds of refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has been on the border control of the border inspection .

a group of refugees broke the border .
behind this a police gui@@ del@@ ine had formed and behind the polic@@ eman got a water light ready .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing with stones , sticks and plastic bottles according to the officials . &quot;
the officials used first un@@ interrupted p@@ epper spray .
afterwards the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .

time of decision on interest rates for the US @-@ bank bank
&quot; the world has been observed if the US @-@ note bank will come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade , the interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were asked by Reu@@ ters , found that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will keep some longer and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 25 percent will hold . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates down to NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach the situation in which a large central bank might be leaving the zero area and launching a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , leading employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is based on a relatively good performance , tri@@ llion dollars are added to balance sheet and generating only low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ genic outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; she has war@@ ned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs suggest that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is meant to be announced by 8 AM CET on Thursday
death ar@@ cher on the Delta State University lag@@ ged an ap@@ ple@@ ator
&quot; after the shooting and killing his girlfriend spent in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later his colleague comm@@ anded and t@@ öt@@ ete - he wrote Sh@@ annon : for the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could do it un@@ done &quot; , &quot; gave public authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in the Gau@@ tier , Mississippi &quot; said that &apos;s lectur@@ er for geography and soci@@ ology at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and said , he was shot at someone and someone killed . &quot;
Jacob said the staff of the not@@ aries that the police have send the police polic@@ emen to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; I discovered my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; in the house is that but no one will inter@@ fere , but probably being excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not answer him . &quot;
Lamb there was no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as the police the scene entered , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , the said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I could be und@@ one . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , 300 miles for the Delta State University , where he was E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , sol@@ dered before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen clim@@ bed him around . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ K@@ ge said , he wis@@ er not of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , this was supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there will be &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; triangle relationship &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was named by Sha@@ wn O &apos; Ste@@ en , who said that she was married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced before 15 years , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and they be destroyed . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolute best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to the statement of Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog called light@@ ning , who had been playing with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to always help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said to say related to a particular time on Monday , to say to them , &quot; he does not go into prison . &quot;
&quot; as a polic@@ emen get him on the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , he was driving his car to the side , fled away , ran into the woods and sl@@ ew themselves with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of 2015 , the Delta State University got a doc@@ toral title in the spring of 2015 , like his li@@ mat@@ ory k@@ ew@@ arm at the University &apos;s website . &quot;
stars who have lost their happiness
&quot; actors ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ time partner in Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also alleg@@ edly to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was sentenced by drug owners . &quot;
all this certainly calls for its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa plans a big concert .
half a billion euros in the year want to save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organisation .
150 of the world &apos;s around 1000 executives will cost the workplace har@@ vesting the workplace .
with the pilot @-@ trade union there are in@@ tim@@ ations of the new negotiations .
Lufthansa build up its corporate structure and adds value to the Bil@@ gg@@ to@@ den@@ ser Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the goal of real@@ ign@@ ment is a result of about 500 million euros per year out of cost , and product syner@@ gies , distributed the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no longer a member of the Lufthansa for the passenger in future . &quot;
the al@@ lig@@ flu@@ ous Euro@@ wings are therefore developed as stand@@ alone as possible .
&quot; in the Chief of Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in future . &quot;
&quot; with the re @-@ opening , Sp@@ oh@@ r highlights the importance of Euro@@ wings who will continue to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet Group in future . &quot;
&quot; so far , the organization of the 120 000 staff was complex . &quot;
the airline company under the roof of the passage of the airlines holds the three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the Pil@@ ots
&quot; in collective with the pilot @-@ association Cock@@ pit ( V@@ IC ) , the negotiations are scheduled to be resum@@ ed after the strike and strike on this Thursday . &quot;
this is shared the union with .
theme of the talks should be the tak@@ eover for pil@@ ots .
cock@@ pit &quot; wants to achieve a projected final result in one year as quickly as possible .
the conflict between union and air@@ line led to various strikes in the past few months .
&quot; in addition to the transi@@ tional provision of the pil@@ ots , the pil@@ ots of the pil@@ ots are &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United may not play Mon@@ atel@@ ang for dou@@ bt@@ ful fr@@ act@@ ments
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double tw@@ ist of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven .
&quot; while this brought the left external def@@ ender for wines and exclu@@ de it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by an rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was taken into hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then performed in Manchester .
&quot; it is horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very hard and then fantastic and then happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had a oxygen @-@ mask on .
he cri@@ es .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
&quot; Moreno seemed happy to escape a Red Card and the suspension of a mo@@ l , escape . &quot;
&quot; Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had been mist@@ aken .
&quot; for yourself , you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meters and a red card required . &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ w@@ h &apos;s account was saying , &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my path to recovery begins now , I come back stronger . &quot;
related to : Manchester United in@@ suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w with the defeat at the PS@@ V
the British defen@@ ders has an added incentive to rec@@ u@@ perate for the European Championship in France due to the European Championship in France .
&quot; Philli@@ p C@@ oc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it is a very horrible injury . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all of them are very sad . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
&quot; Moreno suffered a leg , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als &apos;s team at the World Cup 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he does very seriously because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent and if you then hear that there is a very horrible injury , this is not good , &quot; &quot; said C@@ oc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was travelling in another direction so it looked , as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 said Moreno : &quot; I know how it feels when I know how hard to be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I am sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought into hospital - by a F@@ oul@@ k by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents need to learn : if your child loves to book a book , it will not be long before you know it almost right . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems that he was asked to call his favorite children &apos;s book , decided to become Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which 1971 start@@ led environmental cables by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron can write in a message on the site of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I would like to spend my children , as it seems always an image or a message that we have previously missed . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the next paragraph , in which Cameron told to describe the action of the book , instead re@@ produces a summ@@ arized the film version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to extend the fairly short origin@@ al@@ text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled town of Th@@ need @-@ Ville where all nature has gone and even the air is a good , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to see the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage lau@@ ded and the 1991 died , however entirely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that would not be suspic@@ i@@ ously enough : the text contained therein will be partially presented like the summary of the Lor@@ ax @-@ Ville which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air a commodity is , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is the action of the book so little familiar . here stops an un@@ named once @-@ ler despite the protests of the renowned Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ur@@ king being , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low CP@@ D task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per that the Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times after a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ person said that the text probably came from Cam@@ er@@ son &apos;s election office .
&quot; super@@ camps confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons employees were supplied , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still hard to find them . &quot;
&quot; to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you chose the cad@@ res that has chosen England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward win .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page is perhaps less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing list , and the Community spirit is strong ; they will not carry a scar@@ ring of 2012 , just a y@@ outh@@ ful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball is Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he presents a UFO &apos;s size , is an option for the attack . &quot;
in this context @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves out of the England @-@ Test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course , for me as his boss @-@ trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , is difficult to analyze . &quot;
&quot; for his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and simple but harsh realities have been focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I have said this - players to choose their own best choice . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one could have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , if he will hopefully find further shopping for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not bring so good performances and that does not surprise me ; it is especially a team @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; the issue , how much time is a test head@@ man , in order to put his mark is difficult . &quot;
there was seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton has got nine .
only Comp@@ ton was given the chance of home and reverse .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can rise , was that England was first deployed Jonathan Des@@ t in the Caribbean --@@ as Ly@@ th was born in the Caribbean , but this lost sight is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a stroke that I highly recommend . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor crime player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he took up 236 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge square which made us very met . &quot;
&quot; he has to receive at least the same chances as the one prior to it , but of course it depends on the team record in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea , Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide a extra spin @-@ Bow@@ ler , and get four Qu@@ icks , and I have nothing about it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a percus@@ sion@@ man can &apos;t hit there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil of cri@@ cket player . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ ces@@ ter@@ shire , but it is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my past team colleague J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop in 2001 before open@@ er appeared in 2001 .
he has created three hundred feet away and looked not back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari arrives in the cad@@ res as Back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he was very impressed as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people possibly see their statistics - on average 31 with the r@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup professionals who have their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the crew , England has made some smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ ding , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master @-@ coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest ker@@ le of the game , which will bring a wealth of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball @-@ stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring in the locker room fresh air , even if the messages are in line with the previously predicted . &quot;

Bre@@ xit @-@ bearing ( Bre@@ xit = exit Great Britain from the EU ) could win at Zul@@ u if the economy up to 2017 in a fl@@ yer
&quot; David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ balanced fresh wast@@ ew@@ ater strategy to hold the UK in the EU , even without the election of the geni@@ y Jerem@@ y &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the guide of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was sh@@ attered by Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at and recently said that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angl@@ ed in different crises , such as the EU it is now and not always from their own fault , Great Britain itself , created agenda with ges@@ ted conc@@ essions and disturbing contract changes , which they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting , that it does not like it if they thre@@ aten social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister clim@@ bers at summit or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals , make a photo of itself from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they can win the allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , which wishes an open Britain in the inside of the EU &apos;s tent - &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and let us feel more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials in some capitals to the point where we are no matter if we stay or going . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s careful ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office until it looks bad for them like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande looks back on his re@@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland would soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to imagine that they will introduce themselves to a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British to prevent the energy better off the UK - something which they shouldn &apos;t want from the UK - something which they don &apos;t want - because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
&quot; therefore , some such ministers might even inten@@ tionally un@@ inten@@ tionally un@@ accurate notes , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain Spe@@ en@@ dum@@ pl@@ amp@@ agne in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , suspected my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a pl@@ ague &quot; and &quot; Britain has won &apos;t be anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how hor@@ rors can be Fle@@ et Street on its own expense and which EU Sk@@ ep@@ tic is the oligar@@ chy of the press . but not were it during the Tony Ben@@ n inspired refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms in 1975 but not were that our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 supported .
&quot; they may be weak in Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who made a name for himself as an &quot; &quot; EU bar@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ he years . &quot;
&quot; with all his mad@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band knew his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this was the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing jack@@ ets , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ aged foreign countries and the pseudo @-@ In@@ countries that most of our large newspapers possess . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air was very similar to her , but realized that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , one gets better ban@@ anas in order to distr@@ act him instead of going to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the mili@@ o@@ band was more bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ sts as Bl@@ air itself , when Cam@@ er@@ ons referendum was resist@@ ed , for Bl@@ air had turned the principle beyond that of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that he opened up a door @-@ door . &quot;
the press has never heard it before .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me on Monday in Westminster a friendly l@@ apse on the back - I told him that he doesn &apos;t need any time for me to waste it up - seems at danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ der strategy of the 80 @-@ er years to repeat , an error then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take but he needs to develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , his BBC @-@ sofa left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position on Europe is - I think it is friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
now most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ tendency and the wild vessels of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism may possibly say yes to anyone .
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow of law was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ he years , when his old father has to be a willing to go loyal to his labor cab@@ inet@@ ts@@ mate , without losing too far and to lose its cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was still more attractive .
&quot; but to fight , in order to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Ben@@ ns expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his fellow @-@ ben@@ ites and Members upon all reports on the assembly evening . &quot;
&quot; what also wants to convey the tou@@ ching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even touched me - News Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine remains important in the age of TV about the clock and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a brood @-@ center of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe providing Him to keep laboratories in the refer@@ en@@ dum@@ pl@@ ore for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell It said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins is sure that Simon J@@ enk@@ ins will think so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ties to the EU &apos;s membership - in line with their Ben@@ n@@ ite si@@ ege @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dis@@ si@@ dents , which is a central principle of dog@@ mati@@ st disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ity to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C will not be a campaign to withdrawal - will be foreign diplom@@ ats to try to find in all a sense of their superi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin do away political capital , they too have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this can be useless ? &quot;
&quot; the U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a reduction in the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded at the start on Monday of something which was named British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less detri@@ mental than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 persons , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined by critic@@ ise the public health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the load@@ ability of the data and transferred to the links between a few experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily strong foundation &quot; , &quot; on which p@@ he reason@@ ed his most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the alleg@@ ations of stone are built on stone , or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Relations at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ewell , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that the asser@@ tion of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; the present best valuation is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are approximately 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria application ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to create their opinions about the damages from different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ hal@@ ted products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that a sponsor of the meeting had a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report , said they . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting declared a means of an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes maker , but not funding they have received according to reports previously by the Tab@@ ak@@ er@@ company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not delivered but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also specify a range of industrial funding in the paper . &quot;
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in the Tob@@ acco control .
at the meeting the tobacco @-@ leadership of p@@ he took part .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; evidence &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence of most of the products &quot; in most of the criteria , &quot; wrote in Mc@@ Kin@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that the alleg@@ ations of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; there are so far no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes can serve as a path to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; prof Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at p@@ he said that on the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J previously occurred . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his search .
&quot; all evidence sugges@@ ting that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; p@@ he has the unique obligation to inform the public about what evidence of evidence and what is not , especially when there are so much public confusion about relative danger related to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people are dying every year on a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ per year . &quot;
&quot; by the clear proo@@ fs of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of cont@@ amin@@ ants being caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ ends , says former Chief of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop coming programs like East@@ ends and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm for hit shows , such as Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC for making them public @-@ legal programs which probably be seen from a smaller audience , in hard disp@@ uted tim@@ es@@ try to place the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and networks such as BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has tried six years in his time with Channel 4 without success , in contact with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that the BBC programs are in order or sends , which would be clearly demonstrated by non @-@ subsidi@@ zing ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson &apos;s the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication board as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the radio fee , which I consider in the medium or long term not for a good idea , you should at least be able to do his production at least to programmes that do not do others or in order . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window because they want to achieve as widely as possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it is natural nonsense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programme financed , which could be financed even without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ ends is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I am hop@@ eful to see how this should be public @-@ friendly television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a busin@@ es@@ sman for series , channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments about the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC , which again announce what is the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ ne@@ gart presentation at Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows like East@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ alian programmes were to go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they do not meet their tasks , and they argue when they have created on their apparent holy missions to justify the justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ broad@@ casting fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put it in a window in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
&quot; to the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system regarding conditions who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course you think all , thinking that one gets a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who is a lot of money for 150 £ a year , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ Chief David El@@ stein , who also pointed out before the Committee on Tuesday , asking the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission to form and maintain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little from BBC @-@ production would now be classified as education - he said that there is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio , and they should change an example on publicly available TV broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of TV will be shown , and with the commercial networks alliances to make everything available online . &quot;

&quot; the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ ka change the direction in the moment , in which they have dealt with Klang@@ impul@@ ses , who have high frequencies for the human hearing , to be he@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the impul@@ ses are working through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to wear the membrane @-@ waves using ultr@@ aso@@ und waves . &quot;
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , in which ultr@@ aso@@ und can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of one day , is a invasive method , which exists electrical impul@@ ses in the brain of people to treat disease symptoms . &quot;
&quot; claims usually do not react to ultr@@ aso@@ und , but Chal@@ as@@ ani made firm that they had it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , strengthen the ultr@@ aso@@ und waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced ultr@@ aso@@ und waves act on the structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and be found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms .
&quot; the sil@@ k@@ shaft effect the opening of these icons and activate the cells , which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ aso@@ und @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ den , the Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels carry . &quot;
&quot; when it turns out ultr@@ aso@@ und on the changed creatures , the sil@@ k@@ shafts are strengthened through the micro@@ bes and into the wor@@ ms , where they switch the altered Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a pioneering tool , the scientists en@@ cap@@ turing , neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light and switch off . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ic@@ ardi@@ s could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that needs to be disp@@ at@@ ched at a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , N@@ ZE@@ B @-@ und @-@ ultr@@ aso@@ und tissue can happen and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make temporary human neur@@ ons temporary pr@@ one to the ultr@@ aso@@ und signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in students
&quot; eleven years ago I moved to a student dormit@@ ory in a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rail@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense sm@@ iles of those who I up@@ set - and to the numerous , prot@@ rac@@ ed complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence ranges from slightly ner@@ ven@@ ing up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to swe@@ ating : people tell where you come about whether and where you have been taken from Cor@@ m@@ n , and why you say &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite , &quot; because in Ernst , guys , it is just a he@@ ather ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
inhal@@ e through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it acts the conversation and helps you to find the people you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak - even if your lashes would be gr@@ ated by fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverages , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people get themselves bol@@ ted and pull their under@@ wear . &quot;
related : do not remember to start the Uni with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted provides a cru@@ de treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a refu@@ ge , but many students live together form a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be the hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship continues , but you need to go away , so that I get the energy back that I consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a compromise on convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send it an SMS instead of over@@ kno@@ ck .
A@@ pro@@ pos click here : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a non @-@ op door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by b@@ aking .
&quot; as you begin the university at the height of back man@@ ie , the clo@@ cking at the doors of people to imagine themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , much wei@@ rd as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ he years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something to give you . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made delicacies is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain yourself and will keep your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; badly mixed lot of flour , sugar and fat that cause men to sleep sleeping , when you anchor . &quot;
to ste@@ al food is a common crime in student &apos;s homes .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft , but is it taking over a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
verify that with the milk @-@ owner .
&quot; chances are good that they are saying to serve themselves , even if they cook within the inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to get balanced with them as my ro@@ ommate that gave their milk a r@@ ins@@ ant to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise of sleep from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the rich@@ ness to the people who are in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbors , whether it makes them something cruel to put drum and bass , because it was 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they spoke on it with even more prominent music .
&quot; finally when they finally listened to 5 p.m. , her neighbors then sent to sleep two hours before she left her own music , her door shut down and ended up for her three @-@ hour examination . &quot;
would it not be romantic when your future spouse would live by chance in the same student dormit@@ ory ?
&quot; vice versa , if you hold a ro@@ ommate for your future sp@@ ouses , who will stand in them again , and then experience them every day , and perhaps to join it , how to bring all common friends to him ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own paths - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try at least to speak a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the ex@@ hilar@@ ating moment in which you notice that someone has its keys in his un@@ developed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and bullying , is as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good strike is funny , but it only takes moments , until he gets to the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place through po@@ urs a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but don &apos;t miss someone at room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ amp@@ oo .
&quot; close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you will then put in free@@ zer - but do not keep her pos@@ sessions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terr@@ aced houses for refugees , single @-@ speaking , t@@ ing@@ cloth &quot;
the real estate contractor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the medium @-@ Moravian Eck@@ ental town@@ houses for people who did not have much money .
&quot; for instance , for refugees - but also as a signal . &quot; &quot; not only refugees need home space , but also the educ@@ ative mother and the righteous . &quot;
&quot; I show how to get cheap and well built today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees will be pushing for a living room .
the entre@@ pren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly a living room can be created : it builds in a project terr@@ aced houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will push to the market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass@@ ages in containers or turn@@ around has no sustainability .
because people remain a great part here .
&quot; given the refugee stream , we need sufficient living space in the next decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ ana , three @-@ stor@@ ey town house is the solution . &quot;
G@@ ild@@ ner : a terr@@ aced house needs the least place .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
that is different if people are putting people into residential blocks .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three units of each four asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , there is peace , I go back . &quot;

iOS 9 : how you will receive the new iPhone OS if Apple @-@ Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app , select &quot; &quot; gener@@ alities and then &quot; &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot;
when it is ready to download the phone to download and then install the installation .
&quot; some have been stolen from the installation to problems , since they received a error message that fails the &quot; software update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to handle the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or trying to update about iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may possibly mean the delet@@ ing of apps to create room - but Apple has made it harder to do so when you delete a special tool , delet@@ ing apps and then re @-@ install it once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to make sure your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a char@@ ger , so the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple is not able to switch that the update will be continued since the telephone may be swit@@ ched on half way and could lead to a break@@ up of the updates . &quot;
&quot; more : iOS 9 release still in the schedule , despite the watch@@ OS delay in the review of iOS 9 : the least exciting , but the best update of iOS 9 : how to prepare for the new iPhone OS . &quot;
&quot; you should also make sure you have seen before your download our chec@@ kl@@ ist of all things , in order to prevent things wrong and to protect yourself if it is still tun@@ n@@ . iOS 9 brings new functions , including a much cl@@ ever@@ more personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad , as well as changes that speed up and operating the operating system . &quot;

&quot; witnesses look for the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , against 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one of the group , a 17 year old veter@@ an , followed by the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called to them that one might wait for him . &quot;
at this stage the group was at the height of the B@@ FT gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these males now scre@@ ened the young and suggested that with the f@@ ist to the face .
the victim is suffered from a nose @-@ con@@ stri@@ al and ble@@ eding strong from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends h@@ ew@@ ed up and descri@@ bing the r@@ ack@@ et , he first sent down from his sacrifice . &quot;
from his friends the last young man was brought home now .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator saw the group with a car to their apartment and was se@@ ated there several times .
&quot; when you no longer saw the vehicle , the last before the building was to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
&quot; there he was again attacked by the r@@ ack@@ et , and another male person . &quot;
&quot; under the help of a stroke , one tested on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot;
the def@@ endant had to be put to hospital in a hospital .
&quot; until now , only a v@@ ague piece of activity is to be found . &quot;
one of the men was about 1,80 meters large .

Dr. Frank Müller took over practice wheels and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ces@@ ausen .
&quot; moreover , Sam@@ et@@ run@@ about Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic condu@@ ci@@ als Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors are missing - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : there takes over the practice in Dr. Frank Müller on 1st October . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel rock sends into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is his successor to his successor in the next few months with half a passage . &quot;
&quot; after a conversion phase , Müller took the practice on October 12 , until then he is investing 3@@ 10000 euros into the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us street 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy to the first glance , when the rock sees many years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who at present took place her professional practice at the dener hospital and also wants to get into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ces@@ ausen and lau@@ ghing . &quot;
&quot; when it was done , I simply inv@@ oked it . &quot;
&quot; for the couple of Müller , the idea to continue to pursue its own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; said the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families through the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also see his own boss , soon . &quot;
and so you agreed to buy the gar@@ bage purchased the house with the practice .
&quot; living , they will continue to be found in frag@@ ments @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there the two @-@ two family @-@ father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hanover , followed stations in several medical offices , as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; currently , he is active as a ruler in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed for the introductory not@@ ary in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz , and he is engaged in volunteers in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of frag@@ ment @-@ Vil@@ am@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; starting from 19 September , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ces@@ ausen as a utility company , his spouse has specialised in Ur@@ sel ( boarding ) on the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a house . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after the conversion the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ aso@@ und studies as well as long @-@ term and res@@ ili@@ ent EK@@ GS and need an inter@@ phone room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V will be completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant from a total of 50@@ 000 Euro , the tr@@ ash in the context of a funding programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the Zambia ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how pro@@ ud@@ ly and happy we are , that the practice will continue to be proceed@@ ed , &quot; stresses Sam@@ t@@ down @-@ meister Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; about 2000 patients , according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter come into practice in Fel@@ th@@ ausen , in the North German Peri@@ xis , it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is still another house office .
a positive conc@@ e@@ effect of the practic@@ ality by Frank Müller : the Ph@@ armacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor was found , she would have also gone . &quot;
&quot; who &apos;s speaking speaker is attended , by the way , he continues to look in confidential faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the fields . &quot;
&quot; with their part@@ ing ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the medical physician have worked there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot;
a little sad@@ ness you feel after the long time already .
&quot; but we live further in Hohen@@ moor , and many patients will surely see many more often , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; your husband is compl@@ ementary : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square @-@ meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pushed myself from gardening , now it could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ sons and would like to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also high along our south border , &quot; said the Minister of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel with it .
&quot; whether it is clear that each one wants to place an asylum application , this would also be &quot; granted . &quot; &quot;
the safety and safety of the people in the foreground .
&quot; but it is also clear that it should be clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows but do not accept the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia hi@@ des &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia &apos;s plans to reach Austria and Germany too and can also build cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees too .
&quot; quite thus , this was seen as the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach however . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia leads to the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled . &quot;
as the minister stressed that Sloven@@ ian in so does not want its borders to refugees but not .
&quot; every EU member must fill up his obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees would have gone to Tuesday to go to the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d on the border crossing the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , to so@@ ften the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could hold them up in the nearby ma@@ is@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media , since then in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the police vehicles has been employed with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syrian and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
also emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days his land with around 4,000 refugees , said the Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; also , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ bian border , which previously was brought to the Hungarian border , in direction to Croatia , reported Croatian and Ser@@ bian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade does however , however , that it is whether people approach to propos@@ ing specific routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot;
&quot; according to the media reporting , at least in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in Ser@@ bian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day more buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the in@@ mates were all night away from around 500 kilometres away on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary left us , so the police told us that we should leave here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; with this , it could actually be the shifting shifting of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to reach a somewhat further west . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
the Croatian Minister of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously empha@@ sized that his country has prepared appropriate plans for the case of a strong territory of refugees .
&quot; he did not mention it , but pointed out that Croatia is a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot; . &quot; &quot;
there are strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; since 2007 , Slovenia has been part of the EU partners since 2007 , a good record from that which concerns the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on a ser@@ b@@ ular side , behind the Hungarian border region , there are still around 300 refugees . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade , they would have had the past night on the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os that leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees now want to reach the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Ser@@ bian Minister of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic had trying to so@@ ak co@@ il early at a local he@@ on@@ ward in Hor@@ g@@ os : he consider the debates on Altern@@ ate routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
it would not at present have to be very high refugees .
&quot; you can not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
volunteers advise migrants to - dangerous - Altern@@ ativ@@ rou@@ ts
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute the refugees when alternative routes are shown through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian battle still not more spacious min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on the Sunday afternoon the Croatian police gave the police that a team of min@@ ers was sent in the border region .

&quot; the lower prospect is despite the price of survey , which will be an average of 4,@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and in spite of higher accessibility for ground transpor@@ ters of heavy and large packages that will rise from November onwards . &quot;
&quot; the company said , however , it is expected that the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company has a solid y@@ ields , considering the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade , into consideration . &quot;
&quot; the plans for the holidays employment were announced one day later than those of the Ri@@ val UPS , which plans to specify 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5.000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million passed , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; the result per share was talking about excess $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research questioned an@@ al@@ ysts predicted . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of the results asked for al@@ ysts - 12.@@ 23 billion .
Fed@@ Ex has in recent years reported a decline in the international ranking disp@@ atch that brought sales to his unit express disp@@ atch .
but the boom in online @-@ shopping has increased the results with Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales rose by 29 per cent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express @-@ unit awarded higher profits due to higher prices , while the result obtained due to higher labour costs in cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , altern@@ ating the Fed@@ Ex stock by 3.@@ 85 % , or 2.5 per cent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
on Tuesday she closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11th .
&quot; on their most expected meeting in the years , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ oni spend two days a week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table sitting in order to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time since almost a decade to raise it up . &quot;
&quot; dor@@ man@@ t on them at an end of the published , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seat just is a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ way order from Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the major recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is a failed third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision which is too tight to pre@@ di@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to reconc@@ iled from the un@@ parall@@ eled favourable rate of interest since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets are already anxi@@ ous to increase this vol@@ ati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government - and be it just around one quarter of percentage . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ist in the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think it was looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justi@@ fication , continuing to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the f@@ ed is doing , resulting in itself the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists were asked recently by Bloom@@ berg , the interests have predicted that week . &quot;
&quot; however , financial markets expect a dra@@ ining of the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ k@@ ator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline of the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the shr@@ ubs cre@@ asing the strike by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday morning of the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage worth 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or about 1,@@ 4 % to 16.@@ 5@@ 99@@ ,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; this action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policies allows the sentence in this week , says John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the propositions at that point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , they would have to go very far in their explanation to so@@ ften the financial markets , so that they have not panic attack . &quot;
&quot; other experts argue that an interests would so@@ ften the financial markets , because it would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed is going to act . &quot;
&quot; still a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set about .@@ percent@@ ages in this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of the lun@@ ar conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said this year in spring and early summer , despite the complaints from liber@@ als that would be more economic progress in this year , an increase in the proposition . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow , the improvement on the labour market in the year was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate sank to 5.5 % in the past month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level that sees the F@@ ed as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly passed under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives told that the main reason was the temporary impact of much lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can manage higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets all over the world coinci@@ ded at the end of last month , after China had checked its currency . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage was expected in May to more than 16 % among its peak , as investors feared that a slo@@ wing of the Chinese economy would increase global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly in this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now at nearly 10 % under the pole of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influence the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have occurred in the last few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow in the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US @-@ Not@@ en@@ bank . &quot;
he pre@@ di@@ ct that she will wait at least a month to get the impact better on the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in their decision @-@ making process . &quot;
but in the En@@ de@@ ff@@ ect the F@@ ed Monetary Union has become the world .
the influence of the central bank in recent years has enormously .
&quot; the mere reference of the then leit@@ ner Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could be their mon@@ ary expansion &quot; &quot; confined &quot; &quot; Tur@@ b@@ ulation around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly deterior@@ ated , can be expected from the F@@ ed representatives , but can also be monitoring developments in other central banks , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements , which apparently does not seem linked to economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; acker , a predic@@ tive member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which supports interests of interests in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its gu@@ ins for the 0,75 percentage points in three sessions , despite limited recognizable effects on growth in the U.S. &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives spread this cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as market re@@ unification in 2008 , Adam S. Posen , former member of the Committee for the interest of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il are not coming to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to fall into the situation in which she is afraid of a Zin@@ ca@@ vities , because the markets sti@@ ched itself , &quot; said Poznań , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains double mandate and do not mention financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think that it should hur@@ ry the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
&quot; to offer you a warm welcome , does not go without the dedication of an volunteer hel@@ per . &quot;
&quot; also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people , who support an un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seeker in the city . &quot;
among them belong Petra and Klaus H@@ one .
Petra H@@ one is with body and soul teacher .
also with their 74 L@@ enzen she has always taught them .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seeker at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; there she helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is quite different classes than at the right school . &quot;
Brazilian company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
Span@@ i@@ pa@@ edi@@ atric Organization SP@@ RS seeks to clarify in sho@@ cking ways women how important good nutrition during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies which are painted over breasts , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that require babies to provide all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers need to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake , about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ et@@ etic adaptation that the mothers should do . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet com@@ anger@@ ed women actually the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negative . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ies of the sports hall
the council Bern@@ ried authorized the construction contract for the 2.4 million euros costly sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ past@@ age gymn@@ asium is taking step by step forward : in the recent council meeting , the work@@ book was un@@ folded without great discussion . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the panel was adopted among other things a request for a &quot; &quot; legal &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; from the current construction plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form in relation to the bad@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a &quot; saddle @-@ roof was designed with non @-@ mit@@ er first and roof @-@ top &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the background of the planning is the intended use of the rooftop space for solar installations : &quot; &quot; this is where we get a wonderfully large south @-@ roof , &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; for the &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; it was about the loft which is coming from energetic reasons - other than in the construction plan , under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; emancipation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan concerning the roof incl@@ ination is no &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - whereby the am@@ ber of the council is generally running with fre@@ eing contracts . &quot;
&quot; however , in the gymn@@ asium , this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create precision diar@@ rhe@@ a , &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ asium is a joint project by the community and the SV Bern@@ ried .
around 2,@@ 3 million euros have been calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from the school and gr@@ ass@@ roots fund .
&quot; in the next process of procedures , the order entry for the 18 x 36 meters will now be presented to the Land@@ rat@@ ch@@ as for its inspection . &quot;
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg draws to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is intended to be opened earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
simultaneously Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) of new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees draw from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this is the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , and the land@@ lady of Andrea Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on the board was made by the Super@@ visory Board , and the conven@@ ing at the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if plans are implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority of these can move with fishermen and the further existing station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
&quot; the collabor@@ ators , who can not be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the staff will be informed about the plans .
&quot; the change has been triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Managing Director of Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in direct proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; when asked about who to start our succession , according to Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , which was prepared to take over the leadership from October 1 , and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au acts in any case the &quot; &quot; upgrading &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the section &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; so Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ white . &quot;
Fischer is specialised in the heart of cardi@@ ac and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in the internal station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; proceeding for the next two years fishermen with his team should turn out fisher@@ man with his team , when the Super@@ visory Board will open the former houses , until then next year the former hospital is the sl@@ ain that is still going to be closed more than 35 beds in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the county of this region had been planned for 2018 if the ongoing refurb@@ ishment works at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital . &quot;
&quot; land@@ lady Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Super@@ visory Board , entered ru@@ gs the house that is located in the possession of the Federal Council , in future as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers should be used . &quot;
&quot; that I close . &quot; as it moves with the property , Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say that there are several refl@@ ections . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and an daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; what bes@@ es could not happen to us , such an occasion does not come back , &quot; as fishermen about the Qu@@ asi @-@ Moving to Le@@ ch who had been positive and very comprehen@@ sively informed by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , in which fishermen have worked as a boss , did not give it . &quot;
he may have been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take the post of the doctor &apos;s director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was always threatened by closure , departments were closed , for example surgery and Obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Lion are now required in the evening ( 20.@@ 30h ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
&quot; the tab@@ ular of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal , the clear Favor@@ it , occasion for pre@@ tension is however none . &quot;
&quot; last season , the bathing at the B@@ HC is a pain k@@ ary defeat and have a good ben@@ ign . &quot;
Jag@@ dun@@ geon with two verti@@ ces at Pr@@ at@@ au
two Tr@@ actor @-@ drivers are severely in@@ ju@@ red during their Ma@@ is@@ ern@@ te on the afternoon .
&quot; during the Aber@@ n@@ board at a ma@@ is@@ field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police were h@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; after a donation , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; how exactly this could happen to the accident , was first unclear . &quot;
the cid @-@ police were determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate victims of non@@ violence
a fact @-@ suspic@@ ious has led the police to the body who has missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate .
&quot; in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the young people were killed and their body have thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
one since Saturday the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate is a victim for@@ ting to the victim .
&quot; the Lei@@ che of young woman was found at the Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , like the prosec@@ ut@@ or police and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as it can be seen as tat@@ too , 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was in fact st@@ led the statement , and the investig@@ ators led to the foundations of the body . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning after she was on Saturday after a visit of a autumn l@@ ump in rock@@ enh@@ ausen didn &apos;t come back home .
&quot; in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators gather first on personal items of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in surveys in the friends of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the suspic@@ ious , there was eventually a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the ex@@ or@@ ical perpet@@ r@@ ator led the police to a channel in rock , where the cor@@ pse was found . &quot;
&quot; the ar@@ rest were made to the authorities according to the police officers , who killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and took the body in the channel . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented on Wednesday of the third party , the investig@@ ators lay hold him tot@@ tering . &quot;
ob@@ cl@@ ue about the closer circumstances of the act should bring the further investigation .
refugees need accommodation : study warning against residential bridge
the location on the German market market is tense .
&quot; again , more and more refugees seek a paid base . &quot;
the pressure on the housing market grows .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution battles on the German urban@@ ization has long begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and vis@@ itation from the EU , more and more people are pushing towards a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with income @-@ weak citizens around the last paid apartments .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , would have to build 400,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; with this result , a study on behalf of the &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; comes from a research on behalf of &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by comparison : this year , there are 26@@ 0,000 units in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus , 14@@ 0.000 apartments are lacking . &quot;
&quot; refugees are no more oblig@@ ated after the first three months of their stay , when asylum seek@@ ers lived in an initial upward accommodation . &quot;
&quot; then , many come across the market , and go into the long sn@@ akes in front of the flat rentals . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of the Federal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the urban@@ ization is not only at the rising refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the construction industry of recent years .
Germany laun@@ ches a housing deficit in front of itself which is getting bigger from year to year .
&quot; currently in the metropol@@ itan areas , there were already some 77@@ 0.000 dwelling units , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many working people therefore lived in Grand @-@ cities in shared rooms .
young adults continued because of the flu@@ ent on the domestic market le@@ aking longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities the number of square meter per head in the past few years has declined dramatically .
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; suggests a new start . &quot;
the new incentives should boost social housing construction again .
thus could be disp@@ ens@@ ed to the Gr@@ under@@ wer@@ bs@@ ql and the fundament@@ tax of subsidi@@ zed apartments can be suspended .
&quot; moreover , according to alliances attractive tax @-@ tools opportunities are needed . &quot;
the funding programmes for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the state bank K@@ f@@ W is now well connected to towns and villages .
&quot; a good week after the start was on Monday afternoon with 184 million euros , more than half of the amount collected at the disposal of some 300 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project might even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free funds : Croatia and Slovenia to take cor@@ ridor
&quot; after Hungary no longer has to go through , more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces that the transit across Slovenia to north without hur@@ dles .
but dangerous is the route nevertheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia for the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian inner conductor , and when it is necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria , and is already part of the Schengen area . &quot;
the EU @-@ country of Croatia is not a Schengen area .
&quot; after the stop@@ over of the Ser@@ bian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrive to Croatia to arrive from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people came across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik reports about the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had alli@@ ed its border to refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws which occurred the same day in force , make this decent asylum procedures in Hungary practically super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; Croatian Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; you can travel through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something . &quot;
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in the morning .
&quot; the majority of women in the media report according to Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came by bus and tax@@ en in the Ser@@ bian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after her arrival they would have tried to get on foot across the green border to Croatia .
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ bian border , the refugees are not across the border . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border stri@@ ps other dangers - there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
min@@ e@@ acial plans to set up a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , after the closing of the border , there are barely any more refugees . &quot;
on Tuesday the police declared the police 36@@ 6 .
&quot; shortly before the gate on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws inter@@ fere with the overcoming and damage of the bor@@ dering us as a crime .
in the South Hungarian border town Sz@@ eged will therefore have 35 criminal proceedings .
the condemned pen@@ al prison sentence up to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday , one has signed up on Tuesday in the newly @-@ appointed border zone &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sit@@ ing zones &quot; &quot; in total 94 asylum applications , almost all - 93 - the most important transition . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , 13 families with young children and two elderly people . &quot;
on Mit@@ ter@@ och@@ o tomorrow there have had 40 refugees to be held there .
&quot; practically , no one has a view to get asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ ambig@@ uous view , Serbia is a &quot; safe @-@ third country . &quot; &quot;
the derived asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported to there .
before the &quot; Tran@@ sit@@ z@@ ke &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke gathered only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to leave .
&quot; they gathered the tr@@ ash , which left the tens of thousands of people in the past weeks on the road@@ side . &quot;
pl@@ ywood have been reduced and one of the form@@ ers in the bor@@ derland was rebuilt .
&quot; to the goal of this set , nobody wanted to express itself . &quot;
Austria after the close closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary is only a few refugees .
the country also has reinforced its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 immigrants in the country stood still in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , approximately 1400 people are waiting for the way to Germany . &quot;
the public transport sector from there to Germany was stopped in the morning in the German government .
in Frei@@ l@@ ass@@ ing regularly met small groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor was the &quot; &quot; mess@@ enger &quot; &quot; about the border &quot;
&quot; we were busy after the Br@@ ücken@@ fest on Sunday with the au@@ fr@@ aming , when suddenly there were ten people with travel off@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists they wanted to go to Pass@@ au by train .
&quot; but Germany on Sunday but because of the refugee stream in the railway traffic with Austria had been set surprising , it was the conclusion for her in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; said City Council , which immediately got his help and the mess@@ enger to the River Nahe river Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before , we expected the un@@ hoff@@ tes guests once again , with tasting and drinks . &quot;
we said we will drive them to Pass@@ au .
&quot; of course it was for us , &quot; says Stad@@ l in O@@ Ö@@ N discussion . &quot;
they were very grateful .
&quot; a man did not let it take , to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for fire bri@@ g@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; this was very happy , &quot; &quot; said City . &quot;
&quot; on the Sunday evening at the Wels of the ICE in Wels from an ICE in a regional train direction Pass@@ au , it was cancelled after the short notice that the railway traffic to Germany was set to try , but still trying to try the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was put down before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein is the cross @-@ border in general high in the course .
&quot; the Br@@ ücken@@ fest with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday sear@@ ched , the day before a two @-@ year @-@ up spor@@ ty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án can now turn further aside to us is a logical result of a seem@@ ing sacred policy :
&quot; instead of helping in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately at the establishment of structures , which guarantee humanity , our Federal Chancellor expressed arrogan@@ tly and publicly expressed the position of the Hungarian government in the dun@@ geons . &quot;
condem@@ nation of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced in the bor@@ dering areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; the whis@@ pers will have to establish that the &quot; &quot; mis@@ ed Land &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will become a major challenge , given the continuing refugee streams and the approaching winter , with us to establish decent states for protection seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad on the quest for 35.@@ 000 har@@ row Quar@@ ry
Konrad has filled all hands with the refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government has deployed the previous powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ ban@@ ker to raise the arti@@ sm for thousands of refugees .
the chaos at the first@@ center Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he re@@ reported by his first success . &quot;
&quot; the lodging of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday , be without great power , Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master@@ performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the ministry , however , spoke of a &quot; cr@@ is@@ cop@@ ing situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; overall counts Konrad with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ing year . &quot;
&quot; to fulfill the number , we have to be found even 35.@@ 000 accommodations within the next few weeks - 20,000 people will provide a 15,000 of the Bund . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a case without the ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
the state of the state has already been held talks .
they have promised him also for the coming refugees quot@@ a .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works fine , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Scho@@ born without diver@@ ting how the Church will help .
&quot; great expectations puts the asylum coordin@@ ator also in the OR@@ F promotion , &quot; like we . &quot;
on the platform private people can offer basic accommodations .
&quot; in addition , one hopes to find hotels that are empty during the winter time . &quot;
Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation than &quot; very high . &quot;
&quot; in case of note , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ len@@ ders must have a certain height of to@@ wel @-@ ke@@ eper or size of the surface . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period need &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; that he was more successful in contrast to the home office , based on accommodation , based Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentl@@ eman , which one does not say without further into the face of the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is its most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause any costs as they explained .
your employees want them to raise them on three to four .
the own lod@@ g@@ ings was far not successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz in the office .
but there is clearly problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; first , no opening of city sports activities and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for accommod@@ ated refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as one can currently dis@@ integrate these measures without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
further sites can be checked for emergency purposes .
cri@@ tique of the city council in the distribution of refugees within the state of the state .
other areas must contribute to their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed
in a longer phone call with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) has en@@ coded by the governor Josef P@@ it@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday the next steps in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off .
the claims of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continue to be possible .
but there is now the corresponding border controls .
special lifts with refugees in Germany will not give it any more .
but the def@@ ences would however be brought with regular journeys to Germany .
&quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ ing has once more increased solidarity in the refugees of refugees . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria leads to its borders again , is &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; the &quot; &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; at the Lin@@ zer industry line is officially closed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T engaged , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is intended to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ Chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can imagine to invest in start @-@ up companies in the New ship@@ yard and later on which to ac@@ qui@@ ti@@ sts them .
&quot; from the start , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - a lot of which is down to Nieder@@ haus@@ er : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.1 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million Euros of the Tech@@ center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is designed from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and technical center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres in the building are rented , for another 40 per cent give it requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the Arctic
in the new shop are Fur@@ la @-@ Hand@@ bags in the center .
&quot; actually , Jut@@ ta wanted to put a dog to a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to postp@@ one the 49 @-@ year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the bar@@ red market arc@@ ade , and finally she has gains entry into the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop facing the company where they sold among other cases bags , suitcases , shoes and gar@@ b of different manufacturers , is now all around fl@@ amen@@ ets of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros to have . &quot;
greater po@@ ckets and accessories for up to 500 Euro .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
&quot; before , several weeks has been changed . &quot;
&quot; but I have long before , whether I should open a shop to a shop , &quot; says broad . &quot;
&quot; deciding on the decision was among other things , that also the Fur@@ la Produ@@ c@@ ers , which in Bologna are at home , from the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the ambitious in Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has himself Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion interest has been wide placed by her mother in the cradle .
this is the most when something developed and I can show new trends at reasonable prices .
why so some woman with a beautiful hand@@ bag in in@@ deli@@ ver@@ ance can also answer the wife with last safety .
maybe it is because that a lovely bag is used every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the tw@@ ist ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called for .
this characteristic also connects to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for one @-@ off .
&quot; whether it is expressed by xen@@ opho@@ bic , journalists , or scientific gaps in the international crisis policy : the applic@@ ant for the US presidential tax should be strongly influenced the electoral campaign . &quot;
and cuts down well .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ alz K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the &apos; property @-@ milli@@ ard &apos; . &quot;
the New Yorker with the well @-@ term in the wine village is a concept many in the wine @-@ village at the wine road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant place is over -@@ enty corners with it related .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pfalz : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del has a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , the most powerful man of the world ? &quot;
&quot; I think this is somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their bud@@ ding species , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous explo@@ os@@ s@@ loop directed to which in addition to Tru@@ mp also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mod@@ est@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to Word - so with the statement that he would surely also succeed when he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; to the king of the hearts , he did not have it there . &quot;
&quot; true , I give respect for the performance of the family , but also po@@ ison@@ ing the opinion that Tru@@ mp is already a bit a sou@@ l@@ oud@@ mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; evi@@ dently the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - too high @-@ German : the offer , says it . &quot;
Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the offering .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather out@@ flow and in the US opened a local min@@ er for the min@@ er . &quot;
the property of the property &apos;s real estate company were the first property purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from Trag@@ ik : their desire to return to the home , failed on the Bav@@ arian state , to which the Pfalz was back then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he was once distr@@ ust out without permission , the Director of the Institute for pf@@ alz History and Wh@@ ology , Roland Paul , were invited to the film start . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the declar@@ ations of the afternoon .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to aver@@ se illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the pol@@ der , that is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote relationship ( &quot; The O@@ ma was an born Tru@@ mp , the Op@@ a was born @-@ born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ em@@ akers in retirement sees the Americans rather detached , &quot; &quot; he is always so up@@ setting . &quot;
believes that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine myself , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt .
&quot; the Pen@@ zi@@ or@@ tin Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family has ended with a visit to something for the church organ , which was generally good . &quot;
&quot; this can &apos;t I imagine of the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they f@@ ist it better if he does not do the choice , for &quot; he has such radic@@ als views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; those who have had the age of his grandfather in the US , had been as he would have never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; the grapes are also ri@@ pe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ del Film , has been inter@@ viewed for the Tru@@ mp long , have seen 12 000 kin@@ og@@ ist , even in the USA . &quot;

&quot; this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to play a role for Australian TV audience , since Sun@@ rise has achieved some 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spect@@ ators in the five capitals compared to these today at 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase in the ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today in the last few months today the gap has to Sun@@ rise .
&quot; in August there reached an average of 3@@ 18.@@ 000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; until now in September Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ 9,000 spect@@ ators of 3@@ 14.@@ 000 today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happened every morning .
the winds of change affect this dawn more than the Parliament !

critics were asked if Thom@@ son hit a hit @-@ show Solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; YES &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million spect@@ ators and hit slightly The Block ( 8@@ 38.@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam is the perfect man - but whom will he chose ?
secret : ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have ignor@@ ant of who The Bachelor wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , finally , at Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally ends , was covered in biggest secrecy . &quot;
&quot; and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not award if they have the one that has received the last rose . &quot;
&quot; but when we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows in the day before coming out of three two , ein@@ gs , you possibly have given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women proved themselves in a ly@@ rical way , why wood is the perfect man and he called his sense of humor , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is posed &quot; If not you , who was supposed to receive a last rose ? &quot; , &quot; could their responses to the game sp@@ oil be who won the heart of the Bachelor . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki c@@ anned both - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with one another from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed that they were quite compatible , and I thought it was the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah comes with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; he added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit was a last week to make her clear that Wood . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now de@@ duc@@ ted on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom Wood choose , if not she , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I do not know if I can say this , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the left @-@ deser@@ ved girls alike - it is an un@@ decided between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his rel@@ ocation to the USA - and there were many other teams following an impressive open training session at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart choice .
some coach would have banned Hay@@ es for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost an angel such as the Aussie Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ League con@@ verti@@ ces at his first P@@ unt @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ esota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt Return and also into the game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continue to prove his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies to ma@@ ize the rest of the team by the mill he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also publicly during his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne has also encouraged by special teams Co@@ ordinator Thomas Mc@@ Kin@@ gh@@ ey who spoke to him , for@@ getting his ver@@ p@@ atz@@ ten flies and to take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t was restored in a p@@ unt which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ esota Vi@@ kings .
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive stalli@@ on for his N@@ FL @-@ debut . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne left after the F@@ um@@ ble flu@@ ent the playing field and told later the Australian radio duo and Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start to his N@@ FL career . &quot;
&quot; it was a thing that is occurring now , it only takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne teaches the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 , when a passport in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y for Queensland . &quot;

but the rec@@ tor of the refugees now domin@@ ates the free voters .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
Ai@@ w@@ anger called for the establishment of the UN Human Rights Committee for refugees in Syria and in the 1990s during the Yugoslavia .
&quot; so it does not go further , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot;
the asylum seek@@ ers want to de@@ duct the free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ v@@ anger also demanded more staff for the administrative courses that are responsible for asylum @-@ complain : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;

&quot; however , this goes not far enough . &quot;
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums that want to do this .

4 people killed after the polic@@ emen were shooting at demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal when the police were clim@@ bed into a crowd , that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on the evening of the S@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , leading District Apostles , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of you were stones and burned bom@@ bs . &quot;
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot in the air before being back on rubber .
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were wo@@ unded , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber industry used by which it is possible to kill them , but traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , apparently such a high rate of death . &quot;
&quot; the discussion was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal on the south side , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi declar@@ ing that new provinces come from the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence . &quot;
&quot; there were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the ethnic group , who want their own state . &quot;
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were conducted in violent conflicts since the 10 . &quot;
&quot; August killed , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been ruled out for centuries . &quot;
&quot; working on a new constitution since 2008 has been on its way , but the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors accelerated this process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed in April thousands of people . &quot;
&quot; the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors have expressed this week over certain cl@@ auses in the Constitutional Court , and officials said that the new constitution might come into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the land of the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be converted again .
the city is currently preparing for the marketing of the 4000 @-@ meter area .
&quot; planned is a mix of trade , commerce and living - concrete offers are still not available . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market a roughly 4000 square meters of land in direct vicinity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently running .
&quot; planned to use the site for a mix of trade , commerce and living . &quot;
&quot; waiting for such offerings , means it from the city . &quot;
which investor to query would not yet be clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were closed . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located at the ring road / corner Large road , bought several months ago and will tear the building on it . &quot;
project h@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planners at the holiday homes in the little sea at Em@@ den take shape .
the investor submitted public plans for the project for the first time .
several candidates are concerned - they are concerned about selling their recreational centres .
&quot; Mon@@ atel@@ ang has been behind closed doors , followed , deb@@ ated and marked . &quot;
&quot; now , the plans for a new cottage settlement on the Small Island near Em@@ den at the table . &quot;
&quot; the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized em@@ aker of the Company &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; &quot; presented its plans for the first time on the Assembly evening . &quot;
originally this point was on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; under the pressure of the project cri@@ tic and the F@@ DP group , which warn the investors and the administration of secret armies , Ralf B@@ ehr@@ ends from the System @-@ Bau @-@ Leadership in the off@@ ense : &quot; &quot; we have not yet received an answer to all questions , &quot; &quot; he said before the members of the Council and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to encounter all the rum@@ ors now .
the project has been in discussion about ten to twelve million euros .
&quot; fier@@ ce reactions among the marine assets , which had come into the session , called the images and new details to the desired building structure . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and board member in the Inter@@ medi@@ ate of An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , said : &quot; this becomes a giant cl@@ ot@@ z , that over@@ looks all the other Geb@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; moreover , he feared as a few other project cri@@ tic that would increase traffic by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; there all the bus inv@@ itations are coming , so that the project counts . &quot;
&quot; what happens on the well made of a h@@ ect@@ are of the former Gast@@ stätte , it is still open . &quot;
nor is there no operator .
&quot; only do we need to have a conclusi@@ ve concept , &quot; said Ralf B@@ ehr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this still l@@ acked , be also the construction plans still variable . &quot;

Google laun@@ ches temporary donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ don@@ ating campaign , which aims to help thousands of refugees who survived the thousands of refugees , since they fl@@ ee from the war from torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the disclosure of donations into his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement make , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; on our journey were many dark railway and bus cru@@ ises , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but as the refugee and migrants crisis in Europe grew , many people like my family are des@@ per@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; the donations are going to four non @-@ profit organisations providing help for refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first global donations has to be doubled up to a value of 5,@@ 5 million on googl@@ e.@@ com. &quot;
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has distributed more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many lights also from the war against Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

for easy to di@@ ab@@ etic di@@ ab@@ etics can be useful for weight loss .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to say whether it is easily overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery longer than those who have non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality rate require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which has written an editorial approach to the new study in J@@ ama Sur@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absor@@ b food .
&quot; over the years , it has proven to be effective in the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies were carried out with people who have been tos@@ sing with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain level of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data that have collected them in a study since 2007 and compare two types of Adi@@ posit@@ as surgery - mag@@ en@@ b@@ yp@@ ass and magn@@ ate fo@@ al - for medical treatments for type @-@ 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who subjected to this operation , decreased from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I was with those who did not have surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who subjected to a surgical procedure , at 36 % the diabetes condition completely and at 28 % partial . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , the comparison with diabetes is completely at one percent and partly only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitoring the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent to write the researchers .
after the surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level of approximately 9 percent to around 6 percent .
&quot; however , in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as is reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not the mortality in five years , so the researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also negoti@@ ates average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year the B@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater recur@@ r@@ ages in BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.3 % ) and reported more than a complete overthrow of the diabetes ( 46,@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study has no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was with obes@@ e people who subjected to a obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group , the conventional methods tried . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone , it was so@@ othing for people with BM@@ I among 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without pushing the risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone , added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we too long wait , until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they accum@@ ulate these genetic changes , that have accumulated their body with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;
love @-@ History plays in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is a subject that is currently paying attention to fiction : a young lady , too di@@ lig@@ ently and uns@@ atis@@ ed , meets after years the flock of her youth again , and this one loves himself in her . &quot;
so also in the recently created novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love history , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ r@@ er reader , for he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;

it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader asked to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the UK meeting in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford that has dedicated to ethics trials .
he called for under the circumstances the interests of humanity ought to be placed before the interests of each nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries had been admir@@ able to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama &apos;s Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that it is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but meanwhile you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for this Muslim countries can be created . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the k@@ ill@@ ings in their countries will be decreased . &quot;
we must reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these issues , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and commented to George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack from September 11 and turned out that the US @-@ violent reaction of the US was a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 I expressed my p@@ ity in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and this has stir@@ red consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ day increase in intake of hand san@@ iti@@ zer through children over the past 4 years
&quot; po@@ ison control centers in the US report about an almost 400 % increase in the number of children under 12 years , the strongly alcoholic hand san@@ iti@@ zer , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , sti@@ cking the cases of revenues of hand inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the tox@@ ins inspection centers will report from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children always come more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go out in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants dro@@ pl@@ ess to drink while some of it to impress their friends or because of a Mut@@ ress of the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap adventure .
young people are supposedly being dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with non @-@ alcohol m@@ outh@@ wash to obtain a tough@@ er beverage .
younger children can be ch@@ oked by attractive sc@@ ents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ ected .
&quot; there is dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berries , grapes and orange du@@ els , which are very pleas@@ ing for children . &quot;
hand san@@ iti@@ zer contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children can lead a few sy@@ ringe at the alcohol po@@ ison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ison Centre at the Hospital of K@@ ansas , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you &apos;d never let loose whis@@ ky whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and if children come from it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , which had recently taken four sy@@ ringe from after straw@@ berry du@@ ster @-@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was killed in an emergency treatment . &quot;
&quot; your blood non @-@ alcoholic beverages was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which in an adult is illegal as dr@@ unk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ch doctor who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was unable to go as she arrived at the Emer@@ gency .
doctors super@@ vised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of deer trau@@ ma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had absorbed the head said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use soft @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol po@@ ison@@ ing there were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant associated with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the sl@@ ing of hanging san@@ iti@@ sers that have a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; healthcare authorities susp@@ ect that the product meth@@ anol is contained , a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ yl@@ al@@ co@@ hol , which became known as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January he planned three students of the fourth class in the state New York to det@@ ox@@ i@@ fy their &quot; &quot; teacher &quot; &quot; by providing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says it a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ iti@@ zer and ex@@ iles it out of their room .
the police regarded the deriv@@ ative plan as &quot; &quot; Gesch@@ los@@ tz &quot; &quot; and disgu@@ ised measures to the school authority . &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three cars damaged

&quot; as a result , he in@@ duc@@ ted with his truck in the rear of an audience and sh@@ out this vehicle on one before , Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; on the accident @-@ involved vehicles , the super@@ damage was made by approximately 10 000 Euro , the police shares with them . &quot;

the lack of title competition in the Scottish Little Gre@@ ens - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national players of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , since there are no titles @-@ ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently a amb@@ assador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland she does not show highlights from Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the r@@ ake is not there .
people here do not only talk about the return of the stran@@ gers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland that want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn the things around , s@@ add@@ led Dei@@ la . &quot;
Ronn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic need to fight but the Norwegian boss c@@ or to turn things around .
&quot; after the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent retirement from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by the ten @-@ man of Aber@@ de@@ en , who now stand up with five points to be clear at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said : &quot; Celtic had already bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel this exactly - but we need to go on .
&quot; we really need , really the Celtic support because that makes the player better . &quot;
up to now is so important .

&quot; Mc@@ In@@ nes said : &quot; &quot; there is no squ@@ ad who has won every thing in po@@ kal@@ ine or le@@ agues , the games of this kind also did not win . &quot;
unemployment remains unchanged throughout the UK as a whole .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained in the period May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole during the same period has risen to EUR 10,000 to a maximum of EUR 10,000 . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s work rate is about 5.5 per cent over that of the U@@ KS by 5.5 per cent such as the figures of the National Statisti@@ cs Office ( s ) .
&quot; meanwhile , the employment in Scotland fell at 12@@ ,000 during the three months with the number of employees at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
the employment rate of Scotland fell in the course of the quarter at 7@@ 4.3 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3,5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary of Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; The long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it &apos;s almost exactly one year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; during these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the economic labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I will be witnesses of an Ex@@ o@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a bit later today , except in late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard Glos@@ sip will be executed by the tox@@ ins . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was issued for the first time in January over his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day comes closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since often more applicants are available as seats , find a macro lot@@ tery to decide which is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five .
who is selected will be an emoti@@ ve .
I cannot do that .
I will sit in addition to Richard Glos@@ a &apos;s narro@@ wer friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often lau@@ gh many if we talk .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not allow me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to take what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
&quot; a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma performed me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoners how he wants it and you get access .
I complain about it .
&quot; she dre@@ amed that she could have &quot; &quot; it could have better form@@ ulate &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong , what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that an international re@@ por@@ ter is present to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against death penalty . &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ por@@ ter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I did . &quot;
I will not want to go here again for all details here .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sy is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would render him guilty to be a benefici@@ ary of deeds .
&quot; but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of the murder . &quot;
I believe that there is no enough evidence to justify a deaths .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really obj@@ ectively .
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters to which you can apply for it .
&quot; what you will get from me is , what it means , a man shall die in the necessary death . &quot;

&quot; an attempt to a man of Per@@ th to exit the police was un@@ successful , when he was in sei@@ ling and su@@ mp@@ tuous water was only a few meters from a police be@@ am@@ ten that tried to talk &quot; &quot; him gentle to talk , to the shore . &quot;

Peter Moody said that the stew@@ ards tried to sp@@ y him and threat@@ ens the racing sport
Peter Moody said that Stew@@ ards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables in the past year and dro@@ pping the race immediately .
he walked on the stew@@ ards and the integrity of the Racing Victoria and asser@@ ted that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last St@@ roh@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tries to do what is best for racing sport and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it was the positive Kob@@ alt preparation test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he can not explain . &quot;
&quot; he had ref@@ ra@@ ined once 18 months because of the sp@@ y days , and did not want it to see it , such as too high over@@ throwing grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are frustr@@ ated that everything is coming out at once &quot; &quot; said Moody . &quot;
you know that it continues .
&quot; sometimes you have to react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with them what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well today .
&quot; I want to go down the main point , and I want my owners think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they begin to think , I do not do this , then I should not be more trainer . &quot;
then I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moody the Bom@@ b had in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , leaving the &quot; &quot; integrity department &quot; &quot; had tried to sp@@ y its stable . &quot;
&quot; prior to eigh@@ teen months Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stew@@ art in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moody on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they obviously believe I am an fraud .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly put into their n@@ oses , because they attempt to believe me , failed . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , right . Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ y , acting president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of this time and are still today . &quot;
should I make this a view that it is personally ?
does the RV@@ L conduct itself and maybe people outside of instruc@@ tors are responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license , and rejected me , and I have no doubt that what I say is thinking about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I am now at the point where it does not matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will exercise the pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the coaches in the trainer have built themselves with the long @-@ long cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to that he said that he could throw his license about the table . &quot;
&quot; Moody &apos;s best known by his preparation of the un@@ ador@@ ned master &apos;s Black C@@ avi@@ ar , referred to the round @-@ tags treatment rule &quot; , &quot; after a package mud or sound had been carried out on horseback riding , which came across against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has ir@@ ref@@ uted mud on the leg , too . &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day for yesterday so what was that way .
it was also so on the race day .
Moody could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment of the pack at the race day . an investigation of this issue has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; said Moody . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Stor@@ m @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals for alleg@@ ations of claims
Melbourne @-@ Stor@@ m @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has cri@@ tici@@ zed cri@@ tique of the tactics of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League of the NR@@ L .
Sydney ro@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee of the Stor@@ m &apos;s players &quot; ring competitions &quot; allowed with his team during the high penalty victory in the qualifying session in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett made a little covered note to the Stor@@ m Team , after his team had won the final victory against North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; &quot; sample examples &quot; &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy distri@@ butes the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew and said they were concentrated in the Tac@@ tical , only on their &quot; &quot; touch &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers per team have hop@@ ed him , since it is pre@@ y that they worry about being be@@ aten from the Stor@@ m Team . &quot;
&quot; this always emerg@@ es again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fighting , when she met us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that in the whole year nothing has changed at our defensive system or the techniques . but over the last six weeks , we made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es at a real focus , and this has produced for us the division . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit shock for him . &quot;
it is already funny , as this is always up to this season . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Ben@@ net@@ ts idea from the &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds us of Ben@@ net@@ ts St George Ill@@ awar@@ ra &apos;s Dragons the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks about exciting football .
&quot; he was compared his game on Saturday night with our on Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a sh@@ it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and watch it exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have this kind of player .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they play . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger trust , because they say these things because they are a bit worried , to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago she was not thinking of us when it was the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Stor@@ m game against ro@@ dents brought a higher result than the game of bronze against Co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of bronze was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is it a s@@ exciting game ? &quot;
or are Pau@@ p and does not make any points a bit ton@@ ing ?
for me it is the sched@@ ules .
&quot; if they mention , it means that we will be in a phase still for them . &quot;
&quot; the Stor@@ m team has free this weekend since they have the right to receive either North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys , or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on next Saturday night at the A@@ AMI Park . ticket sales will start off the next Tuesday morning . &quot;
Ser@@ bian with US $ 200,000 deposit for drug @-@ cl@@ age
&quot; a man , that may possibly face a life @-@ long sentence due to his su@@ ction , to get hold of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that have been cor@@ ted to Queensland , was released at a deposit of 200,000 each . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ko Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested in the last month after the federal police took 100 kg of dro@@ pping at the Yacht Sol@@ ay , launched by South America over V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and launched in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed , as he met his co @-@ accused in the course of the afternoon and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse , where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially deadly punishment for the attempt to possess a commercial amount co@@ ca@@ ine , there was no evidence that he tried to possess the overall amount and that in the café from an inno@@ cu@@ ous reason could have been . &quot;
&quot; the judge on the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the flight threat to Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in case of a criminal off@@ ence , he held the police on its location . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and st@@ ep@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the statements made by the two people it is clear that the edition of a Security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ x@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from it , war@@ ned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released from deposit , under the conditions that he emig@@ rated to the Australian and his Ser@@ b pass , which holds daily at the police and stick to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

a pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the telephone of the girl who slept in an online mess@@ aging service that he received a number of in@@ decent images of children that were sent to him by another user .

&quot; H@@ og@@ g retained his police officers , that he did it , because it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ile on the internet , &quot; and then there was a polic@@ eman to be a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ or E@@ ili@@ dh Robert@@ son said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said , it would be a addi@@ ction that he was addi@@ c@@ ted to sc@@ are men . &quot;
&quot; he gave to that the searches were carried out on the computer by him , but he said it was done because he might pret@@ end to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ out a girl . &quot;
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more pictures .
he said that he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he is sick in his head , when he dro@@ wns , and said he would like to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Robert@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the tre@@ m@@ bling and the crying . &quot;
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computers and Play@@ station used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he did .

&quot; Secretary of Defense S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual perpet@@ rators , since one could argue that &quot; no ex@@ ual sexual element &quot; seems to be found in his understanding . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ m@@ ich@@ el is whether the judgment calls for October to get background report on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case , but was held in custo@@ dy for hear@@ ings to other cases in custo@@ dy custo@@ dy . &quot;

Stuttgart : run@@ ners from Tro@@ pen@@ stur@@ m &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest awaits
mete@@ or@@ ologists warn of the b@@ mb@@ s in the southwest of Mit@@ ter@@ och@@ afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area on Western Europe , warm sea lu@@ cr@@ ates currently warm sea lu@@ cr@@ ines into the country , shared the German weather service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart with . &quot;
&quot; the powerful back@@ casting was the run@@ ners of the trou@@ bles@@ ome &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; which was drawn over the Atlantic over the last few days from the Atlantic . &quot;
fier@@ ce storms and Stor@@ m are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , it is still on Thursday morning again in the Black Forest , on the Schwä@@ b@@ ish Al@@ b and in the Land @-@ sea , with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 km / hour . &quot;
the sun shows itself the sun again for a long time .
the mass does it : every two years show the high@@ points at the I@@ AA present its novel@@ ties .
&quot; in particular , it is particularly movement among the compact , which currently stands for sale . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently especially qu@@ eri@@ ed : around 28,@@ 1 per cent of the new appro@@ vals have been evaluated by force ( KBA ) in August on this segment .
this is also reflected in the I@@ AA ( General Public Days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept , and new top @-@ class models and luxury cars are presented in this year primarily a lot of new compact models . &quot;
&quot; the Opel Astr@@ a is one of the biggest premium car for the German auto industry , which will be at the deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astr@@ a is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel leader Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; thus the volume of the volume is also sold out well , the new Astr@@ a will not be much more expensive for this . &quot;
Rüssel@@ sheim / Melbourne . Opel represents an entry under the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euro . &quot;
the current Astr@@ a costs from 16 990 .
the Astr@@ a is available with a new 1.9 re @-@ l@@ iter engine with 74 kW / 100 hor@@ se@@ power .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen further supplies diesel and gas@@ oline engines of 70 kW / 95 HP to 147 kW / / 200 PS , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder engines . &quot;
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus there is the Opel Astr@@ a first just as fi@@ dd@@ lers .
&quot; as the second variant will follow in the spring of comb@@ i , who is also shown at the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what will drive to new compact cars next to the Astr@@ a on the I@@ AA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astr@@ a @-@ ri@@ vals Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
at the trade fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively as five @-@ fifth in a conventional and wide sporting GT version .
at the trade he will come early next year then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Q@@ eger will find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; it adap@@ ts to the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines fully into the mark of design . &quot;
the basic model will get a pet@@ rol motor with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but the supply is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 HP or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno who celeb@@ rates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model with gas@@ oline engines , including a newly developed 1,0 @-@ Liter @-@ Tur@@ bom@@ ach@@ or and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP . &quot;
the maximum torque is according to manufactur@@ er@@ dates at 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class emo@@ dell DS 4 that is seen at the I@@ AA . &quot;
outside the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Abl@@ eg@@ ers especially hand in front of the front part : here the cooling grill has been re @-@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights with LED technology was equipped .
&quot; in the interior , especially the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ation system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch@@ screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
added to the I@@ AA in the compact class a series of transitions and new varieties such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five square cell is human @-@ worthy
&quot; the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht has given a Ex @-@ prisoners in the T@@ egel of T@@ egel , which was placed in a small cell in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the infringement of their lives , prisoners have generally been entitled to financial compensation , when they are in too small cells . &quot;
that adopted the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht in a decision published on Wednesday .
those concerned may even hope for the judges even if they were det@@ ained only a few days in the premises of confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; thus an ex @-@ prison@@ er with his Constitutional Court was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in prison in Berlin @-@ t@@ egel between June and November 2009 , in a single cell with around five square meters , the toilet was spati@@ ally un@@ separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who according to his lawyer , was now back on the free foot in the meantime , moved to a larger cell . &quot;
his am@@ us@@ al off@@ ence due to the un@@ worthy prison terms of the country Berlin was failing .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Treaty ho@@ unds the judgment of the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ als in Berlin and taken the case to renewed test again . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s man viol@@ ates .
Kam@@ mer@@ court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even though for legal reasons of the fragile period only a few days of liability for the in@@ dem@@ nity was decisive , be an appeal was given . &quot;
otherwise &quot; a shor@@ tening of the legal protection of the personality would be to fear . &quot;
the Chamber of Ap@@ pe@@ als must now clarify the amount of money damage .
the constitutional fun@@ nel have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of prisoners in the past .
&quot; thus , they said only in April of a prison@@ er damage , because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; human un@@ worthy is considered to be a decision of 2011 as well as the maximum occupancy of a cell , without a separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court to agree with a in@@ mate in a parallel in November 2009 . &quot;
the then pl@@ ain@@ ting was held for three months a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons were also coming to the head@@ lines in recent weeks as well .
&quot; in this reason , prisoners are being shut down again and again for 23 hours , the aggression is rising , even on the tense situation , it is planned due to the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information on the judiciary be@@ zz@@ lement , 21 positions in the level are not occupied because of after@@ no@@ ons , 19 should not exp@@ ire . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to adopt them .
what is coming to Germany ?
&quot; about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Finance ( SD@@ P ) , according to the statement by vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrates determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I am saying again and again : we can do this and we create that . &quot;
&quot; in addition , what to do in Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; it is used for different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the federal state Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , every year - and for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; this is nearly twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) . &quot;
&quot; dramatically is the lack of living space but especially during the rented rental : 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing from the lease , and in order to apply these especially favorable apartments will also apply to refugees . &quot;
&quot; Ministry of Finance Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore intends to double the promotion , from currently 3@@ 518 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing annually , would have to arise and therefore , the federal government would have to invest an encour@@ agement of 6,@@ 4 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; scientists and federal minist@@ ries agreed that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction . &quot;
&quot; according to the estimates of the Institute of labour market and vocational research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the refugees can be engaged in employment in the long @-@ term . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , refugees would not be asked for their qualification in Germany to help them get started , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project man@@ ag@@ erin for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial to see whether they work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key for social contacts , for appreciation in the admission , but also for self @-@ esteem of the assignment &quot; , &quot; says Shi@@ r@@ isation researcher Diet@@ rich Thr@@ es@@ hardt . &quot;
according to hei@@ r@@ hardt Germany has given a political shift : from labour ban for refugees to recognition of work .
&quot; while earlier there was an employment ban for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced in November 2014 to three months , as well as the residen@@ cy , asylum seek@@ ers are limited to one place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour , it is highly recommended that refugees should be able to facilitate access to the labour market faster . &quot;
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing basic knowledge .
&quot; until now , there is no result of an offer on generic and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs most often be convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
the development of networks is therefore into view of the throne of the throne of the König@@ s@@ weg &quot; view .
&quot; the Berlin government administration has found that only a few fl@@ edged parents give their children to Kit@@ as , to sum up ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for those who come together , Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ able , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; yet to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management of hand@@ book in various languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators strongly rise by the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate seeks to increase the capacity of training - e.g. by driving more technical colleges . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students will be prepared without a knowledge of welcome in welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by instruc@@ tors who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; at them there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ ay from the Berlin administration . &quot;
the German Student@@ en@@ werk was estimated that about 20 percent of the refugees wish to study in Germany .
&quot; basically , no state asylum seek@@ ers or rejection the studies - the only exception was previously Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enk@@ el ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position . &quot;
studies of study could be facilit@@ ated to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a residence permit or dem@@ nity do not receive any services after the asylum @-@ performance Act , even if they commen@@ ce academic studies . &quot;
&quot; the latter still does not receive a BA@@ Fö@@ G , since they are not entitled to the circle of persons entitled . &quot;
&quot; toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1st January 2016 to shor@@ tens these spru@@ ce on 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing agreement must however be concluded , but Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; in future Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many is the religion important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should follow Islam succ@@ essi@@ vely the same rights as they have the churches , and to continue the existing state @-@ churches @-@ right to a new state of religions . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important for the creation of an Islamic welfare state , who takes care of the re @-@ pi@@ ds . &quot;
among the rights are also obligations .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of the Islam have to agree on clear contact persons and to co @-@ operate with the State in many fields , and will give him some control opportunities . &quot;
&quot; this also belongs to the willingness to face religious fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be registered to Germany too . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to choose such conflicts in Germany , have immediately their right , here to refuse , in Germany , he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law to Arab .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today an issue of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; this will also have to change the majority society , will the dismant@@ ling of discrimination and racism . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - for a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a general gender equality law .
&quot; but it becomes very slow , as the NS@@ U &apos;s series pointed , in which police and authorities were systematically ignored the rac@@ ist mot@@ if . &quot;
&quot; equal chances for all : what migrant organisations and stakeholders are a long time , and what international treaties such as the anti @-@ racial conspir@@ acy , will need to be realised in the next few years if the country is peaceful , and its new citizens should use its possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to medi@@ ate the anticipated refugees medi@@ cally , says An@@ z@@ t@@ ep@@ ics , Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; what Man@@ - Power and capacities are concerned , we create this , &quot; &quot; he said to the &apos; Tages@@ spiegel &apos; . &quot;
&quot; however , there must be extra money into the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls for all the deriv@@ atives immediately to be handed over to the registration of health cards . &quot;
provided services could later be b@@ illed to the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , so many people with the restricted performance catalogue that I see the asylum @-@ performance law . &quot;
else take the doctors above all to create language barriers .
&quot; before so far , the Berlin Health Sciences The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse than other patients than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in doctors &apos; doctors would have to be rep@@ lic@@ ated transl@@ ating them . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would also be helped with more general medical attention in emergency experts . &quot;
and with a different diagnostic view .
&quot; in refugee camps , for instance , there is significantly more untreated Dis@@ abilities , and in the young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with the partial other disease images , German doctors came from their training but clearly , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite stroke or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so hard to recognize . and what concerns the trouble @-@ shortage , either through the refugees may possibly even all@@ evi@@ ate in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have developed a highly developed educational system , several refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; to practi@@ sing practice , they must however show their qualifications and possibly be distr@@ acted again . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees in Germany an@@ tig@@ ational Physi@@ cs ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically is ill . most of them suffer from a post traum@@ atic load , or under depression . &quot;
&quot; in particular , be a refugee camp , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study of TU München claimed that each fifth Syrian refugee camps is traum@@ atis@@ ed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering from a post traum@@ atic proof @-@ proof , is suffering from among other things at so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respir@@ atory , ver@@ tig@@ o , heart @-@ har@@ es and death @-@ sc@@ ari@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms include dor@@ sal and concentration of concentration , strong sc@@ ary and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms were chron@@ ically , be a early treatment necessary , stated Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; until now , only four percent of the psych@@ o @-@ ill refugees have been given a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , psych@@ ic sick @-@ seek@@ ers can put an application for psych@@ otherapy , but the processing usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices mostly Sach@@ de@@ workers or doctors , which are not trained for psych@@ ic diseases , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion , &quot; the Circus was devoted to the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw any age group into the spell of fascinating acquisitions , wildlife and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus rehear@@ sed in the man@@ ege on the brick and was@@ p to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can not imagine without living my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie , animals and Jun@@ i@@ or@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current de@@ generation st@@ aging .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been proven in the hands of the family .
the gift to enth@@ use is the family thus in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their everyday reality and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; stresses 27 @-@ year @-@ old boy . &quot;
&quot; de@@ generation cock@@ tail with world @-@ vision &quot; , &quot; called director Reinhard rehear@@ st his concept . &quot;
50 cities of the nearly 3 000 kilometres long tour of the tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the cir@@ cus is convinced by talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the international Circus Festival of Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn Family draws the audience with wit and charm in her spell . &quot;
&quot; also , the Castillo Brothers understand their handi@@ craft . &quot;
with the heroes of the bonus films the Cub@@ an duo will take up .
light@@ ness and mot@@ ility - with these words identify them .
their humor@@ ous art on m@@ ast should conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus also captiv@@ ates with finger@@ tips and joint . &quot;
with the bike @-@ balance on a ball @-@ balance ?
for He Yuan no problem .
sn@@ ake men fascin@@ ate and fri@@ ghtened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascinated with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ anies mother , Brigitte . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of Circus are only too often the subject of various animal rights organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie has also a position on it : &quot; &quot; it is not good for our animals , it doesn &apos;t matter well . &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each str@@ ing@@ unit .
&quot; the four @-@ legged g@@ ari@@ sts &quot; &quot; as they are lovingly called , is the possibility to read every wish from the eyes . &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to be in the man@@ ege . &quot;
the highest commandment therefore : good for the animals provide .
&quot; specially to their z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land@@ pon@@ y@@ h@@ on and a z@@ ebra @-@ mare , the family is prob@@ able . &quot;
the two animals have lived in a pen eight years and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; she tells Brigitte . &quot;
&quot; while the z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus . &quot;
for each visitor a bit is likely to be part of it .
&quot; one is safe , &quot; says Steph@@ anie &apos;s rehear@@ se : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spect@@ ators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus invites 17 to 20 September daily at 5 pm and 8 pm .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 and 16 o &apos;clock .
&quot; Thursday is family days , for the presentation at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the ti@@ tu@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Zim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe ( German ) holds a false address in the parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , of Africa @-@ based guides , fired at the beginning of the year from a podium . &quot;
&quot; he remained in@@ ju@@ red , but the video of the case spread quickly across the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the parliament was also tou@@ ted by claims of the opposition , that they had anonymous deaths and war@@ ned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; last month they had f@@ ished him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the nation in parliament - this is speech , which he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions @-@ politicians SMS @-@ messages have received from their mobil@@ es that they were war@@ ned to b@@ other Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said the journalist according to model . &quot;
&quot; they war@@ ned the EP members that immunity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the parliament , parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; Chief spokes@@ man said , that the party of Morgan T@@ sv@@ ang@@ ir@@ ai , be &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for the politicians . &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard is building up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25.000 to 30,000 stations in the context of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP is later split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service service activities .
&quot; the expected job placement is leading to a loading of over 2,@@ 7 billion in the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive , which shall direct the unit after the separation . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise is becoming more small and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deeper portfolio of stores that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better placed than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion USD annual revenue and &quot; is focused on delivering un@@ reachable , integrated technology solutions for businesses , such as an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave , to produce electr@@ o @-@ plants and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage was named &quot; the birth@@ place of the Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring through to overcome the break from traditional PCs into mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the biggest US @-@ tech company , is the latest in this area that is based on the conviction that working closely focused on a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that teamwork has to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the ver@@ last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; she pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September and provided his rehabilitation after plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history it certainly is uncertain of his involvement in the next summer on the European Championship .
the great shame on this issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had stopped the last season after a separate ank@@ le hur@@ t@@ ment and then returned to his old swing during the off @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; it is a bone , that does not work well . &quot;
it is not a major concern .
this was only an accident .
it was not related to his k@@ nu@@ ckl@@ es or with the injuries that he had previously had .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical view , but like turning also , there is the related risk of further injuries , always when a player attempts to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
&quot; the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd received 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere , since his debut in six years ago . &quot;
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als ( 157 Lig@@ per ) in the last five game times .
&quot; the broader image of arsen@@ al is that they have been in six of eight game times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded the most offen@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury @-@ rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you will have a random period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and gain power . &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the Games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham hot@@ line next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns into a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to get a small sn@@ ap brake , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal are clear favor@@ ites , by group F drawing , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the players with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ be@@ aten after 41 Games , after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday night by an earthquake , being judged on the Ju@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the teaching from the past season with the Champions League of Monaco and will be pushed away from the distant hope , with his management to lead the club to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked on arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in the shop to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy @-@ show which gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up , now still dou@@ bt@@ less than ever before has proved to prove self @-@ murder among young men on a 15 year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important death thing for men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and there are three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ated ( calm - campaign against a miserable life ) 2015 than the year of the man , with the goal to ask the culture in question , the men hin@@ ders it to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to tackle this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 High School students with de@@ pressed symptoms presented that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with a healthy atmosphere , his chances of recovery has doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; of course , one only has to have friends so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of more than social media , with their focus on style about substance , the in@@ ability of answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to be strong , viable and successful to appear , doubles , even though in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists have extrac@@ ic values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more profound . &quot;
&quot; and as a Vide@@ og@@ ame @-@ invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that these focus was put on the head .
&quot; every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , caused by interaction as friend . &quot;
&quot; the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler @-@ frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football ground in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often stop their feelings completely to explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; like a staff of telephone care I told me : ... &quot; my audience play for people who feel depres@@ sive and self @-@ known , has really shown me how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old phrases &quot; I come right with &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , when talking about problems . &quot;
&quot; Friends is one of the shows , which come in mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ic mechanisms . &quot;
it is quite clearly presented to the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
thus much my objective out@@ sider on the phone the people at eye @-@ looking the desp@@ air also likes to get long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit at this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest to visit the day &apos;s celebration of completely re @-@ designed scenes why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k with you .
&quot; or , even better if you &apos;re sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give him a smile and say hello to him . &quot;
you never know which difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent at Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - all of 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
&quot; Mary hits to help PS@@ G to help , Malmö &quot;
angel Di Mary celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Sh@@ son Cav@@ ani after his hit on Malmö .
&quot; di Mary meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G , to Malmö . &quot;
here are the Game Report and reaction to the game .
angel Di Mary and Mr son Cav@@ ani held the course in Paris Saint @-@ Germain the Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against mal@@ m@@ ast in the Prin@@ c@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; Mary met less than four minutes after starting his Champions League de@@ br@@ is as PS@@ G players who brought the French Master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their prot@@ ru@@ sion as Cav@@ ani seen in the 6@@ 1st minute a head@@ room . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A , Paris also needs a strong start to the Swedish Master , since they are not only stri@@ ving the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ g rounds , but an improvement on the road to the quarter @-@ finals on each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic@@ s missed opportunities in front of the gate . he later started in play against his hom@@ etown team and against the club , with which he started his illustrations career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or up@@ lift@@ able in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to gain back 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and look relaxed , even though there are certain things we have to perf@@ ecting in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we have won , although I regret that we have not yet scored one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury to one of three modifications to the Paris Team , which could hold at its own place at Bordeaux on his own place at Bordeaux in the First League , but he was engra@@ ved in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine whis@@ per was called the man to bring the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he was transferred to Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why , when he entered the pas@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malmö &apos;s passport , before he finished to Johan Wil@@ and passing beautifully into the long corner of the court . &quot;
&quot; if however , someone believed that PS@@ G would win a big win , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off suggested to reach this level , joined with an@@ pi@@ ff with nine nation@@ alists on the field and has been a he@@ avier opponent in the middle field with a five @-@ man @-@ defence and two deep in the middle area . &quot;
&quot; but besides a kiss from Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who walk far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten at the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave itself on , with some mis@@ cell@@ ars and bad dis@@ closures , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was at no less than five clubs alone in the first half of which I was abandoned after the rest@@ art . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he pointed out a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c to the Di Mary in a turning point which was introduced by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the P@@ fo@@ sten . &quot;
the second goal was finally shortly after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay had thus scored his sixth end of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended up all the thought that Malmö could come back to the game , and only an excellent interference of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , was able to keep the end result , before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , Age Har@@ ley , announced that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , who did not have the same level . &quot;
the quali@@ fiers are not enough . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 Change to FC Bayern
world @-@ European and European Champion X@@ avi has played for Summer 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar
&quot; the FC Bayern stood obviously a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who at that time played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times of kno@@ ck@@ out champion , four times champion league , two times a world champion , two times Europ@@ r@@ enter , one time World Champion , the title @-@ list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the FC @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca betra@@ ys X@@ avi now , that he was already prior to the departure from Barcelona before the European Championship . &quot;
&quot; he said to me , that Bar@@ ça sell me for me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid won at that time everything , we told nothing . &quot;
and the registered members of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria .
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have . &quot;
&quot; to remember : in summer 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;

&quot; during a result of the Sunday night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when it stressed the need for alternative perspectives , and in relation to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about variety , then do it during the occupation of the film and not during the occupation of the show , &quot;
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked with animated un@@ belief and called &quot; hoo ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian itself . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown opened the Produ@@ c@@ un@@ enk@@ oll@@ egen Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers , to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I want to ask people to think about this - who will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a s@@ ut@@ te , be@@ aten from her white fe@@ eder . &quot;
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists of Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on re@@ te that their director would give us something we could not want .
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media have explo@@ ded before cont@@ ingent about Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter Users Mr Po@@ oni was op@@ pres@@ sive of the clip about the clip that he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in space , so he can explain its diversity - that is SO W@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 car@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time , in the exact racial representation in the media at the head of the social discussion . &quot;
&quot; after the te@@ ens Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement of Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter land@@ es@@ far effect and regulatory legisl@@ ator and authorities , discrimin@@ atory practices against colour content . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made an approach to the movement during the introduction of the nom@@ inated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums quiet , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , we still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leader of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter will have published an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hat@@ red group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the leader . &quot;

&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos;s first champion
&quot; professional sc@@ ath@@ ing and service assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first Ath@@ l@@ ete , who won the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which completed just their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season @-@ season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , until the finals . &quot;
&quot; to the last task , the climbing on one 75 feet long climbing rope was included in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; we ended the task within the period , with which he was the first Ath@@ l@@ ete which ended the exhau@@ sting phase 4 by American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , making it the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the tough winning victory , still under the shock about winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or had it to live , &quot; &quot; Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finals and why B@@ ritten , although he first ended the course at all , does not have any prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it will get the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed he receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he was n@@ urs@@ ed about this .
he has just done so happy what he did .
crowds of awards received his fans from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be be@@ aten from someone , then I am glad it is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think that Isaac would have felt like it , if they had changed the roles . &quot;

Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak at Minn@@ esota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit tiger .
previously they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball than today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last seat in the American League Central .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers reduced to their role as a comp@@ iler , but on Tuesday played this part perfect against Minn@@ esota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field . &quot;
the tw@@ ins are spar@@ ed a chance for Ascension within a game of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ Card .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return to the three letter F word which was so hard to capture over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad exc@@ l . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fredo Simon gave his early offensive support , as Detroit offered three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth day . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times to the 1 / 3 indoor and allowed three of us .
it was just his third successful start into his final nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ se@@ ye every game , and so I want to go focused in the game . &quot;
the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ erte Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hit and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since the middle of August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first tri@@ er hit @-@ game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Nav@@ al on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he did the heart@@ wood well @-@ w@@ rought , &quot; said Pas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at her ( whi@@ p training ) , looked much better in the bull@@ se@@ it , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns , at the end of the seventh interior , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game again . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton be@@ ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks placed a B@@ unt and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Lef@@ th@@ anded Bla@@ ins Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy ran , the only man who was confronted with whom he was confronted before the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied Rook@@ ie Miguel S@@ ano , who took a two @-@ run @-@ step by the right @-@ handed of Dre@@ w Tr@@ hagen to Two @-@ Run . &quot;
with a pair of run@@ ners and the finish @-@ run in the second brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ps to a Double Play .
it was the major league leading 27 times this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ps hit a double Play .
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth insight , the H@@ BI @-@ Double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ri@@ ght@@ stand st@@ ach is S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for its fifth stop . &quot;
Detroit pro@@ filed afterwards to the game of the game by an even moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers made three R@@ uns made in the first two inn@@ ings against the Ri@@ gh@@ th@@ anded Veter@@ an , who was painted before the game from the offen@@ ders , after having been missing for a back @-@ rest rather than a month . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt better than I was spot@@ ted and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches since in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; received while in the first den Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hai announced a single of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk on J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , which managed a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created its 0 @-@ 21 track series with the run@@ ners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , created another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , what the threat ended . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers launched in the second one @-@ out Double @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not take very well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
Hu@@ gh@@ es was situated in a pitch count that had no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ever ri@@ ver@@ ted A.@@ J.@@ A@@ ter .
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , it came to three R@@ uns and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez was divided because of a violation of the saus@@ age .
he studied Dr. James Andre@@ ws from Dr. James Andre@@ ws who graduated from San@@ chez in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ chez , since mid @-@ August on the viol@@ atory list due to a shoulder @-@ closure , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris from the offen@@ ding list is removed to start against the tw@@ ins . &quot;

&quot; I believe that thinking about military action , must not be held without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he threw the European states &quot; collective away . &quot;

the EU states have so far failed to agree on common action in the crisis .
&quot; the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting , for binding distribution of other 120 000 refugees . &quot;
&quot; given the strong refugee integration in Germany , the federal government wants to support the federal government with the first up@@ take and distribution of the people . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will post this in cooperation with the countries , announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ time consultations with the Prime Minister in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who want to protect against them . &quot;

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther Square
just under 500 years after the Reformation in Rome there is now a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther place .
&quot; in the presence of Stadt@@ pres@@ idents Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , on Wednesday a well @-@ known place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was bapti@@ zed on the name of the German reform . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; J@@ ens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the P@@ ä@@ p@@ est over centuries as a minority could live only in secrecy . &quot;
&quot; in symbolic terms , it is clearly visible that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k to the annual turn@@ around 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .

hammer artists inv@@ ests three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar called Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has posted the introduction and bent .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with su@@ mp@@ tuous pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Old , who was formulated in 150 moti@@ fs as well as from biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the respective topics is adjusted , that may well be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; over three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked in his bi@@ ble @-@ project for which he met a subjective artistic selection from the many subjects of &quot; &quot; Book of all books &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerged are cycles , which devote themselves themes such as Kreuz@@ weg , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or f@@ ather@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; this has spont@@ aneously fascinated by his partners : that applies to the Lu@@ ther Verlag with his the@@ ological alignment , as well as for the Kettler publisher with his focus on art books . &quot;
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost who spoke on the basis of painting with the respective Bible points .
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible presenting the &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; &quot; and so into the Today , into current circumstances &quot; . &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal levels of al@@ ts painting .
&quot; embedded between Martin Lu@@ ther &apos;s original bi@@ or@@ um from Martin Lu@@ ther , and each of the artist , who has formulated his very personal thoughts for the situation here . &quot;
the jewellery band has golden letters .
&quot; as allowed the 75 @-@ year @-@ old equal to a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were finally born at all the trigger for the bi@@ ble @-@ Project : Ot@@ mar Old , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belong to the strict Protest@@ ant rulers . &quot;
&quot; since the education is already done with the pipe , &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work up , so that maybe even to carry me with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is that art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time is again high @-@ evident : &quot; the perception of sculp@@ tors is made today of advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is given down .
artists have a different desire and bl@@ iss to show things .
pictures have always a bit of secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt aims to let the observer have taken up the pictures , &quot; they let themselves discover , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for his object . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost begins on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art . &quot; I like how he understands his own lives . &quot;
&quot; I did not make sure to fully grasp the Bible , but selected for him important , also mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely describes &quot; . &quot; created a paintings @-@ Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Lu@@ ther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler &apos;s language of love and responsibility .
some of the origin@@ als - paper and can@@ v@@ ents - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
construction for BM@@ X @-@ rail seam@@ lessly
&quot; plans made , place found , companies commissioned , Earth @-@ hill for a round course : one year later everything was done almost everything - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railways this was a conclusion . &quot;
&quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration with care for displ@@ aced persons , especially among the inhabitants , who did not toler@@ ate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so , hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will take place in October , the first council of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck now in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should be started without &quot; &quot; more memorial &quot; &quot; with the works at the former Hall@@ en@@ bad . &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees from 2019 to 2019 : Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign in the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; football is re@@ acted to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its policy to overcome its aid in tackling the problems . &quot;
&quot; I think this is the greatest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; in principle no one can say , that doesn &apos;t matter , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interesting every single person to get a handle on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ Chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and catch the head of the President , Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; since the topic is certainly a central role , &quot; announced it . &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
but the crucial past@@ ure has to place the policy .
the German Football Association therefore has expanded its refugee &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome to four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some Bundes@@ liga support this programme .
already this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ del@@ eine will set a clear sign when they will be on the left Tri@@ kot@@ z@@ mel instead of the usual regular sponsor@@ ing logos ( Her@@ mes ) the printing process &quot; We help - # Cl@@ es@@ welcome . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; said Lever@@ k@@ ens Sport@@ boss Ru@@ di V@@ ö@@ ller &apos;s &quot; photo &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a &quot; &quot; matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee @-@ drama goes every day , none may be taken away . &quot;
&quot; we can use football fans , no , we must use our exposure to help our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already so incredibly u@@ pri@@ ght , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ unvei@@ hei@@ ms General Manager Peter Ret@@ d spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to the EM @-@ Quali@@ fication game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach describes the support of refugees as a &quot; great collective work in German football . &quot;
that all 36 Lic@@ ence have launched its own projects is great .
just as great is that small and smallest compar@@ isons are active .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; , &quot; that we spent , will live in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this and the next year , the association jointly with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government will be at the disposal of 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the insurance companies have already announced the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ Pres@@ er@@ ef loses an eye in the accident
&quot; the President of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye for several reports , according to the overthrow in early July . &quot;
&quot; when an accident at the stair@@ way in the house of his brother in the US he had fallen after midnight on a water tum@@ bler that he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; economic week &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost embarrass@@ ed , was impot@@ ent , has then out to@@ wed out onto the road - it told us this last week , &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder H@@ asso Platt@@ ner . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go his work out .
&quot; beginning of October we meet in front of the board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Plat@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year old manager was therefore full of work and is full of work . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; ( Thurs@@ days ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to run the software groups . &quot;
&quot; I am fully here for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I stood in a regular contact with the Super@@ visory Board and its chairman H@@ asso Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes usually between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP Head@@ quarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; whether it &apos;s important to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen so much . &quot;
&quot; important is to be re@@ plen@@ ished , when you go . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ spare pilot magn@@ ets besides skir@@ m@@ ish ...
&quot; Prus@@ sia flour@@ ished an appropriate photo and explained that he suffered the violation , while he was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot;
he therefore comes into operation in Singapore at the weekend as little as a reservoir for the two pedi@@ gree Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and Jen@@ son button in@@ ask how a week later at the Great Prize of Japan .
football : BV@@ B without re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : wheat bri@@ ghter in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all the hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League will finally be destroyed . &quot;
the National @-@ player is also missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well as in du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether to be there on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ oriented game against Lever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach will be open : &quot; we expect to return from him to the training session on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his anc@@ est@@ ries at the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change at the door @-@ carrier .
so Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the seat of tri@@ ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football @-@ teacher the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller arrives in the future in all Europa League games , however , Tu@@ ch@@ el would be open . &quot;
with high prob@@ abl@@ ity he will also argue the second game .
&quot; the for@@ them@@ ed statement of fellow @-@ players Re@@ us that the Fin@@ der suit for the BV@@ B in the Europa League has its target , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l holds for understandable : &quot; therefore Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants to take the lead in Germany
Germany must be fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner after the will of the German government on the change of the car in technological edge .
&quot; the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , decided on Wednesday a Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things sees investments in the development of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in Wednesday , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; new mobility . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated , net@@ worked driving will increase the road safety and worry for less jams , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with representatives of the industry on the I@@ AA . &quot;
the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier of the Department of Commerce empha@@ sizes among other things the importance of mobile broad@@ band construction and a fast moving on digital radio .
the testing of new technology currently creates a test track on motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; to allow the driver to be liable for any additional risk of the defect , the German government wants to examine the legal framework and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use internationally for the per@@ missible maximum speed for self prop@@ elled cars at 10 to 130 km / hour . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also wants to push for a change to the Vienna Convention , which has so far only seen the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; while automated driving takes over in increasing the car the guidance , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in a matter of seconds .
&quot; following the study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , high@@ ways on motor@@ ways to 2020 can be technically feasible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , driving vehicles on public roads are to be expected only far to 2020 . &quot;
&quot; added value in the area of the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions , in Germany , the authors of the study value over 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ traffic police spokes@@ man Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the security of personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
still the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars remain scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; one on Wednesday at the AA institute on behalf of the For@@ sa @-@ Institute on behalf of the EU@@ for@@ gan@@ ing decre@@ es comes to the result that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous vehicles will come through in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect from it at all , 31 percent do not believe in it . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of the surv@@ ey@@ ed up to 2025 with aut@@ on@@ om driving cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; according to a collection of digital association , Bit@@ k@@ om , only seven percent would agree to complete control over the whole journey on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway that would be at least 15 percent in flowing traffic , in St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances to the car .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and a triple start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; the Düsseldorf , Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to stand up with the cover from 25 September to 4 October only in the single . &quot;
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning .
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without a jump to the title , &quot; said Federal trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ ler during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; this time , B@@ oll was still on the flight to a long term rate of sponsorship in China at this time . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected to come back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are now no longer like a clear Favor@@ it , &quot; declared single @-@ European representatives Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the S@@ etz@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also reminded of the European Championship 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at the time , Timo was missing and we are Europ@@ am@@ masters . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , we should orient@@ ate ourselves , explained the world @-@ fifth . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a Wach@@ s@@ men Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : window man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which , thanks to video proj@@ ections are sc@@ ary human . &quot;
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer who was caught among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as St@@ nen@@ out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and therefore he put men into skir@@ ts .
&quot; I can no longer say today that I am En@@ f@@ ant with the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it used to be quite easy , now it &apos;s real &quot; , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( Out of the side@@ walk on the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from 18 September at the Kuns@@ thalle the HY@@ PO @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the Mo@@ des@@ pot@@ ters have changed his early attitude to a show about his personality . &quot;
&quot; actually he had been against it , because , &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit to death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection was already done in Montreal in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just lovely clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits bearing an insight into the very poorly acting work of the man who has written the story , without ever having to have education . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically is not structured the presentation , but it is a great chore@@ ographi@@ es overall plac@@ eable , for which much effort was operated : to m@@ b the doll@@ s , for example , a sty@@ list was involved . &quot;
14 tons of material made the movers according to information of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October @-@ set there was still a special treat : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen @-@ out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; women &apos;s showers as men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ ti@@ ers &apos;s old Ted@@ dy is seen in the exhibition .
&quot; it stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ tious mo@@ ist en@@ dow@@ ment of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football , he was attracted to his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
playing with a pupp@@ et and his parents would not have allowed him .
designing fashion he then joined himself later on .
he resign@@ ed fashion journals and looked at the designs of other designers who told Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
but later I bought this then naturally .
for his first own fashion show he have not able to pay the Models .
&quot; they got nothing , they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
&quot; formerly , it went to the long ro@@ ider@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; the clim@@ bed substances and points emerged in large quantities for customers , who used them for example to blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of g@@ desp@@ air Pl@@ auen . &quot;
instead the fashion is again important .
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , Fashion played a larger role , was then squee@@ zed by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry that accessories such as bags and in regional traits .
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage @-@ mode , which lean into past styles , an increasing number of contractor . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , who is not serving in the textile sector in Germany is no longer the market . &quot;
with us they already have half of all orders .
Mo@@ desp@@ air Pl@@ auen is together with nine other companies member in the branch of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they must have the protected label .
&quot; over the last 15 years , approximately 80 percent of the sales revenues were abandoned . &quot;
private stores and also the wholesale there are almost no more .
our products can hardly achieve our products on this way .
the mass market is made much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively on chains .
&quot; atten@@ de@@ es the export , currently to Russia and to the USA . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association is also trying to score points through environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer was explained by embro@@ ider@@ y in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year , we have a seal of quality that shows us to produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this relates to the used materials . &quot;
thesis U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Snow@@ mobil@@ es Academy of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tops .
&quot; to continue the competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that takes time and courage .
&quot; a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and businesses , who must think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base . &quot;
a couple of years ago Tex@@ tile mills Kat@@ i Re@@ uter &apos;s historical snow @-@ point .
thereby the machine leads into some places of small chic@@ ks .
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ smith &quot; Bianca Hall@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ches led himself to this , &quot; previously I could not start anything with traditional lo@@ ener . &quot;
now she uses the snow @-@ tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process they character@@ iz@@ es the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and Finland - primarily to customers whose ancestors had lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings , and who like to have a reminder . &quot;
&quot; as a result , I see my jewelry as the modern ad@@ ors of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; Film

&quot; but it &apos;s noisy &quot; &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; &quot; but not a new continuation , but about a kind of continuation , which takes 20 years after the first film with the magic n@@ anny . &quot;
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world crisis in England .
who plays more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .

XI ur@@ ges him to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy has to open wider outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping at the Tuesday of a group , was commissioned with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should devote to this to foreign investment and know @-@ how , and to improve the strategies for business relationships , &quot; he said in an address in the 16th session of the central leadership group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promote new ups and further reforms will bring about new impetus and vitality and provide new place for economic growth , &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the executive group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list of regul@@ ating the market entry , complete the border controls policy , promotion of government organizations ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the inhabitants of Mel@@ des@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; following statement , a negative list will be created , the sectors and companies identified that will not be questioned . &quot;
the system will gradually be tested and improved by testing programmes .
&quot; the initiative is of importance because the market has a greater role in the ingredient of resources , ensures a law @-@ based business environment and designed the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ wered controls over the powers granted to companies and make sure companies decide how they do their business .
&quot; the statement also stated that China borders will permit , to explore new models of cross @-@ border business cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;
&quot; as part of an offer , state controlled controlled sectors , other areas will open for private investment . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will provide the legitimate interests of foreign co @-@ financing companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for a foreig@@ ner to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by facilit@@ ated the requirements and the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and engage in professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Premier Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , was reported in one after the statement published . &quot;
EU wants to double cross @-@ sil@@ ber border in be@@ asts
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large be@@ asts and consumers with it a significantly higher dose of nerve exploitation .
&quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which is a corresponding working @-@ paper of the EU , cri@@ tici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side effects associated with spon@@ ge and inf@@ ants , explained by Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt are supposed to reveal the threshold of the nerve toxic for large fish at the end of the food chain as about Hai@@ der or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; &quot; on one to two milli@@ gram mer@@ cury , per kil@@ og@@ ram of fish . &quot;
&quot; big rob@@ bery @-@ fish , however , are already so heavily charged with mer@@ cury that are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the existing threshold values , about 50 percent of the str@@ ands . &quot;
&quot; after the dou@@ bling of the threshold values , only 14.8 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this relaxation , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the threshold values among other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram mer@@ cury per kil@@ og@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; however , Food@@ watch lists this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller gra@@ y@@ fish , such as carp mostly were so low , they already respect the planned peak value today . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ dic@@ ation in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ery of the distr@@ action , which helped itself the economy &quot; , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ cury is a high @-@ toxic sword for man , which above all across the food chain in its exploitation . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; already low amounts are caused particularly when dis@@ inf@@ ants of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the German Ministry of Environment explains its homepage with regard to the current top values , but that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
Mer@@ cury is first obtained through coal burning in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information by the German Federal Ministry of German Federal Environment ( German Federal Government ) Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock had more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of one in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of Mer@@ cury in fish approximately in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and nation@@ wide crossed , &quot; had the &quot; mirror &quot; quoted from the paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings carried away from Mer@@ cury in fish already among the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ SF@@ F . &quot;
Food@@ watch calls consumers for protest against the plans of the EU on : www.@@ qu@@ eck@@ sil@@ ber @-@ guard .
