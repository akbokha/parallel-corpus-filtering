Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not particularly friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Tehran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement construction of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal by Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship of the two . &quot;
&quot; in March Net@@ any@@ ahu was held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partly as aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , he conf@@ esses his friend , shot dead &quot;
&quot; in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b told the police that he shot his girlfriend , and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; it was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officers found the dead body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand @-@ written note that was cut to a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who loved me . &quot; &quot; this was written by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lam@@ b . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , has already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ tec@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lam@@ b made the fatal emergency call at some point .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : Lam@@ m took his life , when the police beat him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting in the university , students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what lam@@ bs motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details contained by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students told us that they were joy@@ ful for his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said , he has no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lam@@ b in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty consists of 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations to problematic behavior . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lam@@ b praised , said he was too excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lam@@ m told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;

&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lam@@ b had worked so hard for him , would not be a guarantee for an automatic road to a position as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lam@@ b can no longer answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police found a track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he was arrested , Lam@@ b killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ m went to this house , but Johnson said that he believes he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , Lam@@ b began his work at the University of 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he took a doctor@@ ate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ m was 20 , when she met together with friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool old guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
&quot; at that time , he was the flock of women . &quot;
&quot; all girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lam@@ b said , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends stayed and had a daughter that was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lam@@ b , but due to his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played blues . &quot;

later they played one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lam@@ b had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ica . &quot;
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and gro@@ unded each other .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of sh@@ ear . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Fr Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .

&quot; associated Press Auth@@ ors Emily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lam@@ b had shot the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that Lam@@ m called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me was empty , and it gradually became clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;

UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s strengthened military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution , &quot; the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief calls again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integ@@ rative negotiations to find a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France , to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ tt@@ ed that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers were in@@ separ@@ able .

* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
some have tried to brand him as a flo@@ p .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans attempt to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys below , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national poll@@ s showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the Real Estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at this time Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was given leadership to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , of whom none of them won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ umps staying power and begin to flow their dollar to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values indicating that the Real Estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul positive . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
now six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week found that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in a survey conducted by CNN / ORC last week 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they would either &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republican voters say they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans see Tr@@ ump &apos;s temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bomb@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters tend to believe that the Real Estate Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think he has the personality of a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively manage his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament is not going to the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republican voters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the idea .
&quot; if they put their money hats , republi@@ can voters reject Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey by CNN / ORC from the past week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump was the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since the time , when four of the end of July spent their money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot;
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at that time last cycle , four of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered to collect another candidate , Tr@@ ump hits almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ umps &apos;s leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed over more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republican candidates , Tr@@ ump is harv@@ esting majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ es and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypothetical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a brief majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have made their opinion .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; of course it can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dr@@ umps are strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump called in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; was the immigration turning and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse on 2016 . &quot;
some are worried that the bomb@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump is decisive Hez@@ bollah @-@ Americans from the Republican Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; as long as the immigration in the spotlight remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do so . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s up to new high@@ s .
&quot; on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ der status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines &apos;s Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ strated about the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ factory &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;

the good news : the risk of reducing the risk is reduced .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results in a long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;

s &amp; Ds call for zero tolerance on exploitation of workers
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to resolve the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement .
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which is reflected in its way considerably more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that the citizens trust , &quot; &quot; stated the responsible Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Mal@@ m@@ ström . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposes to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone is to emerge with 800 million people . &quot;
the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings relate specifically to the fact that the EU states and the United States have jointly selected independent judges for a new investment decision .
&quot; they are supposed to come to the same parts from the EU , the United States and from third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , there is also a second instance . &quot;
it would allow it to rise against jud@@ g@@ ments .

&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns is expected to debut at the launch of the Prime Minister with tension . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is to announce his debut at the launch of the Prime Minister and for the first time with David Cameron .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six pre @-@ given questions shortly after noon , and his performance from the media is likely to be scrut@@ ini@@ zed by the media and the Labour MPs . &quot;
he demanded &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C conference on Tuesday .
&quot; meanwhile , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them at a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been &quot; &quot; in resp@@ ectable silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns shadow cabinet , Owen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; from his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ part of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party was originally supported as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspondent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked within Labour &quot; , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation on profits . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference said that Labour &apos;s changes , in order to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether . &quot;
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions secretary , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he has been T@@ ory leader , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says he has given &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions of Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP said that the launch of the Prime Minister is a confrontation , and that it will be subject to serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economy minister , will represent him when he is not part - for example , if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also taught the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; cas@@ per@@ le theater &quot; , &quot; which is often associated with the launch of the Prime Minister . but some years later he added that he failed in it . &quot;
&quot; since it was first sent on television first in 1990 , the group with the prime minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ omet@@ re of the ruling part of a leader and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argue that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

Met@@ cash attempts to protect the I@@ GA branches in front of an al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash has launched a land campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA reta@@ iler in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA stores and sell shop@@ ke@@ epers , selling tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will be published more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholesale reta@@ iler for food , alcohol and devices passes its annual investors strategy day . &quot;
&quot; it is much on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the East states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 per cent in the eastern states . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis club Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the short@@ est storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; prov@@ oked by the not@@ orious controversy of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters into the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ees , with Har@@ rison called out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis bat , after a cra@@ mp@@ f managed a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in Davis Cup semi @-@ finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I &apos;m quite en@@ vy is the fact that after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi has gone a little into the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a var@@ ic@@ ose in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from Fr@@ ust himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he really beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather provoc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 years old , he works very hard , and he has never been a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os in the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term firm . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es round around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he climb@@ s into the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions . &quot;

&quot; Hungary declar@@ es the emergency stand and kept the south border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all those who tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indig@@ nation . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck in a land strip on the street between the two control points of the country , and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations rose .
&quot; as a police helicopter flew over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; Open the Border &quot; &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian pro@@ stitution police . &quot;
some referred to protest food and water .
&quot; the Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence of the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc on a controversial meeting in Brussels failed to agree on a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the corrupt Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU countries would eventually receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria urged the European Union special summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
&quot; but Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a bal@@ m action from Brussels or its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the emergency stand in two southern regions gave authorities more authority to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a barb@@ ed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having finished a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison races were used to create the barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; in recent months Hungary , for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the entry point into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most incoming business refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , among them Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which took effect at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high za@@ uns that the government left along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es emergency state , &quot; &quot; said spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree with the implementation of the military , which is expected for next week , but reporter from Associated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Land Security Advisor for Or@@ ban , said that 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come up by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of accused of crimes according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are trying to repair the fence swi@@ ft@@ ly .
&quot; Hungarian officials included two of the seven border cros@@ sings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with barb@@ ed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to handle the data of people and pressed a crowd to push themselves there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded to enter , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to go to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gains ground . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he will channel for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ election elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more constant than those of the other candidates .

&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has escal@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton still has a big advantage in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was facing S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the elections nationwide say that they would support Clinton , if they were nominated by the party . &quot;

maybe not surprising that Clinton &apos;s latest supp@@ orter is particularly impressed by her .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republican voters are saying this about their nickname Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
consent to deal with problems and vot@@ ability are also cited .
&quot; since the Vice @-@ President proposes a potential for the presidential office in the Wa@@ ag@@ mire , 57 percent of the democratic voters will see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the tip . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of Democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead is increasing from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure declined by 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds have risen by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important for a candidate , the Democratic voters call questions about vot@@ er . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , there is no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters as un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidate will bring good results in some important characteristics by voters in the elections of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are regarded as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds are best cutting off with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about Hillary Clinton are using a personal email address and a server during the term as foreign minister , most of the Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say they have not affected their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 per cent said that their opinions had deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by voters of their party as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less than in May . &quot;

three Constitutional Complaints Lo@@ dged Against the Minimum Wage Act In@@ admissible
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a Shi@@ kan@@ ous Rit@@ u@@ als of a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five people will be submitted . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; &quot; Michael &quot; &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to hospital , which has contributed to his death , distributed the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he had been bur@@ dened with sand with a 30 pound back@@ pack , and repeatedly attacked , while he tried to go over a frozen field to a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and were supposed to wait for an hour before they brought him into a hospital so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to make his symptoms to goo@@ geln and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at that point , the members of hiding uten@@ sils began to hide and set the well @-@ being of the br@@ otherhood on the principle of &quot; &quot; Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ tec@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning in his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was added with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , hull and th@@ ig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; at least one student dies since 1970 every year at the Sch@@ ik@@ anen , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe received an accus@@ ation due to the murder of the third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
&quot; two and thirty members of Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for illegal attacks and education of a criminal organization . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to blame only the persons involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or in@@ official - this has been sanc@@ tioned , we will also be able to hold this accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; an interest increase comes , and the hous@@ eses are advised to rise , ren@@ ders for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only low guidance for the economy . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , albeit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when they start to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; contrary to that , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no impact . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , interest increases can make things more vol@@ atile for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that asset yields 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what has happened after interest increases in F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to appear later in the profitability cycle , and the return begins to decrease . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that could not happen before and which could accelerate the recession . &quot;

&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent . &quot;

&quot; market participants enjoyed the whole year to a rise in interest in the F@@ ed , and all the eyes were directed at the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ended on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the cycl@@ ones from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing swing in GDP and before @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights were set up very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is 74 months . &quot;

&quot; the main difference is that the effect on bond issues is faster than when stocks , if they change their strategic direction . &quot;
&quot; in bonds , the ren@@ ders seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle is done . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the profitability cycle , the bond returns immediately dropped , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer ties between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a diver@@ gence of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fixed Income Analyst at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adjusted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the earnings curve is fl@@ atter , credit cl@@ amping has increased and vol@@ atility has risen - all the features of the market , if the F@@ ed shar@@ pen@@ ed its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and large enterprises , companies that wra@@ ps the larger part of their business operations in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debt are becoming worse , as a growing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also finance their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; said Goldman Sach@@ s analyst in a report for the customer . &quot;

&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Speaker Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel because of his &quot; corruption &quot;
he argues that he is not to be distinguished from commercial rivals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said they were only im@@ itated by The Br@@ its
&quot; the voice of the Parliament , Dam@@ ien Collins , attacked the voice of the voice and said that this is not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading member of the parliamentary committee and raises new pressure on the transm@@ itter , to prove that he does not do what the private broad@@ caster does not do . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; double &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial rivals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also focused on the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , appear to be The Br@@ its just under another name . &quot;
&quot; so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontane@@ ously @-@ called examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC general director rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 went far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and give new works on behalf , I really think it &apos;s important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to work than it did in the past because the British were less informed than classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which , during the hearing of the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports , was under fire to get the commercial rivals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins , The Voice an - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for estimated cost of £ 22 million . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show was produced with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Richter - &quot; on a particular BBC fashion . &quot;
&quot; he added that he wants the company to &quot; &quot; find a hit from our own stable &quot; , &quot; if it is the next time an entertainment series . &quot;

the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first burial site in Mek@@ ka through the streets
Saudi Arabia places the collapse in part of the giant Saudi Bin Laden group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed , &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were buried in the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession went over to the Sac@@ red site , where only days before a building crane collap@@ sed by the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for funeral , when the Saudi King passed over the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the catastrophe that also left 3@@ 94 injured . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 operators , who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed by the Great Central mo@@ j@@ ee Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram came out of Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to help the Kra@@ n . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca with thousands , which will continue to come to the city , will continue . &quot;
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group , did not have to stand the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree , published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the leadership of the company is prohibited abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man praised what caused the fall of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden group has not issued any statements about the collapse de Cran@@ s , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal decree also t@@ ad@@ led the group for not up @-@ to @-@ date safety measures and because they did not co @-@ operate with met@@ eor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project led by Bin Laden group .

&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was kidn@@ apped by the family in the 1990 @-@ he years . &quot;
&quot; the fall of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions of the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in life of any healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
government representatives ordered that one million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) to the relatives of the killed are to be paid and the same amount of permanent injured .
other injured will receive half of this amount .

he has been acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the Attorney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation was cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the def@@ endants were able to disp@@ ense funds from associations between 2006 and 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes . &quot;

it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; for the failure of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence is that the association at no time has been created at any time . &quot;

&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he then decided to take this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have shot money to lay our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot;

&quot; therefore , package and non @-@ detail entries seemed to be explained , the former Ob@@ server explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings accounts were administ@@ ered jointly by the two accused , the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the with@@ draw@@ als of the association were not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in the details of the financial b@@ ail@@ out , so the answer is important . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;

&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he was killed and killed by his colleague , Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could not do it &quot; , &quot; the authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lam@@ b , professor of geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 am Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , he shot a man and killed someone . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I am afraid of my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the call for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lam@@ b gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police saw the scene they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lam@@ b , 45 who said : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it . &quot;
I loved Amy and she is the only woman I ever loved .
&quot; after writing the note , Lam@@ b passed 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing him before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lam@@ b claimed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was married about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter that is 19 , and she is &quot; &quot; destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lam@@ b for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot;
&quot; the police said Lam@@ b called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he &apos;s not going to jail . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , Lam@@ b drove his car to the side , fled to the forest , and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in spring 2015 , Lam@@ b received a doctoral degree from the Delta State University , as his life lo@@ oms on the university &apos;s website . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven &apos;s Champions League defeat at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left outside def@@ enders to we@@ eping and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg fra@@ ction and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
&quot; in the locker room , he had an oxygen mask . &quot;
he w@@ ept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months will take , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape a red card and a penalty of a penalty .
&quot; Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , hasn &apos;t pen@@ alized the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ rator had mistaken himself .
they can judge for themselves if I say that a penalty and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; &quot; thank you for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I get stronger back . &quot;
&quot; in this respect , Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the PS@@ V defeat &quot;
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK def@@ ender has an additional incentive to recover until next June . &quot;
&quot; Philli@@ p Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; if a player leaves this kind of injury to the place , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup in 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball coming into another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m sorry .

surely David Cameron doesn &apos;t know Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost completely . &quot;
it is because you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 , decided to use Dr. Se@@ uss &apos; environmental f@@ abel . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it seems always to give a picture or a message we have missed . &quot;
&quot; everything beautiful and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is allegedly describing the story of the book , re@@ stores a summary of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , meets the girl of his dreams , fulfilling her desire to see a real tree , &quot; reads one . &quot;
&quot; as if this would not be susp@@ icious : the text of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the Internet Movie Database , begins and begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Vil@@ le , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is admitted to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is the story of the book so little familiar . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for twenty times a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral bure@@ au .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exp@@ ul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , it is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res who selected England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not shown on my map . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks website may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not bear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown magnitude on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; this message : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the England test cad@@ res , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ quet players are aligned with results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I told this - players are their own best sel@@ ectors . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one could have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully hits further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even though he didn &apos;t get so good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test perc@@ us@@ sion@@ er receives to set his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can lift was that England first put Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a striking man that I este@@ emed highly . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket@@ player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which was very much met . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same odds as those before him , but this depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to leave Mo@@ een next to Cook , giving a extra spin bow@@ ler and get four qui@@ cks , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a devil @-@ sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my previous te@@ amm@@ ate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
&quot; he has made three hundred steps immediately , and did not look back . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the ca@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited way of dealing with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people possibly see their statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made a few clever additions to the trainer staff . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , as he played under all conditions and against all the attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in changing rooms , even if the messages are consistent with the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; my team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team actors do not determine the timet@@ able . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
&quot; the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain access to Zul@@ u if the economy reaches up to 2017 in a no@@ isy , &quot;
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ commented novel strategy to hold Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ acy friend said recently that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of its own fault , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive contrac@@ tual changes that they usually don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual general meeting that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit meeting or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of yourself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who looking outside the UK inside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has happened in the exagger@@ ated long @-@ standing like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his substitution in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland probably soon has a nationalist right government , Spain a left wing . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they are going to pull out a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , some such ministers may even deliberately not possibly provide helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ end@@ um campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the new trial was a P@@ lei@@ te &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the re@@ trial . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense , and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did not have been inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , who supported our entrance 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspondent in the early 90 @-@ he years . &quot;
&quot; in all of his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sh@@ arks , telephone @-@ hack@@ ers foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners who have most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Tony Blair thought similar about her , but noted that when one sits with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him , rather than to become his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ ans than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums , because Blair was opposed the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which was then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot;

&quot; but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cle@@ ap on Monday in West@@ minster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any time for me to waste his time - seems to be in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 years , an error at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I just press it friendly - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional bl@@ ur@@ ring trend and the wil@@ dly skir@@ mis@@ h of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ England can certainly say yes . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on TV this week said when the boy sc@@ outs in him fought not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s nom@@ ination of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ er years , when his old father sat on television to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cabinet colleague , without losing too far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight for &quot; under any circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow workers and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touch @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and especially in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a bro@@ od @-@ site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , allowing him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the campaign campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite siege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among lef@@ tist dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign to exit , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin go to political capital - they have also susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be all point@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost @-@ lowering of the T@@ ory government on the power of which I was reminded of something about the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum on Monday . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on E @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) included Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; PH@@ E published the &quot; &quot; Prin@@ ciples Report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; in the last month &apos;s medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y basis , &quot; based on the PH@@ E , was based on his most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria decision analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to introduce their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;

&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants agreed to get funds from an E @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he had received after reports previously by Philip Morris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ um are not provided , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champions , some of which also provide an industry @-@ financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , PH@@ E was also involved . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; however , no such connections or restrictions are discussed in the PH@@ E report . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at PH@@ E , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking causes the National Health System $ 2 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear provision of current evidence that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national competence . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; the former leader of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to do the type of programs , which are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC that they are public @-@ law programs that are likely to be viewed by a smaller audience , in hard conten@@ tious time window against the most popular shows of their rivals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried for six years at Channel 4 without success , with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent out , which would also be clearly presented by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; &quot; said Johnson the Upper House Communication Committee on the Future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I mean medium or long term does not hold for a good idea , you should at least give up his production at least on programs that do not make or put on behalf . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it is non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm . &quot;
I have to see how this is to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC inno@@ c@@ ence on the hunt for reviews is &quot; &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the public , but they fulfil their tasks , and they may argue if they are able to justify their apparent missions to justify 4 billion Swiss radio fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
&quot; they put them into a time window , in which nobody wanted to see them . &quot;
&quot; on the radio fee , Johnson said the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of you think that you get a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of BBC production would be officially classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and they should be informed , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain themselves in public television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a handful of television are shown , and enter the commercial channels to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
&quot; the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction at the moment , in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses . &quot;
bacteria of the@@ Y@@ ers@@ ini@@ agen@@ us el@@ ic@@ it intestinal wall@@ inflamm@@ ation@@ and serious diarr@@ ho@@ eal disease as well as other afflic@@ tions in humans . this gen@@ us includes th@@ ep@@ la@@ gue path@@ ogen .
&quot; the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction at the moment when they have sound impul@@ ses that have high frequencies for human ear hearing , to be heard . &quot;
&quot; the impul@@ ses work by switching off Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels , which respond to ultrasound waves . &quot;
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impul@@ ses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani states that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves that then penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such as a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ emat@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically changed the worms so that some of their mot@@ ions are TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels . &quot;
&quot; if ultrasound turns ultras@@ oun@@ ds to altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transmit into the worms , where they turn off the changed mot@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be revealed in an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from top to the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily susp@@ end the affected human neur@@ ons temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
&quot; 11 years ago , I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints over others . &quot;
most I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance to student resi@@ dences is from slightly annoying to fri@@ ghtening up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken sab@@ bath year , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in the serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to figure out the people you like in contrast to those you wouldn &apos;t speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burnt and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people often turn into drinks @-@ recep@@ tions , film @-@ night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract themselves and acc@@ entu@@ ate their under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; in relation to this , do not remember to start at the university with a relationship . &quot;
intro@@ ver@@ ted get a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; I love you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used to interact with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted , and send him an SMS instead . &quot;
speaking of talking : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
&quot; as you start the university on the cli@@ max of the back @-@ man@@ ie , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have a little bit of fun . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made treats offer a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and will associate your face with a delicious surprise at the end .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; poorly mixed cl@@ ots made of flour , sugar and fat lead to people getting asleep when you arrive . &quot;
steal food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check this with the dairy owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a balanced deal as my ro@@ omm@@ ate , who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that you are in the true sense of the pro@@ verb to the people who sit in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbors , whether they make a little bit qui@@ eter to them , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and rec@@ alled her three @-@ hour examination . &quot;
would it not be romantic when your future sp@@ ouse would random@@ ly enter into the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it would not be ground@@ less embarrass@@ ing if you hold a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future marriage partner , join them and let them see each day and maybe take part in the way they meet all common friends ? &quot;

thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds in a project row houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass placing in containers or Turn@@ h@@ allen has no sustainability .
because people remain in a large part here .
&quot; given the refugee flow , we also need sufficient housing in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ story ter@@ raced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a semi @-@ detached house needs the least space .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different when people are sub@@ merged in residential blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each accomodation unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a living room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs . &quot;
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters per house is EUR 184 000 , without plot . &quot;
this is over@@ looked .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
guil@@ ds : building legally I have gone through my project correctly .

&quot; it is still under@@ mining , who creates three flats in a ter@@ raced house , needs at least three pit@@ ches . &quot;
only in the cities lack the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers don &apos;t have cars .
how did the residents react to their ter@@ raced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who have accused me to create luxury homes for asylum seek@@ ers .
© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc .
but don &apos;t you exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable apartments ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but built luxury apartments , which can hardly afford to be able to afford . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the only educ@@ ating mother or the t@@ anner . &quot;

at that point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
&quot; on the premises of the gas station , there were also three people . &quot;

&quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; &quot; - Slovenia refuses &quot;

&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia is rather the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;

&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was it to propose certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , the first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d in the morning , in the course of the day , further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants were the whole night of the approximately 500 kilometres away from the Maced@@ onian border by Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has been made , so the police said we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;

&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cros@@ sings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot;
&quot; if the remaining refugees are going to go on to the Croatian border , it is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm Wedn@@ es@@ days early on a local appearance in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debate about alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;

&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are recorded by Croatia . &quot;

&quot; on their most anticipated session in the years Federal Reserve , strateg@@ ists spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ og@@ any table in order to decide whether it is time for the first time for nearly a decade . &quot;
&quot; im@@ pending on them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ story sitting room is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all the other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ time order from Congress : maxim@@ izing US occupation and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ even third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ an@@ ed by the unprecedented stimulus from the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that they grow solid , recent turbul@@ ence in global financial markets might be fear@@ ful to rein@@ force these vol@@ atility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is just a quarter of a percentage point . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself to the financial market itself . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently interviewed by Bloom@@ berg , have predicted an increase in interest rate this week . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets expect a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance for an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a drop in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the pro@@ position , unless the strateg@@ ists hit the blow by promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;

&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , &quot; they would have to go very far in their explanation to calm down the financial markets so that they would not panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would so@@ ak the financial markets , because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; before a month , the F@@ ed appeared on a good way to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , improvement in the labour market was solid in this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; although inflation constantly ran under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of much lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world put together in the end of the last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial Average weigh@@ ed more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that a slow@@ down in Chinese economy would force global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat this month , while the Dow is now around 10 % below the peak of May . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; if the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks would not have occurred in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ Liner , Senior Research Fellow at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the U.S. Central Bank . &quot;
now he pre@@ suppos@@ es that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ lli . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in its decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .

&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management by En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of acquisitions on financial markets movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ er , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to increase interest rates , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its lead interest rate by 0.7 percentage points in three sessions , despite limited recogni@@ zable effects on the growth in the US , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; a year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should only put aspects of financial stability in the first place during a serious crisis like the market crash in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence is not close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of interest , because the markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe that it should be prec@@ eded by the time . &quot;

&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories for about 500 calories per day . &quot;

&quot; after Hungary , practically no transit goes , there is more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces that the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les can be reached .
&quot; however , the route is dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Interior Minister and if it is necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior Rank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .

&quot; after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reach only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; according to government information , the 20,000 migrants were still living in the country . &quot;

they were very thank@@ ful .
a man didn &apos;t let it take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train towards Pass@@ au , after the announcement that rail transport was set to Germany , but still beyond the limit . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was removed from the border to W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot;

&quot; instead of the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately , in the construction of structures to help humanity , our ch@@ anc@@ ellor has officially taken up the position of the Hungarian government in the dark circles of National Socialism . &quot;
Lei@@ d@@ bearing of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions now .
&quot; the refugees will also have to notice that the &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;

&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; all three women have left a ly@@ rical way why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , when the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; could their answers become the player &apos;s heart , who won the bach@@ el@@ or &apos;s heart . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except themselves - Mack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house , and ( Sar@@ ah@@ s ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought it was all over the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet on the ground , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; from her point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; der One &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now ready for him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was enig@@ matic . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;

&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ ls to a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of Kath@@ mand@@ u capital . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , senior district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , some of them threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ hak@@ al said , the police have used tear gas and then fired into the air before they attacked rubber feet . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber liners used to kill them , which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last week of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ lad@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would decrease their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of Th@@ arus who want to have their own state .

&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal that has been centrally ruled for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight diab@@ etics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
&quot; it is still too early to say , whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who are non @-@ surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a gui@@ del@@ ine to the new study in J@@ AMA surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity surgery has been proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes but most studies have been carried out in people who are sick and obes@@ e with a body @-@ mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have been collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity surgery - Mag@@ b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c formation - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained among those who were non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease was completely dissolved and at 28 % partially . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also monitored the blood sugar level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ emic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the guiding researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the host rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching bigger decl@@ ines in the BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 4 versus 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who under@@ went obesity surgery , about 29 per cent less likely to die during 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study has no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without an increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient is lying between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we are waiting for a long time until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have accumulated their body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;

it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dal@@ ai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe could not record all the refugees , said the Dal@@ ai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leader urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke to the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10 @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford which is devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be posed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is indeed admi@@ rable , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , it is wonderful , but in the meantime , you must think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim lands , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we have to think about how to reduce killing in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence never solved this problem , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke to the problem of violence and also commented George B@@ ush@@ s &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and revealed that the violent reaction of the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after 11 September I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of intake of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last four years
&quot; poison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swal@@ low strong alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of hand dis@@ infection equipment were reported in children under 12 years , the poison control centres reported , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to im@@ press their friends , or because of a mut@@ ation in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube demonstrate how adolescents drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
young people have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mouth water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ umed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing for children . &quot;
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially for small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Institute of Tox@@ ic@@ ology at the University of Kans@@ as , the transm@@ itter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let down whis@@ ky around , but people leave these hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in reach of children , and when children come from it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold used in an adult by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency physician , who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ung@@ ed her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and turned his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s mother , CNN . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
&quot; Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , and to store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside of the child &apos;s reach . &quot;
&quot; beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities suspect that the product meth@@ anol contained , a fatal solution , instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students planned for the fourth class in the state of New York to poison their &quot; gem@@ a &quot; teacher , sending anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly sensitive to hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant and ban@@ ished her from her room .
the police examined the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous plan as a &quot; hab@@ itation &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authority .

so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;

Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had trouble with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty will help . &quot;

&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ casts series that I &apos;ve made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of fact .
but I think there is a strong probability that it is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ tic of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the judges will have allowed the storm @-@ players &quot; ring events &quot; with his team during the high storm trophy in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Coach Wayne Benn@@ ett made a little comment to the Storm team after his team scored the final win against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; &quot; sample example &quot; &quot; of the rug@@ by league and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land are not too good &quot; &quot; in rings . &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the tor@@ ped@@ o of his team and said they were only focused on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading train@@ ers at his team is confident that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring events when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have nothing to change in our def@@ en@@ sive system or the techniques throughout the year . but over the last six weeks , we have made our contact with tac@@ kles to a real focus , and that has provided us the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train . so he is probably not acc@@ ustom@@ ed to losing it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 2 ) 1,@@ 506 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne said he will take care of a shit about it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play them . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was around the big games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is it an exciting game ? &quot;
do you want to report this message ?
&quot; for me , it is the game plans . &quot;
&quot; when they mention us , it means we will meet them in a phase . &quot;

&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed as he met his co @-@ accused at the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of the Dro@@ ge in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ caine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that it could have been in the café out of a harm@@ less reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security coll@@ ectively to reach his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the asser@@ ting statements of the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Judge Flan@@ agan . &quot;

&quot; H@@ og@@ g then said to the officials that he did it , because it would lead to &quot; &quot; p@@ ests in the internet &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the Berlin Constitutional Court also confirmed that a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009 agreed a decent accommodation in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; for more than three months , the former pla@@ inti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create this and we create it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this is almost twice as much as it is built before ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; dramatic is the lack of housing , but above all with affordable rental objects : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments come out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable homes will also apply to refugees . &quot;

&quot; the report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market . key Regions • Americas • AP@@ AC , EMEA , AP@@ AC and AP@@ AC &quot;
&quot; in addition , scientists and federal states agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; both assumptions seem unrealistic : for example , the impact of a global shock is likely to vary from one region to another . in this issue on regional labour markets , Norbert Schanne employs novel methods in spatial econometrics to describe and forecast their development . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not asked systematically after their qualifications to help them start their careers , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Mig@@ ration@@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , there has been a political change in Germany according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt : from the prohibition of refugees to the recognition of labour . &quot;
&quot; while there was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation , the asylum seek@@ ers to a residence . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; this paper investigates the impact of non @-@ take @-@ up for two hypothetical scenarios , namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by € 100 per month . IAB @-@ Discussion Paper 20 / 2015 &quot;
&quot; until now , there is still no adequate supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
&quot; in addition , studies show that jobs are often shared by personal contacts . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the establishment of networks is therefore based on Thr@@ än@@ hardt of the Königs@@ weg to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few @-@ fle@@ dged parents give their children to the kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; for the roots @-@ rooted parents , it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ ner , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ pieces in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators rise strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of education - for example by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students are prepared without German knowledge in welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a secondary language . &quot;
&quot; on them there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ ays from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal country does not prohi@@ bit asylum seek@@ ers or memory studies - the only exception was Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has given up his post@@ ure . &quot;

&quot; for refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ dung , no services are given after the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance law , if they begin studying . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the latter does not receive a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since it does not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ o@@ bear@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this Span@@ i@@ ard short@@ ens to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; however , this financing gap must also be closed , says Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play an important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually take the same rights to Islam , as they have churches , and to develop the existing state churches law to a new state religion relationship . &quot;
the establishment of an Islamic welfare association would also be important to take care of the newcom@@ ers .

&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bayer@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is forced . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since a scar@@ ce decade .

&quot; in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and be able to test their tests again . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; in particular , refugee children are particularly vulnerable to refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;

&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down by a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the Falls quickly spread over the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by statements by members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to join the speech of Mr Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had re@@ sted it and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the talk he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokesperson for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones , they warned against disturbing Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es speech . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said to journalists following Mu@@ gab@@ es &apos;s speech . &quot;

FC Arsen@@ al Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; he stressed opposite Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation progres@@ ses according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history its participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury threat@@ ens not the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his knu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical view , but as Wen@@ ger acknowledged , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return to the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has 23 different diseases from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that it has been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , most of the vulner@@ ability days . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a prone period of time to strengthen your body and win combat strength , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope that his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career from the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to take a little break , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with the judge &apos;s scale 3.2 . &quot;
this year was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; in the opinion that Arsen@@ al has pulled out the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains driven by the distant hope to lead the association with its first European cup victory . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it has never worked with Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;

&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open , now more dou@@ bt@@ less than ever before , as suicide rates among young men in a 15 @-@ year @-@ high show . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and three times more common in men than women . &quot;

friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 High @-@ School students with de@@ pressive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mental healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication guided through social media , with its focus on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have doubled the need to appear strong , vital and successful , even though the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently , money can &apos;t really buy luck . &quot;
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head .

Mary meets PS@@ G to help Mal@@ m@@ ö
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G , to Mal@@ m@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Mal@@ m@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park Stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria arrived less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French Master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before reaching their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ shot in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Masters since they are not only aiming for the qualification for the K.@@ O. rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he started his career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents and look back , even if there are certain things we need to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team who was able to hold a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on its own place against Bor@@ deaux , but he was exposed in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine wing stor@@ mer was referred to as the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he passed in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö defense before he finished in the long corner of the net . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , who hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , came to An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field , and with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field , a serious opponent . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed close to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s pole in the 3@@ 4. minute , they offered little support . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes jumped up , with some mis@@ ses and bad ends , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not less than five attempts at the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the re@@ start . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic who turned the Di Maria into a shot , which was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ... &quot;
&quot; the second goal fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth season , after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had caught up a left flank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Mal@@ m@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result was low before the waiting list Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norweg@@ ians said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which does not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not enough .
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film production
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said it is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; as a result of the Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , who emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives , emphas@@ ised on a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the cast of the film and not at the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian began to soli@@ di@@ fy . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .

Dam@@ ons comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the head of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Matter had a nation @-@ wide effect and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to command discrimin@@ atory practices against color . &quot;

&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , Chief of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Matter has published an explanation , as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot;

&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sports climbing and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which has just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could shut down all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Camer@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time , with which he was the first ath@@ lete , who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds quicker , making him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prize of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had to live , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer Kent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter , to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than a fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; We@@ ed said . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it receives the great gra@@ tification . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ates any gru@@ dge on that .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received the crowds of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior was extended for an A@@ wesome Weekend ; the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minnes@@ ota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; in the past , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against Minnes@@ ota Tw@@ ins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field . &quot;
the Tw@@ ins gave a chance to climb within a half of the Houston Astro@@ s for the second American League wild@@ card space .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit was three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth place . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 interior and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen of any game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ters Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first round since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has w@@ asted the hard@@ wood well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , clearly better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly to the game . &quot;
&quot; with three races in the back@@ hand at the end of the seventh inner@@ ings , Tw@@ ins had their best chance to get back to the game again . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second bass eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy passed down the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finale run , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
Resultate WT P@@ ari@@ chat - Resultate April 2016
&quot; after Detroit was added to an insurance @-@ run at the end of the ninth inning , Wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed sh@@ ov@@ el S@@ ano is out of three pitch for its fifth round . &quot;
Detroit benefited from the start of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three races in the first two Inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ ans , who had been painted before the game from the injury list after being stolen for more than one month . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after having received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes gave up a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the scoring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers lay in the second , a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; said Tw@@ ins manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; he was not particularly well beaten , but he caught the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch @-@ count , did not score points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three races with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .

&quot; for man@@ gos contain relatively high sugar , especially su@@ cro@@ se . &quot;

&quot; when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant . &quot;
&quot; the form@@ work colour alone tells nothing about how ripe fruit is ripe , so green man@@ gos can taste very delicious . &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and consume within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .

&quot; in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino on Wednesday , a well @-@ known place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was bapti@@ sed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; on the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .

Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held himself as a young August@@ inian m@@ ön@@ ch in 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .

hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works attributed to Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost updated the introduction and updated Bible texts .
&quot; at the beginning , was the word ? &quot;
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated his very personal interpretations of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas in 150 moti@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means in@@ significant with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the specific topics , this can be quite right . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has met a subjective artistic selection from the many subjects of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles , which are subject to topics such as cross @-@ road , pla@@ gues , command@@ ments or fa@@ ther@@ es . &quot;
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare Hogan Lov@@ ells
&quot; and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the basis of painting with the respective Bible passages . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible passages from Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus transl@@ ates into current connections . &quot;
these texts are as verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original scrip@@ tures of Martin Luther and each of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts in the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter Order . &quot;
&quot; since the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt recalls . &quot;
I tried to work that so I might also wear my father &apos;s father again .
&quot; his second aim is to help art in a fast @-@ growing period of time again : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is characterized by rec@@ l@@ ame today , and that &apos;s no@@ isy . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is being pushed out .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures have always a secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer go into the pictures , let them look , discover and feel what force they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his opposite . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ alto @-@ bi@@ ble in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his images . &quot;
&quot; old did not pay attention to the Bible completely , but chosen for him important , also mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not a co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text simply explains . &quot; &quot;

&quot; as a result , the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football team can help and wants to help .
&quot; the decisive turn@@ out , however , must put the politics . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the German Soccer League has extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years . &quot;
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun @-@ Stiftung , we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; ren@@ amed Nier@@ sbach at the edge of the UE@@ FA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;

&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professionals have a clear sign when they are on the left tri@@ cot jam instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logos ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &quot; &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; said Leverk@@ usen &apos;s Sports Director Rudi Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , nobody is allowed to take away . &quot;
&quot; we can use football @-@ federal lists , no , we need to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and capabilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;

&quot; in this and next year , the association will jointly host the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government more than 300,000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;

G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; highlights : display mannequins , which are terri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , including Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skirts . &quot;
I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of the Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; G@@ aul@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is fortunate that the designers have changed his attitude to a show about his person at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; in fact , he was on the contrary , because : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ eder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the barely survi@@ ving work of the man , who has written fashion history without ever having an apprentic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall art work for which much effort was carried out : to recre@@ ate the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list has been engaged . &quot;

&quot; he stands for the first , grac@@ eful fashion experiments of the designer . &quot;

&quot; in this way , our products hardly reach the customer . &quot;
&quot; today in the Asian region , the bulk goods are produced much cheaper today , and almost exclusively distributed over chains . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; so , there are enough reasons for new ways . &quot;

&quot; to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , one must find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that needs time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base . &quot;

XI urges to open the economy more broad@@ ly to the world
&quot; the economy has to open wide out@@ wards to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday , a group that was commissioned to reform the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should endeav@@ or to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business startups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promote new start @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population mil@@ king system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list will be created , the sectors and companies that are not in question for investments . &quot;
the system is tested gradually and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ sures the market a greater role in allocation of resources , guarant@@ e@@ eing a legal state of law and the market open , the statement said . &quot;
&quot; the government will also lo@@ osen restrictions on the powers of the company , and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded enterprises and bring better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;

EU wants to double mer@@ cury limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors , and the consumers thus expect a significantly higher dose of nerve damage . &quot;
Food@@ watch &apos;s Consumer Organization critic@@ ised the plans sharply : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies will be forwar@@ ded with full force of pregnant and inf@@ ants &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch .
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve head for large fish should be raised at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogra@@ m of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors have already been bur@@ dened so strongly with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 percent of the sizes cannot be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be ru@@ de . &quot;
&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU according to Food@@ watch wants to ti@@ ghten the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; however , food@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low , that they already hold the planned peak values today . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
mer@@ cury is one of the most toxic heavy metal that is heavily enriched by the food chain above all in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; according to the Federal Government , the Federal Government warns that &quot; already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains in terms of the maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is primarily due to coal burning in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information of the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock estimated more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had cited in March from paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings from mer@@ cury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health haz@@ ards in the EU warning system RAS@@ FF . &quot;
