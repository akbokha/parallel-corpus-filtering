&quot; III ) Should account of the repeated ref@@ us@@ al of the community , the designation of inspec@@ tors of the organisation will agree , the Council of the Organization - as the Director of the organization - in the following as &quot; Director General &quot; - thus deals with the aim of meeting appropriate action . &quot;
B ) The community and the affected States have the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organisation can actually be able to accept their duties under the con@@ current tasks .
C ) the visits and activities of the organisation of the organization are so furnished that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and disorder for the community and the States and for the inspection of underlying peaceful activities such as possible are ;
II ) Protection of industrial secrets and other the inspec@@ tors of the organization dedicated to the knowledge of confi@@ dential information .
&quot; each state turns against the organization , including their assets , funds and funds , as well as compared to their inspec@@ tors and other officials , the tasks of the agreement on the privileg@@ es and deliver@@ ances of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this agreement will be termin@@ ated in terms of nuclear materials , when the community and the organization has been dil@@ uted , that the material is consumed or di@@ lu@@ te in a way that it has become a nuclear work that is not use@@ able or virtually non @-@ refundable . &quot;
&quot; the Community noti@@ fies the organisation according to the measures imposed by core material from the states , which is subject to the securing measures in accordance with this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this agreement will be termin@@ ated in terms of nuclear materials , as soon as the receiving state , as stated in this agreement , has taken over responsibility . &quot;
&quot; the organization takes documents , from which any dis@@ closure and , where the re@@ application of the securing measures are emphas@@ ized to the ongoing core material . &quot;
&quot; a core material that is subject to the securing measures must be used according to this agreement , with non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the production of alloys or ceramics , such as the securing measures must be termin@@ ated after this agreement in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the ker@@ at@@ material during the duration of non @-@ application of securing measures are not used to produce nuclear weapons and other nuclear spr@@ inkl@@ es .
B ) The organization and the community will make a provision that in this agreement the backup measures will not be applied for so long as the core material is used for such action .
&quot; the regulation is set as far as possible , as long and under what circumstances do these securing measures cannot be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , securing measures will be applied again in this agreement , once the core material is re @-@ led again to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization becomes over the total amount and composition of this in the appropriate state or the appropriate material , and over any dis@@ closure of such material from that state or these states on the current state . &quot;
&quot; this explains their consent as quickly as possible ; it only covers issues such as temporary and proce@@ eding of reporting , but does not include approval or secret protection of military operations , and does not refer to the following use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the States bear the cost , each of them in carrying out their respective comm@@ itments from the Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community , states or persons who are subject to their territory , are subject to an extraordinary costs due to a special replacement of the organization , so the organisation ref@@ unded this costs as far as they have prepared in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization carries the costs of all additional measurements and sampling , which are demanded by inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states ensure that the liability insurance for nu@@ kle@@ ar damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be eligible for the organisation and their officials for the purposes of performing this agreement in the same manner as on the nationals of the States . &quot;
&quot; each claim that the community or a state opposite the organization or the organization across the community or a state of damage , with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident - to claim that from the implementation of the securing measures imposed upon this agreement , is consistent with an international law . &quot;
&quot; the Council , according to audit , report submitted by the General Director General information that the organization has not been able to in@@ corporate any nuclear weapons , such as nuclear weapons or other nuclear war@@ heads , he can also refund the reports that must be provided in Article X@@ II , paragraph C of the Statute and , and , if necessary , take the appropriate measures there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass was obtained by the applied safety measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contra@@ parties are concerned , each representing the advice to grant the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; in request of the organization , community or state , consultations will take place on issues related to design or application of this convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to seek , therefore , to seek that issues relating to design or application of this agreement will be reviewed by the Council . &quot;
&quot; the Council encour@@ ages the community and the affected state , to participate in the explanation of such issues by the Council . &quot;
&quot; with the exception of disp@@ utes to disp@@ utes between the Council of Article 19 or one of the Council of the council are disp@@ utes ar@@ ising from the design or application of this Convention , which is not on negoti@@ ating or by another by the organization , the community and the States , which consists of five arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states design@@ ate two arbit@@ rators , the organization also ren@@ ames two arbit@@ rators , and the four so called refer@@ ee will elect a fifth , who is chair@@ manship . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organization were named in thirty days after the application , the community or the organization can &apos;t seek the President of the International Court , this arbit@@ rators can design@@ ate this arbit@@ rators . &quot;
the same procedure is to apply if within three days after the nam@@ ing or appointment of the fourth arbit@@ rators of the fifth arbit@@ rators are not yet chosen .
&quot; a majority of members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court is profitable , and all decisions are required by at least three arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the arbit@@ ral tribunal shall be binding to the organization , the community and the concerned States . &quot;
&quot; a ) This agreement comes to non @-@ nuclear weapons , the Treaty Party of the Treaty and members of the Community ( in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that his procedures are concluded for the entry into force of the Convention . &quot;
II ) When the organization of the organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its securing measures in relation to this state for the purpose of this agreement .
a ) The organization , the community and the States cons@@ ul@@ ted one another on request of a contract parties about a change in the Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the States . &quot;
C ) The General Director teaches all member states of the organisation immediately from any change of the Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention occurs on the day in force , where the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification that their procedures are complete for entry into force . &quot;
B ) The Convention remains so long in force such as the states of the Treaty .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; stated in this agreement is the Convention and the Protocol .
&quot; the purpose of this part of the Convention is , to determine the implementation of the part I on securing measures such as required . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the securing measures determined in this Convention , is the tim@@ ely discovery of the dis@@ solution of significant quantity core material for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear war@@ n for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rence from such a turn through the risk of early discovery . &quot;
&quot; to en@@ rich@@ ment of the target set in Article 28 , the material accounting will be used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , associated with spatial procedure and observation as important supplem@@ entary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the examination by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material image zone , which is not shown for a period of time , is listed below the accuracy level specified for the stated process . &quot;
&quot; in implementing their investigations , the organization after article 3 full use of the safety system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear materials in accordance with this agreement is based on a breakdown in material image zones .
&quot; in use of its securing measures , the Community of de procedures and measures must make use of the following type and they , as far as required , predic@@ t how they are determined by the complem@@ entary lap@@ tops . &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system for determining amounts of preserved , con@@ stell@@ ated , lost , lost , lost or in other way from the continu@@ ance of the core material and the inventory of inventory ; &quot;
B ) evalu@@ ating the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measuring safety ;
C ) Proce@@ dures for determining and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recei@@ vers ;
e ) Proce@@ dures for evalu@@ ations not measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which has the core material area and the changes of this stocks , including the one - and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
&quot; g ) Pre@@ assignment , make sure that the accounting procedures and agreements are properly undertaken correctly ; &quot;
h ) procedures for the refund of reports to the organisation in line with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
&quot; in addition to this agreement , the securing measures are not covered by material in the mining , or of the Erz@@ re . &quot;
&quot; B ) becomes Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ous material which has not yet reached under letter c ) in the United States , the community of the organisation divi@@ des the amount and composition of the material , provided it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) is the core material which is suitable according to composition and purity for fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ open@@ an@@ um , the plant or the process phase where it is manufactured , or will this core material or another , in a later phase of the nuclear combustion nuclear material , it is subject to the other in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The safety measures stipul@@ ated in this agreement is termin@@ ated for nuclear materials under the requirements specified in Article 11 . in Article 11 , the community is not valid , however , the organization &apos;s recovery of nuclear material that is not possible or requested that the organization and the community cons@@ ul@@ ted each other via the application suitable for appropriate safety measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures stipul@@ ated in this agreement is termin@@ ated for nuclear materials under the requirements specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community will recognize that this core material is virtually non @-@ refundable . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the community , the organization liberated the following core material from the securing measures according to this agreement : &quot;
a ) special split material when used in grams - or smaller quantities as sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material when it is used on non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 if such a core material is re@@ cover@@ able .
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with a Is@@ ot@@ open@@ ation of Pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 which is over 80 % .
&quot; on request of the community , the organization cle@@ ave the core material that would be subject to securing measures according to this agreement , unless the entire , due to this article in the states , the core material volume is no longer than that . &quot;
&quot; a ) a total of a kilogram of special material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials : &quot;
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with a en@@ rich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and upward , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the en@@ rich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment that is below 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural uran , is calculated by the multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ shaped square of the en@@ rich@@ ment ; &quot;
&quot; B ) tot@@ aling ten metric tons of natural uran and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with a en@@ rich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ; &quot;
&quot; C ) twenty metric tons of metric tons , enriched ur@@ anium with a en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) , or below ; &quot;
&quot; the core material is intended to be processed , processed or stored for the securing measures according to this agreement , shall be delivered or stored for the re@@ application of securing measures to that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organisation of supplem@@ ental elimination , which is required in the scope of organising the successful and effective awakening of the organization after this Convention , in particular determine how to apply in the process specified in the Convention . &quot;
supplem@@ entary Sec@@ tions can be extended or modified without change of the agreement between the organization and community .
&quot; complem@@ entary lap@@ tops occur at the same time with or as soon as possible after the entry into force . the organization , the community and the States have all efforts to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of the agreement between the organization , the community and the States . &quot;
&quot; the organization , based on Article 62 of the initial report of the entire environmental impact of this agreement , represent the core material of this agreement in the states , regardless of its source , and continuing the results of their investigations into the following reports and the results of their investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States of Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the other hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; in ER@@ WA@@ EG@@ ENT NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER reasons - a ) The EEC decided to help the special shareholders in order to help the immediate demand of individual countries with low @-@ income , whose development is ob@@ struc@@ ted by universal resources of resources . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the EEC and Member States , that the entire member states will be dealt with within six months after entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization becomes their most likely to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the organization have cons@@ ul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the middle bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the organisation of the EEC has submitted a table , which is apparent in which way they intended to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization is aimed at account a special account under the name &quot; Special shareholder account &quot; which consists of the validity of the Member States ; this account is used as an administrator to the Special shareholders ; this account is specified by the organisation known as &quot; &quot; car@@ et@@ akers &quot; &quot; and , in this feature , the organization specified in this agreement and according to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the special accounts will be separate , separated from all other accounts and assets . &quot;
&quot; the contributions are as follows : a ) Payment is made in the form of cash or un@@ c@@ ins@@ ing school , which must pay in terms of the organisation of the organisation of the organisation in the organisation of the special shareholders , and to deposit the organisation in the organisation in the organisation . &quot;
&quot; B ) Payment is carried out in two rates , and the first in height of at least 45 v . h . within 30 days of entry into force this agreement or another between the EEC and the administrator agreed at the time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in height of the balance amount to 1 . January 1979 or at another point , which agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into consideration the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Every@@ one state can afford payments before the above dates .
&quot; the car@@ et@@ akers , according to the usual procedure of the organization , takes about propor@@ tion@@ ality pulling on the cash or the school@@ ing , to cover the issues of special issues and appropriate action onto the appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; during the guarantee of the loan , the administrator can lead to the conditions of the EEC by following factors : &quot;
III ) to the extent that the international economic factors has contributed to the current and fore@@ se@@ eable economic problems of the country ;
&quot; VI ) of the composition , and the trend of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan loss conditions ; and &quot;
&quot; VII ) the scope of the extent , where the problems of the coming countries apply through contributions from other sources . &quot;
&quot; each special rate indicates the financing of a clearly reverse development program or fore@@ igner ( including a sec@@ toral purpose of development ) , regardless of whether it is given to the procedure and practices that will be issued for the provision of the organization and practices , which is the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement to be considered in addition to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special accounts may not be used instead of regular funding of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or organization , which has been approved by the Bank or Organisation &apos;s involvement in the bank or the organisation on the day of the entry into force . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special requirements are subject to the same resi@@ due payment policy that applies to the organisation of development in general ; therefore , in ten years , they are refundable in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; speci@@ als are granted in one or more currencies in the Member States , and are refundable in this currencies . &quot;
&quot; amounts to the payment of this fan is directly to the organization , which ret@@ ains them . &quot;
&quot; each special transaction is represented by a separate loan agreement between the recipi@@ ents and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is stated . &quot;
&quot; the recei@@ pts from each speci@@ als may be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient , or for goods or services , which are established respectively . ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization , and those responsible for the time of the loan granted to the time of loan granted . &quot;
&quot; on this way , capital in@@ flow of special ac@@ companies will take place on the special shareholders , and the amount paid back to this way in the currency of a member state , as soon as possible from the administrator to the representative Member State . &quot;
&quot; the administrator teaches until complete regulations of all special requirements to the EEC via the Governing Board in preparation , and via Directors of the Directors approved projects and programmes . &quot;
&quot; during the period of dis@@ bur@@ sement of the special requirements , the administrator is taught the EEC to quarterly on the development of special requirements and the required expend@@ itu@@ res . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the EEC transfers the EEC as soon as possible after termination of the organization &apos;s financial account with a statement from external audit@@ or to this context . &quot;
&quot; after full dis@@ bur@@ sement of the warran@@ ts , the administrator of the EEC as soon as possible a detailed report on the project financed by the special shareholders and programmes are transmitted . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ akers is created and leads to suitable recordings and calculations , from which the contributions made to the Special shareholders , that are committed to the accounts and paid out of the account paid out of the account , and the withdrawal of the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers are closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement closely together .
&quot; to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator to the full issue of the means of the Special shareholders , the continuation of the Special shareholders , and the continued progress of the Special shareholders , and concerning all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , signed the EEC and the Organisation , if necessary , may not enter into force , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are due to immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with Article II Section 8 of the agreement , the total capital of all claims dealt rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of the Agreement shall rep@@ aid and re@@ im@@ ited to the Member States , so this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties have ended with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires the approval by the individual Member States and the EEC according to the legal provisions of each party .
&quot; the governments of the Member States noti@@ fies the conclusion of the European Communities , pursuant to the Council of the European Communities . &quot;
the Secret@@ ariat direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications together with a notification concerning the correct approval of this agreement by the EEC .
&quot; this agreement is effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the notification of the noti@@ fications under the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is made in two original languages in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , and every word no@@ isy is equally authentic . &quot;
&quot; considering that the agreement in the form of a letter to change the App@@ endi@@ x@@ s A of the Protocol , to join the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - H@@ AT issued the following VER@@ OR@@ DN@@ ESS : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation on the controlled Nuclear Weap@@ ons and Plas@@ m@@ aphy@@ si@@ cs
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE nuclear community , named &quot; Euratom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , below , &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; herein@@ after called &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the preparation of a large testing system , the project J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a common company according to Chapter V of the Euratom Treaty - will be referred to as a common company J@@ ET . &quot;
&quot; since several years , Switzerland has been dealing with research work in the area of controlled Nuclear fusion and Plas@@ m@@ aphy@@ si@@ cs and is well familiar with the relevant area . &quot;
&quot; since the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion were still extensive , it is in the interest of the contra@@ ctual parties of the present agreement to avoid unnecessary over@@ cuts and to accelerate their respective research crisis , which , due to the energy crisis , have attained a higher priority definition . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is alleged to shift any contract party in the position of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma assign@@ ments in the field of controlled nuclear fusion , and thus contributing to the common goal of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ competitive electricity production by using the controlled core fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the target of the present agreement , the contract parties refer to App@@ endi@@ x I and II of the defined research programmes , herein@@ after called &quot; Euratom &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure an effective cooperation , the Swiss program takes over long @-@ term targets , and the forms of co @-@ operation of the Euratom programme ; it is implemented by article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present @-@ mentioned organs , which may be relevant for the Euratom program . &quot;
&quot; every time the contract parties receive a new program , this is to the position of or of Annex I and II as shown in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot;
&quot; the association end in paragraph 1 is realised through : - the appropriate participation of each of the contract parties , during preparation and execution of the other party programs ; &quot;
&quot; - exchange of staff in the Euratom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries , which Euratom has signed a similar agreement as the present agreement , listed below &quot; associated third @-@ states , &quot; as well as the laboratory theories that are involved in the Euratom program ; &quot;
- Inclu@@ sive law on access to scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; in the framework of the present agreement , Switzerland is involved in the project J@@ ET . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the execution of the association provided in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this agreement , the association agreement concluded an association agreement , which is as far as possible to those who are connected between the Commission and the states and companies or persons , herein@@ after referred to the establishment of the Euratom programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Euratom will concern that Switzerland will be involved with the agreement of the agreement on the promotion of human exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , will be called &quot; agreements on personal exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the involvement in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the In@@ force of the Common company J@@ ET , whose statutes is accepted . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Euratom will concern that Switzerland may become the contra@@ ctual partner of any contract , the purpose of the agreement in the present agreement or other similar contracts , issued by Euratom during the validity period of the agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organs , which are entrusted with the execution of the association specified in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present agreement , are described in Article 5 @-@ 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement . &quot;
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , will discuss the steering committee of steering committee , responsible for the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
&quot; - the development of the research work , to monitor and manage to draw the best possible results in accordance with the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland will be represented by two delegates at the Euratom research program as part of the Euratom research program - in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has the information exchange and cooperation in all questions regarding the ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Euratom programme , is true that this task refers to all research and development skills to which this agreement rel@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and direc@@ ts its T * activity in the interest of the two parties in the Euratom program and in the Swiss program as well as in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments are taken into account in the world . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Pro@@ cedure , the VG will discuss one or more Swiss representatives at the Euratom program as part of the Euratom program , whenever the competent authorities are seeking . &quot;
&quot; the Advisory Committee , which gave the VG Research proposals for research suggestions with regard to the best possible scientific results , take this task concerning all research and development work true , on which is taken in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the Euratom research programme , Switzerland is represented by directors of the director of one of the participating laboratories . &quot;
&quot; the Governing Board of Directors , which has to monitor the implementation of the Euratom programme and responsible for this is that the capacities of the laboratories which are involved in the framework of the program carried out , will enable this task to deal with regard to all research and development , which are under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , he ensures the best possible use of the staff and for sharing the same between the laboratories which are involved in the implementation of the Euratom program and the Swiss programme . &quot;

C ) the non @-@ free evaluation of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions are non @-@ transfer@@ able diseases which can be ensured by simple medical examination and hospitals .
blood flow is as@@ ep@@ tical ; the blood becomes le@@ ver@@ ed by a closed loop system in a sterile bottle in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution was steri@@ li@@ zed before steri@@ li@@ zation .
&quot; after the termination of blood pressure , the bottle is immediately close and cool to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . thereafter , it must be opened immediately before using the blood . &quot;
&quot; quantity @-@ proof may not be more than 220 ml per liter of human being , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration may not exceed 97 g per liter . &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is previously determined by hand of blood cells and the ser@@ ge@@ um ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by investig@@ ating blood cells to a new sample of don@@ uts .

a concentration of human red blood cells is a unit of human whole blood that has been removed from the largest part of Plas@@ mas .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit that has been won ; other blood components can be present or can be partially removed .
the liquid content of the concentrate consists of either the remaining plasma or a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic bi@@ ode@@ tic solution which was added after the Plas@@ mas .
&quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , thus the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes volume is applied to the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for the manufacture must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the extraction must be carried out using a ster@@ il@@ ene , closed system , and only by pressure . &quot;
&quot; an artificial wat@@ ered solution has been added , so it is also available in its volume and composition . &quot;
the human drying plasma is obtained by de@@ hydr@@ ation of the liquid that reli@@ es on cent@@ ri@@ fug@@ ation or t@@ end@@ ment of human whole blood .
the human drying plasma is obtained by cold @-@ drying or any other method through which the proteins are avoided .
&quot; the dry product can be dissolved in a water @-@ quantity , which is equivalent to the liquid deficiency , from which one went out in the production of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentration of the so obtained solution must not be less than 45 g per litre , and the solution may not have a visible sign of ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;
donations in which ( using a fresh water sample ) is an endangered salary of I@@ so@@ h@@ äm@@ ol@@ ys@@ in or immune hem@@ at@@ glut@@ amine to exclu@@ de .
&quot; if the plasma is not mixed within 48 hours after bleeding , it must be steri@@ li@@ zed each unit in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to dis@@ able the harmful effects of bacterial growth in plasma , blood don@@ ating , the signs of a bacterial infections are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the risk of transmission of I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation@@ she@@ pat@@ itis , which may not contain more than 12 donations or other methods of use , the well @-@ known mass damage the risk in a similar way . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid sc@@ ur@@ ity from which , in the production of plasma , appropriate water quantity is to be added ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C . &quot;
&quot; a given quantity of plasma is dissolved in the water quantity , which has been produced , which is produced , the solution will under@@ go the following tests : &quot;
&quot; II ) one puts 1 ml solution a sufficient amount of thro@@ mb@@ in or calcium chloride , so it takes place ; the process can accelerate in the brood @-@ oven at 37 C . &quot;
the 24 @-@ level drying process in the presence of phosph@@ orous oxy@@ d under a pressure of 0,@@ 02 mm of mercury may not occur in the human drying weight loss via 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; human drying plasma is in a nitrogen atmosphere , or in an air @-@ empty space in ster@@ il@@ ene , closed bottle under exclusion of any micro @-@ organisms and possibility to store away from light and maintain on a temperature below 20 C . &quot;
human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions from human plasma proteins are made from the protein component that consist of about 60 % of the total protein mass of the human whole blood .
&quot; without regard to whether the final product must be flu@@ essi@@ g or dry , the preparation must be heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C in the final container , in order to in@@ activate the path@@ ogen of the I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation@@ she@@ pat@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in preparation of human alb@@ um@@ in , at least 95 % of the mass of the existing proteins must be alb@@ um@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in both products , no more than 10 mg of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin must be present per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the final product is frozen , it must contain at least 950 mg protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; the faction of human plasma protein is produced as a solution , thus it must be a total protein concentration between 45 and 50 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; if a solution is produced as a solution , there must be a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; compar@@ ing measurements of the viscosity and exercise , as well as cent@@ ri@@ fug@@ ing with Ul@@ tra@@ z@@ cent@@ fu@@ ge and electric power supply , which are made before and after heating to the solutions , no signs of den@@ atured the dissolved proteins are permitted . &quot;
&quot; after heating up to 57 C and six @-@ level sho@@ ot@@ ers in a mechanical ch@@ ills at this temperature , the solution must be completely free of visible particles . &quot;

&quot; it is also sol@@ dered parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ ative of the anti @-@ B blood group or a corresponding compar@@ ative of B @-@ blood cells . &quot;
the effectiveness of the server must not be less than 64 international units per ml .
non @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause a slightly noticeable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
&quot; anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum can be mixed on an object holder with equal amounts of 5 to 10 percent reduction of A1 and A2 blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination within the double time occur if the same attempts with the anti @-@ A blood group or with a standard prepar@@ ative same activity will be performed . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed to an object holder with a same amount of 5 to 10 percent swelling of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination within the double time occur if the same attempt on the anti @-@ B blood group or a standard prepar@@ ative of equal Avi@@ dity is performed . &quot;
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed in an object holder with the same amount of 5 to 10 percent swelling up of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ R@@ h blood @-@ group sera every specific@@ ity can be one of two types , which differ by the requirements of which a ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is achieved . &quot;
&quot; with others who are called &quot; in@@ completely &quot; , a ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved with presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as bar@@ gain in or with the help of other special methods . &quot;
&quot; some &quot; in@@ hib@@ ited &quot; Sera ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ers in object t@@ aries , also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are sp@@ ared in their own serum or plasma . &quot;
the following requirements for the efficacy of Sera to determine the R@@ h group may possibly change when international standard prepar@@ es are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people who are immune to the anti@@ gen D of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it acts with human red blood cells that contain the anti@@ gen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the anti@@ gen D . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Sera must have one tit@@ er of at least 1 : 32 versus C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking @-@ yield solution . &quot;

&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the anti@@ gen D , the serum should react to blood cells , the Do @-@ anti@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Sera , intended for use of lenses according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination with a same amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent re@@ spiration of C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds within 30 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people who are immune to the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of R@@ h @-@ Systems .
&quot; it re@@ acts with swelling of human red blood cells that contain the anti@@ gen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C @-@ anti@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; therefore , these Sera cont@@ em@@ plate for the C @-@ anti@@ gen , if the tested blood cells were sw@@ amped in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking salt solution . &quot;
the Tit@@ bits of the Anti @-@ C Sera ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; un@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ cd@@ de@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Sera , which are intended for use in lenses according to the test for Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) , they have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination with a same amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent of a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people who are immune to the anti@@ gen E of R@@ h @-@ Systems .
anti @-@ E Sera ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) should have one Tit@@ bits of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Sera , which are intended for use in lenses according to the test for Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contained in any form of anti @-@ D ) , they have to offer an invisible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
&quot; sera the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be extracted directly from the blood of immun@@ ised individuals , or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D anti @-@ D serum or anti @-@ E serum . &quot;
&quot; in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; a serum is intended for use based on lenses according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , so the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ che should show in all types of red blood cells that show a reaction , not less than with the ant@@ agon@@ ists of antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A Serum can be extracted from the blood of animals that may be immune to blood cells or specific substances in group A .
