&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for induc@@ ing ( 1 mg / ml ) and injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. Dec@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar disorder ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of severe to severe episodes , Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat severe episodes in patients who have addressed to the medicine in the past . &quot;
injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ less@@ ness or behavi@@ oral disorders when the oral in@@ gest@@ ion of medication is not possible .
&quot; in both cases , the solution can be applied to one or the melting tablets in patients , which have used the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; patients who are also taken to use other medicines at the same time , should be the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; the signal transmission between brain cells are imp@@ aired by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is probably mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ glomer@@ ate &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l looks like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but rather than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; da d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin at sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder are playing a role , bears Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to norm@@ alize the activity of brain , which prevents psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and will be prevented . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy that will halt the symptoms , was investigated in three trials up to a year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of injection solution has been compared to two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia , or similar illnesses , compared to a period of two hours with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in another study to prevent the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo which have been stabili@@ zed to 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder associated with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scope for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the processed tablets and the solution to income ( up ) . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received significantly stronger reduction in symptoms and patients who received placebo . &quot;
&quot; in use for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy dimin@@ ished in four of the five short @-@ term studies of certain symptoms more effective than placebo . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in addition to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the re@@ appear of certain episodes in previously treated patients and if it was given to an existing treatment . &quot;
&quot; in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses , Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions reduced significantly more effective than placebo as placebo and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ id@@ ical disorders ( un@@ controlled ) , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision ( increased s@@ ali@@ ation ) , stress @-@ hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased s@@ ali@@ ation ) , stress @-@ hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased s@@ ali@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , sleep disorders , insom@@ nia ( insom@@ nia ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ist Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and severe to severe episodes in bi@@ polar disorder , and with the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients , which were mainly man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ al pra@@ z@@ ole , facing the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the result that the advantages of the injection solution for rapid control of increased rest@@ less@@ ness and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients suffering from bi@@ polar disorder in bi@@ polar disorder , if a oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the management of Abi@@ li@@ fy throughout the European Union . &quot;
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is responsible for the treatment of moderate or heavy episodes of the bi@@ polar I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day ir@@ respective of meals .
an increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily ; independent of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been demonstrated .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered , if clinical factors should justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psychological illness and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases according to the beginning or by change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epidemic of epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increase in patients with bi@@ polar disorder with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , heart failure disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , cereb@@ ral diseases , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if patients appear at an AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ists should be drawn to decrease the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or has a clear fever without having an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti @-@ psych@@ otic medicines will have to be ab@@ orted by AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , or in conditions that are used with sei@@ zu@@ res in connection with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ osis which were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ al pra@@ z@@ ole , a increased risk of death in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study involving fi@@ xer dos@@ ing , a significant relationship between the dosage and response to un@@ wanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic active ingredients including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; there are no accurate risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related un@@ wanted events , with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic active ingredients treated with direct compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus , or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in relation to a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally used in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ia based on compos@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is required if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l can be taken in combination with alcohol or other central @-@ effective medicines such as seals ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , with this effect as clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study of healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to expect other high @-@ level inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore , similar dos@@ ing reductions . &quot;
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ izing may result in higher plasma concentration of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 to higher plasma concentration of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ( compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ) .
&quot; if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should survive potential risks for patients . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions . &quot;
&quot; after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dos@@ ing as before the start of the accompanying treatment . &quot;
&quot; dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be administered with a moderate increase of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations . &quot;
clinical studies showed doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l per day no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if pregnant or are pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to in@@ sufficient data security for security during the human being and due to the reproductive studies in the animal , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is just@@ ifies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; as with other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , to operate until they are safe that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on it . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the adverse events mentioned below is defined by the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; sch@@ izophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of smaller incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ yst@@ eria and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ists were compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % were placebo in placebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ al pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under Ol@@ om@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes at bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was diagnosed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % treated with placebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , yiel@@ ded no medical significant differences . &quot;
&quot; enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ ic subjects were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; to the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ists and sei@@ zu@@ res , undes@@ irable events and increased mortality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
clinical trials and since the market launch have been observed un@@ intenti@@ onal or intenti@@ onal survivors with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
&quot; although there are no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an overdose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits is , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma connection . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is communic@@ ated to the combination of a partial @-@ agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor , as well as an aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 ad@@ ren@@ ches and to the hist@@ amine recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; with the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , the Pos@@ it@@ ahs emissions @-@ tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ is@@ depen@@ dency reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ d@@ us and on the cleaning . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in one Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol &apos;s study , 52 of the share of the Respon@@ sibility of patients , involving a response to study medicine , was similar to study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary studies were defined , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ as@@ berg@@ - Depression @-@ Scale , demonstrated significantly stronger improvement than for Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % among the placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a me@@ tic@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included in the primary study &apos; weight gain ( N = 18 or 13 % of the value value ) in significantly fewer patients compared with an average weight of at least 5.6 kg ( i.e. an increase of minimum 5.6 kg ) . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dos@@ ing over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder showed a placebo superior to placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fi@@ xer &apos;s patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
&quot; in two Plac@@ ebo@@ arding and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with one man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed an effect on placebo over a week 3 and a lasting effect that was comparable to the rate of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie to such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly over 2 weeks did not reflect on lithium or val@@ ine @-@ mon@@ otherapy in reducing environmental symptoms compared to Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was superior to placebo during a stabil@@ isation period prior to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar rear , predominantly with the prevention of a bi@@ polar rear . &quot;
&quot; based on vitro studies , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ap@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , which is cataly@@ sed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al life period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in extensive met@@ abolic monitors over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and with approximately 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ izing via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , and in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , patients showed no sexually @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a pop @-@ specific evaluation for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal a reference to clin@@ ically significant differences concerning ethnic origin or the effect of the smoke to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and D@@ eh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose of test subjects with varying degrees of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics and D@@ eh@@ y@@ dro Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not enough to pull battles on their met@@ abolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated treatment , reproductive @-@ tox@@ icity , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , and for the c@@ ashed potential , there were no particular dangers for human beings . &quot;
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed in doses or ex@@ positions , which have exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have only limited or no significance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects of dos@@ ages of dos@@ ages ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) occurs in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equal to 3 to 10 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10 times the middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans .
&quot; in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a consequence of the balance of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ all of monkey after repeated oral treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose of people from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ) ( the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate were no more than 6 % of the concentrations observed in the study over 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and lie well below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; perfor@@ ated bli@@ ster packs for hand@@ ing individual doses made of aluminium in folding cart@@ ons with 14 x 1 , 28 x 1 , 49 x 1 , 56 x 1 , 98 x 1 tablets . &quot;
&quot; 15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is communic@@ ated to the combination of a partial @-@ agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; 22 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was superior to placebo during a stabil@@ isation period prior to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar rear , predominantly with the prevention of a bi@@ polar rear . &quot;
27 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : clinical trials which took a year or less continued during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is communic@@ ated to the combination of a partial @-@ agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; 34 in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were superior to placebo in a stabil@@ isation period prior to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar rear , predominantly with the prevention of a bi@@ polar rear . &quot;
&quot; 39 Pe@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is communic@@ ated to the combination of a partial @-@ agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
46 in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rear @-@ in case , predominantly with the prevention of a bi@@ polar rear . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day at any time ir@@ respective of meals .
patients who have difficulty using AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets can take the processed tablets alternatively to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders has been reported in some cases , after beginning or by change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that lasted a year or less , there was occasional reports on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle ten@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , speed@@ ometer , swe@@ ep@@ ts and heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally used in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ia based on compos@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :

&quot; 58 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly over 2 weeks did not reflect on lithium or val@@ ine @-@ mon@@ otherapy in reducing environmental symptoms compared to Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior to placebo in a stabil@@ isation period prior to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar rear , predominantly with the prevention of a bi@@ polar rear . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects for dos@@ ages have been made to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical trials . &quot;
patients who have difficulty using AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets can take the processed tablets alternatively to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .

man@@ ic episodes at bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients was under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is communic@@ ated to the combination of a partial @-@ agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in a me@@ tic@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included in the primary study &apos; weight gain ( N = 18 or 13 % of the value value ) in significantly fewer patients compared with an average weight of at least 5.6 kg ( i.e. an increase of minimum 5.6 kg ) . &quot;
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fi@@ xer &apos;s patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was compared to a solution containing 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablet form in healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; 99 Fur@@ thermore , a chol@@ it@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the balance of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ all of monkey after repeated oral treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose of people from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ) ( the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ ours in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be termin@@ ated and using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , a injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended in adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may vary depending on the individual clinical stage in consideration that already used for maintenance or de@@ bac@@ eous medicines ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , see the summary of the features of the medicine by AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y hot tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution . &quot;
there are no research on the efficacy of arith@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients suffering from ag@@ ility and behavi@@ oral disorders caused by sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; in addition to a drug therapy with ben@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ins in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed in respect to extreme seals or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on safety and effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not observed for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( due to prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , heart failure disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , cereb@@ ral diseases , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that lasted a year or less , there was occasional reports on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , speed@@ ometer , swe@@ ep@@ ts and heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus , or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in relation to a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally used in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ia based on compos@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ations was larger than compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study carried out in the healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dosage ) as a disposable in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ um ( 2 mg dosage ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ um . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , with this effect as clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot;
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism can result compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sible metabolism of the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 to higher plasma concentration of arith@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions . &quot;
&quot; after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dos@@ ing as before the start of the accompanying treatment . &quot;
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) received in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ um was the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ations greater compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the following side effects occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the adverse events mentioned below is defined by the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral oral care @-@ related side effects ( * ) , ( see Section 5.1 ) : &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % was placebo in placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was diagnosed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % were treated for placebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , yiel@@ ded no medical significant differences . &quot;
&quot; enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ ic subjects were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; to the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ists and sei@@ zu@@ res , undes@@ irable events and increased mortality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements in ag@@ ility / behavi@@ ours compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and behavi@@ oral problems , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms regarding the ag@@ it@@ edness and behavi@@ oral problems compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the observed average improvement of the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS @-@ Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ itation , a similar effectiveness in relation to the total population was observed , but a statistical significance was observed due to a reduced patient number . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
&quot; in one Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol &apos;s study , 52 of the share of the Respon@@ sibility of patients receiving a response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary studies were defined , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Depression @-@ Scale , demonstrated significantly stronger improvement than for Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia ( oral ) demonstrated a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was found at 34 % in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a da@@ zz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included in oral care rates ( N = 18 or 13 % of the value ) accounted for at least 7 % compared with the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; 111 in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partially ob@@ serves over 2 weeks in lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy in reducing environmental symptoms compared to Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study of man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to placebo in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rear , predominantly with the prevention of a bi@@ polar rear . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % bigger the AU@@ C after the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two formulation .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the median time to reach the maximum plasma time is 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys , and resulted in any direct tox@@ icity of a target group after repeated treatment in a systematic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular exposure . &quot;
&quot; in studies on the reproductive @-@ tox@@ icity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns after maternal exposure that was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) was over the maximum human exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) , tox@@ icity , Tox@@ icity , Tox@@ icity , Tox@@ icity , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , and for the c@@ ashed potential , there were no particular dangers for human beings . &quot;
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed in doses or ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans . thus , they have only limited or no significance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects of dos@@ ages of dos@@ ages ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ch@@ mal cell loss ) occurs in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equal to 3 to 10 mg / kg / day ) ( the 10 times the middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans .
&quot; in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a consequence of the balance of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ all of monkey after repeated oral treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose of people ) or 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the middle ste@@ ady state of AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study , participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing the effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients on the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines . &quot;
&quot; if one considers only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the efficacy and survival compared to the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicines . &quot;
it must also not be used in patients who have low neutr@@ ons in the blood before the beginning of the treatment .
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ist Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with whom the first treatment was no longer , effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines that it must not be given to other medicines , to decrease side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the general practition@@ er Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited a grant for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is not shown and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ in @-@ contained therapy is not shown ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neutr@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( Neut@@ ro@@ lic number &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series . &quot;
&quot; in sens@@ ory N@@ europ@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment is reduced , until a improvement is reached level 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of Dos@@ age adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with affected ren@@ al function and there are currently no sufficient data to dose Dos@@ age adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to un@@ adequate data for in@@ suffici@@ ency and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ at@@ kel@@ etal system of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that might have significantly more pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other forms of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be removed immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be led , and the patient must not again be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in the patient , there should be no further Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles to have increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ cy@@ tot@@ ic number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; whereas a Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been detected in connection to kar@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardiovascular diseases are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or per@@ taining heart disease or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diar@@ rhoea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ dic@@ s and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used with pregnant women or women in in@@ capable age , who do not practice an effective contra@@ c@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential . &quot;
women in a combined age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane to apply a reliable prevention method .
&quot; male patients , which are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , is advised during and up to six months after the treatment no child . &quot;
male patients should be advised before the treatment of a sperm con@@ dens@@ ation because of the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility exists .
Abra@@ x@@ ane may cause adverse reactions such as fatigue ( very frequently ) and dizziness ( frequently ) that can affect the transport of transport and ability to serve machines .
&quot; following are the most common and most important incid@@ ents of side effects , which occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated with 260 mg / m2 intraven@@ ously every three weeks . &quot;
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most striking vital tox@@ icity ( in 79 % of the patients reported ) and was rapidly reversible and dos@@ ing ; leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients suffering from Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 are the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lact@@ ose hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orus in blood , increased phosph@@ orus in blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease : &quot;
&quot; Dy@@ ast@@ ag@@ ie , paraly@@ sis , burning , dry mouth , mer@@ ging of g@@ ums , loose chair , o@@ at@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , pain in the mouth , oral pain , fra@@ ct@@ al blood disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the chest corne@@ al wall , weakness of muscle pain , muscle pain , abdominal pain , abdominal pain , muscle pain , dis@@ comfort in the structure , muscle weakness Very frequently : &quot;
&quot; rest@@ less@@ ness 1 The prevalence of sensitivity in relation is calculated based on a defined case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients &quot;
&quot; as these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency is possible , and there was no real connection with these events . &quot;
&quot; pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ k@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli @-@ active ingredient , which promotes the co@@ sting of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli from the tu@@ bul@@ lets and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing of their de@@ oly@@ li@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ into the trans@@ zy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components in the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies was proved that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el promotes the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ ous receptor and is based on a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation based in c@@ yst@@ eine in the range of tum@@ ors .
&quot; the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for m@@ ashed breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two inclu@@ de@@ dly un@@ blind studies and from 4@@ 54 patients , which were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III clinical study . &quot;
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second trial a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
&quot; this multic@@ entr@@ e study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received every 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of soluble pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; during the inclusion in the study , 64 % of patients had a affected state state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had temporary met@@ ast@@ es and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ amps . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only an adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for met@@ ast@@ ing and 19 % due to met@@ ast@@ as@@ ant and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression free survival and progression free survival and survival for patients who receive first @-@ line therapy are below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree of patients who experienced a peri@@ ph@@ ere of neu@@ rop@@ athy degrees 3 times during therapy .
&quot; the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy for bas@@ eline on bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown . &quot;
the pharmaceutical @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
active Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After intraven@@ ously gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took in multi@@ phase mode . &quot;
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume is based on an extensive extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ ation distribution and / or turn@@ outs of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el according to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 175 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane compared with a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 soluble pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; after a soluble pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el cle@@ aring , the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent free pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is met@@ al@@ igned to 6@@ α @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabolism ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ ax@@ el ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the amount of cum@@ ulative active ingredients amounted to 4 % of the total total dose with less than 1 % of the total total dose containing less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; however , over 75 years of age over 75 years , only few data are available , because only 3 patients in this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was observed at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light @-@ protected light protected by 8 hours .

&quot; • Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medication ( technical information ) , labelling and packing . • With unique image representation of the product can see cool@@ box for transport through the patients . &quot;
&quot; this means that it is similar to a biological product that is approved in the European Union ( EU ) , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and the same drug ( also called &quot; reference ist &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood cells that could occur in the connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications , in case the procedure is not possible before the procedure and can expect a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be led under the supervision of a physician , which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is in@@ jected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
injection can also be carried out by the patient or of the car@@ eg@@ i@@ ob@@ son if they have received appropriate guidance .
patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or patients who received chemotherapy should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ iles in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
iron values of all patients are before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
&quot; patients who received chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems can be caused by an an@@ emia through a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or thereby that the body is not sufficient on the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etin is also used to increase the number of red blood cells to reduce blood loss results .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration in a v@@ ein as part of a primary study of 4@@ 79 patients , caused by kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia . &quot;
all of the patients participating in this study was in@@ jected at least eight weeks in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene before being transferred either to se@@ amed or continue to be E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in between the beginning of the study and the study period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; the company additionally took the results of a study , in which the effects of under the skin was spec@@ kled , with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were changed to se@@ amed in the same degree as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared with this , patients who continue to have E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally result in symptoms of an en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , hur@@ ting mig@@ rant headache and confusion . &quot;
&quot; se@@ amed should not be applied in patients , which may be re@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ fa or any of the other elements . &quot;
&quot; se@@ amed than injec@@ ting under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ist Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for se@@ amed after the provisions of the European Union of evidence , the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company dedicated to the se@@ amed will provide information on medical specialists in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine . &quot;

&quot; treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,2 - 8,1 m@@ mol / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or in@@ adequate , with planned larger operating procedures that require a large blood volume rate ( 4 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign currencies , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied to an adult orthop@@ e@@ dic intervention in adults with no iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion products is expected . &quot;
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml are used to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood @-@ party program .
&quot; the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except at p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients where hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 @-@ 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; cardi@@ ac symptoms and fol@@ lic@@ ences can vary depending on age , gender and total disease @-@ load ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical development and disease resistance is required by the physician . &quot;
&quot; a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) , over a period of four weeks should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , patients can occasionally be observed in a patient individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s about or under hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bi@@ ologic vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) should be reached by 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or , if the permanent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
&quot; patients should be monitored regularly to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and stimul@@ ating symptoms . &quot;
&quot; the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher vibration doses than patients where initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher vibration doses than patients where initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; starting dose 50 , i.e. 50 / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary , with a dose of 25 i.e. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired destination is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; respon@@ sive symptoms and symptoms can vary depending on age , gender and total disease @-@ load ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical development and disease resistance is required by the physician . &quot;
&quot; in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bi@@ ologic vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) should be reached by 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be monitored eng@@ aging , to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine is in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of mit@@ igation symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in order by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ lt number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl over the initial value , the dose of 150 to / kg should be kept three times a week or 450 , i.e. 450 / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise is &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the re@@ type of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl in comparison to the initial value , the dosage should be increased to 300 , i.e. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after further 4 treatment weeks of 300 , / kg three times a week of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in order by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) , or the re@@ ku@@ zy@@ ten@@ se of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl , should be retained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the re@@ type of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl against the output value , a response to the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ fa therapy is unlikely , and the treatment should be broken . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , which is necessary to supply the pre @-@ care of ≥ 4 blood @-@ conservative , should be l@@ amed twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery . &quot;
&quot; with the iron sub@@ stitution , as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood @-@ party program , it should be started to make large iron reserves before the start of the se@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 i.e. / kg ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and the day of intervention ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively by 300 i.e. / kg every 10 consecutive days , on the day of the intervention and 4 days directly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis over the hose of a f@@ ist@@ le needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic cooking salt intake to water the hose and ensuring an adequate injection of the medicine . &quot;
patients who are suffering from the treatment with some ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin on a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ast@@ ocy@@ tes ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stro@@ kes within one month prior to treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ ne@@ stic th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ ils ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who can participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure , the application of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ fa in the following pre@@ - , esc@@ ale or atro@@ us disease contra@@ indicated : severe cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , v@@ ascular illness of cardi@@ ac disease or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with short @-@ written heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular occurr@@ ence . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare has been reported via the occurr@@ ence of an anti @-@ antibody PR@@ CA after a long @-@ year treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin .
&quot; patients with sudden work loss , defined as reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased demand for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ zy@@ ten@@ se should be determined and the usual causes of non @-@ oxid@@ ation ( polar , folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium or infections , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ l value is normal , taking into consideration the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ cy@@ te &quot; Index &quot; ) , which is determined ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20.000 / micro@@ liters or &lt; 0.5 % ) , and if no other cause of any loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin antibodies are determined and an investigation into the bone mar@@ row on the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be weighed . &quot;
data on immun@@ ogen@@ icity at sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of patients with a risk of anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 For patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 , the recommended maximum limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , an increased mortality risk and risk of severe cardi@@ ac cul@@ ular events were observed when Ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stim@@ ulated active ingredients ( ESA ) with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) were given . &quot;
&quot; controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ ins , if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentr@@ ating on the control of stimul@@ us symptoms and avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions required concentration . &quot;
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of high blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clinical evidence , cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or storage in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 , the recommended maximum limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; according to these findings , due to the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ fa in adults with kidney @-@ suffici@@ ency who are not di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of kidney @-@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated . &quot;
&quot; in tumour patients suffering from tumour @-@ effective treatment of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ fa , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ etin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ Gabe and the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin can be taken into account ( patients who may need to be trans@@ fun@@ ct ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b @-@ rise is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must minim@@ ize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ eutic an@@ emia - Dos@@ age adjustments with the aim to keep the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk differentiation among the respective patients that should take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; patients who are planned for a larger electrical orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure should , if possible , exam@@ ines the cause of an@@ a@@ emia before the beginning of the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ fa therapy . &quot;
&quot; patients who submit themselves to an increased orthop@@ e@@ dic procedure should have a reasonable thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , cannot be excluded that treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ fa for patients with a starting sh@@ ale setting of &gt; 13 g / dl can consist of increased risk of postoperative cy@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ ous events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , ep@@ ox@@ y has not been proven for ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine that they reduce the overall survival in tumour patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received chemotherapy was reduced , when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.7 m@@ mol / l ) was targeted &quot;
ep@@ ox@@ et@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be inspec@@ ted by C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dosage should be adjusted to increasing hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit .
&quot; in vitro investigations on tumor @-@ out studies , there are no evidence of an interaction between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; over thro@@ mb@@ otic , v@@ ascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ di@@ als , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ hib@@ itions , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin treatment , so also patients under ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine therapy . &quot;
the most common side effects during the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ depen@@ dency of blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia .
an increased incidence of diamond v@@ ascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
&quot; regardless of the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood don@@ ate and v@@ ascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetically engine@@ ered ep@@ ox@@ et@@ fa is gly@@ c@@ tured and in terms of amino acids and carbohydrates , identical with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin , which was isolated from the Ur@@ ine patient . &quot;
it was shown with the help of cultures of human bone distinctive cells that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ fa stimul@@ ates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and not affected the leu@@ cop@@ ic esis .
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ ost@@ asis ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ ome , 144 non @-@ Hodg@@ kin and 24 other hem@@ ost@@ ations ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 breast cancer , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 22 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma , 22 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ oma , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 others ) . &quot;

survival and tumor types were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin treated patients and the control patient . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin @-@ treated patients with an@@ emia showed a statistically significant , statistically significantly higher mortality rate than in controls . &quot;
&quot; overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin , treated patients and with controls . &quot;
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ical events in tumour @-@ patient , which can be treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin , and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are treated to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin in tumour @-@ patient who can be treated with chemotherapy , as a few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ric @-@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly prolonged half @-@ time period of about 5 hours in patients with kidney @-@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels that are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there are no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain equal , regardless of whether it will be determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone marker fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complications of chronic ren@@ al failure in humans and could be attributable to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study on hem@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated for three years with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , the incidence of bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis was treated to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 in animal studies with nearly the 20 fold of the application at the recommended daily week@@ day dose , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine led to dimin@@ ished body weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase of fat@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient may only store se@@ ven@@ ed separately for a period of maximum 3 days outside the fridge and not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with graduation rings and the filling volume is shown by a glu@@ ed label , so if necessary , the measurement of partial quantities is possible . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones ble@@ ak ) both in women after men@@ opause and men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high risk of fra@@ cture risk ( bone di@@ ps ) , including patients who recently suffered a s@@ trau@@ matic hil@@ ar@@ age like falling ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changed the normal process of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 m@@ g. of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tom@@ y should be obtained via the first in@@ fusion of a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or injection in one muscle . &quot;
&quot; administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and heada@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must only be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was recruited for the evaluation of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ ids and hips was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second trial included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently suffered a hip tin@@ cture ; the number of frac@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared to six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( a different Bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator for effectiveness was whether the salary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme , the bone substance is devi@@ ated ) in the blood , decreased by at least 75 % against the bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of vert@@ eb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures were reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tom@@ y 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are frequent in@@ fu@@ sions within the first three days .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied in patients , which possibly are exagger@@ ated ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ onate patients are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions in the in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ ek@@ bones ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) in a pine . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for physicians to prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients where the effects of the medicine is explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor . &quot;

&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tion@@ ation . &quot;
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tion@@ ation the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip frac@@ tom@@ y ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; for treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors , experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was observed a long reduction period in patients that have addressed to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is highly advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate supply of calcium , according to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent case of low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tion@@ ation , a initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended in front of the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
&quot; patients with kidney dys@@ functional disorder ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experiences for these patients . &quot;
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) An dose adap@@ tion is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended to use in children and adolescents under 18 years , as data are missing for in@@ convenience and efficacy . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney @-@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because of this patient population only limited clinical experience .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ ene is before the start of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a by adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the fast sett@@ ling of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure a temporary and symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ oc@@ ene can usually occur within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is highly advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate supply of calcium , according to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; canc@@ ers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be considered before a application of bis@@ phosph@@ onate a tooth@@ ing with reasonable preventive treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental procedures , there are no data available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ onate is reduced the risk of oste@@ o@@ eth@@ ro@@ ses in a j@@ aw area . &quot;
&quot; the clinical evaluation by the treated physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient , and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment . &quot;
the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of adverse events reported by pre @-@ hoping for patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ ren@@ to Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was comparable to the incidence of pre @-@ hop@@ pers between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , un@@ wanted drug effects are listed in table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney @-@ function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was used with kidney dys@@ functions , which was referred to as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum samples ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure . &quot;
the change of the cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured before administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney function and a restricted kidney function were in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis more than three years comparable to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ ic calcium values ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) were observed below the normal fluctu@@ ations in a large clinical trial , compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical frac@@ tures after a hip fra@@ cture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hips , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial was reported via local reactions to the in@@ fusion , as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the or@@ tho@@ ress region , especially with cancer patients , about oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the Kiev area ) reports the bis@@ phosph@@ onate , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
many of these patients had signs for local infection including oste@@ omyel@@ itis and the majority of reports rel@@ ates to cancer patients according to Z@@ ah@@ nex@@ ra@@ ctions or other dental offices .

&quot; in the case of an over@@ dose that leads to a clinical @-@ relevant hypo@@ kal@@ ene , can be achieved a compensation by oral calcium and / or a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium @-@ glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score for the case of post@@ oper@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of existing vert@@ eb@@ rates .
effects on morph@@ ine vert@@ eb@@ rates A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as already after one year the frequency of one or more new vert@@ eb@@ rates ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients of 75 years and over had a 60 % dimin@@ ished risk for vert@@ eb@@ rates compared to placebo ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed a permanent effect on three years that resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures found in an increase of 41 % ( 95 % CI ; 17 % to 58 % ) .
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the density of bone density on the lum@@ bar spine , hips , and at the dist@@ al radius compared to placebo @-@ treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Incre@@ ase the density of bone density of the lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.7 % , the entire hips at 6.0 % , the back @-@ h@@ um by 3.2 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients , treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ vic bone . &quot;
a micro @-@ computer@@ ized ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo an increase of tra@@ jec@@ tory bone volume and obtain the contra@@ ctual bone architecture .
bone tumor markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) in serum and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in the serum and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients during regular intervals .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP increased significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was reduced significantly by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not measured rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 by 12@@ 5,000 ) oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
the overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
&quot; in the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study , the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment increased by the BM@@ D in the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT treatment in the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study compared to the placebo @-@ treatment . &quot;
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led more than 24 months compared to placebo @-@ treatment for an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % of the total revenues and 4.3 % on the market share .
&quot; clinical efficacy in males in the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized , 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical structures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures were 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men in comparison to 8.7 % compared to placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the once annual administration of aging from Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was involved in comparison to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ e after 24 months compared to the initial value .
&quot; clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone of the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ological confirmed , particularly light @-@ severe Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase , according to the 2,@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ ple out of the upper middle standard for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
&quot; 11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , compared to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months , has been demonstrated in two six months compar@@ ative studies . &quot;
&quot; in combination with the combined results , a similar decrease in pain strength and pain relief was observed compared to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as Respon@@ si@@ fication at the end of the six @-@ month trial study ( on the therapy ) could be recorded in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; of the 143 by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with risk @-@ treated patients , which participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach was treated with 141 of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared with 71 of the patients receiving risk @-@ up to 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minute in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid per 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma concentration continued quickly on &lt; 10 % of the high value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
rapid bi@@ phase dis@@ appearing from the large circulation system t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a season of season Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al life : ½ g 146 hours .
&quot; the early distribution h@@ ates ( α and β , with the above 1 ½ -@@ values ) represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the prescribed dose is bound in urine , while the rest mainly is bound to bone fabric . &quot;
&quot; the total body cle@@ ance is ir@@ respective of the 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eous concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration of time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abolic in humans and because they do not have a weak or / or ir@@ reversible , non @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , and amounted to 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function is required until a cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min requires no dose @-@ adjustment of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
there are only limited data because of heavy kidney problems ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ert Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) are not possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight . &quot;
&quot; in case studies of dogs , single doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application has been administered in a dose of 0.6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , in total 6 times ( an accum@@ ulative dose , which corresponds to 7@@ times of human therapeutic exposure , which corresponds to 7@@ times of human therapeutic exposure , which corresponds to AU@@ C , corresponds to AU@@ C , corresponds to AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application for cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic effects in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection station . &quot;
&quot; the most common practice in studies with repeated application was a prolifer@@ ative primary sponsor@@ ship in the met@@ aphy@@ si@@ m of long bones in the growing phase with virtually all doses , a result which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ corro@@ sive effect of substance . &quot;
in rats one ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity of doses of 0.2 mg / kg observed as an outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ normal@@ ities and such a skel@@ eton .
&quot; rab@@ ato@@ genous effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the maternal tox@@ icity was pronounced in 0.1 mg / kg as a result of serious serum @-@ calcium mirror . &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic is a representative of substance @-@ class that is called bis@@ phosph@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , mainly est@@ rogen made from and@@ ro@@ gens , plays a role in rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is un@@ ordered , making the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a seems to norm@@ alize the bone structure , a normal bone formation ensures and thus gives strength to the bones . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or have a dental surgery , please inform your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; for use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nur@@ ses when you have taken other medicines / apply / applied and applied correctly , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicine from which it is known that they damage the kidneys . &quot;

A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is also used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients suffering from obesity ( body mass index index - BMI ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or over the overweight ( BMI of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond .
&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out on more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was used in comparison to a placebo as a support for the smoking . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to studies on the space setting , no single results showed that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was heavily assessed on this field of application . &quot;
&quot; what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA ? it is the most common A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA effects associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA , observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tra@@ ce@@ . ng The complete listing of related cases related to A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA reported side effects is the package number . &quot;
&quot; it must also be applied in patients who suffer from an existing depression , or suffering from anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it can cause the risk of depression and thanks to a small minority of patients Su@@ icide H@@ iz@@ dge@@ . &quot;

the Committee for Human Immun@@ o@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA with regard to weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight pieces
&quot; medicines in patients are used for patients who require health and non @-@ cosmetic reasons ( provision for patients and doctors ) , and to the Ar@@ z . &quot;
&quot; in addition to diet and exercise for treating a obesity ( BMI of 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ an@@ emia ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to the absence of data to efficacy and un@@ question@@ able .
&quot; La Depres@@ sive Diseases or mood changes with de@@ pressed symptoms were reported by up to 10 % , su@@ icides reported by up to 1 % of the patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; GE and de@@ pressed interference may not be applied , unless the benefit of treatment in individual case weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who have - in addition to obesity - no apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions occur . &quot;
&quot; relatives or other close persons are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the new symptoms of such symptoms , and get medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur . l@@ n &quot;
• El@@ derly patients The efficacy and in@@ suffici@@ ency of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not sufficiently demonstrated .

SS@@ E was examined in important patients as well as patients with obesity and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in other indications .
&quot; the following table ( Table 1 ) is shown below the treatment of adverse effects in placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients , which were treated for weight reduction and for related metabolism disorders . &quot;
&quot; if the incidence was statistically significant higher than the corresponding placebo rate ( for un@@ wanted effects ≥ 1 % ) or when they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for un@@ wanted effects &lt; 1 % ) . ng In the evaluation of side effects , the following cottages are basically laid : &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; common ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0,1 % ) ; &quot;
&quot; in a dre@@ aming study , in which a limited number of persons was administered by up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed . &quot;
the patients had a BMI of 30 kg / m ² or BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² and simultaneously existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia and / or Dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ an@@ emia .
&quot; n weight reduction after one year was for A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the output value , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( differential -@@ 4,9 kg C@@ I@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;

&quot; after 2 years the difference in total weight reduction between A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA and placebo was 4.2 kg ( C@@ I@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3.4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 weight reduction and further risk factors in studies in patients without diabetes , in which a mixed population of patients with &quot;
&quot; under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average decrease in the tri@@ glyceri@@ de of 6.9 % has been seen ( initial value tri@@ glyceri@@ de 1.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) in comparison to an increase of 5.8 % . &quot;
in a second trial in patients suffering from obesity and with previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( ser@@ en@@ ade ) was the absolute change of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value ( with an output value of 7.9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under placebo .
the percentage of patients who reached a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant Group and 35 % in the placebo group .
the difference in the middle weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.8 kg ( C@@ I@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 ; -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . LN
&quot; improving the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value in patients who had taken the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , were caused by direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and approximately 50 % by the weight reduction was explained . n eim Ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; after 13 days , the Ste@@ ady state plasma samples were reached after 13 days ( C@@ max = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 ng / ml ; C@@ t@@ C = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14.@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 268 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; the influence of the food : he subjects , who received the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in ne@@ eding state or after a fat @-@ rich meal , in the case of food intake a increased by 67 % increased C@@ max or by 48 % . &quot;
patients with black skin colour can produce up to 31 % lower C@@ max and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n most popular mac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic analyses ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75@@ - year @-@ old patient has an increase of 21 % higher C@@ max and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old patient .
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data regarding the safety of un@@ wanted effects , which were not observed in clinical trials , however , were detected in animals according to exposure in human therapeutic areas , as possibly relevant for the clinical use : &quot;
&quot; in some cases , however , not in all cases , the beginning of the con@@ vul@@ sions with proce@@ dur@@ al stress as dealing with animals seems to be connected . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given a long period prior to the p@@ airing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initi@@ als of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no undes@@ ired effects on the fertili@@ zation or cycle problems were observed . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on the pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study on rats to preventive and post@@ nat@@ al development a exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in u@@ ter@@ o and using Lak@@ e.@@ Dis@@ ser@@ tation no changes at learning behavior or memory .

Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug must be applied ) .
&quot; in addition , it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that can not be satisfactory in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sulph@@ ite resin or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis or insulin can be kept in the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis and insulin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better toler@@ ated and the blood sugar level decreases , making type 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; for more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was examined in tri@@ ple@@ t therapy , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ ite resin , in addition to 3.5 years they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ cer@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is stopped . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the glucose levels were lowered with doses of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the trial therapy , the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ ite resin in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values increased by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional treatment of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin were examined in 289 patients , patients who received Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin received a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who also took placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events in connection with Ac@@ tos were vision problems , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( decreased sensitivity to irrit@@ ating ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos must not be applied to patients who may not react sensiti@@ vely to patients ( allergic ) to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency ( high level mirror - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos in the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with which met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted auth@@ orization to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the management of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , curved and bear on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficient in@@ adequate and in which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data are available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are endangered at least a risk factor ( e.g. early heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest dose and increase dosage ste@@ pl@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or eyel@@ ids , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserves . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and eyel@@ ids when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing ma@@ v@@ ascular disease was performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency revealed that which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver characteristics are as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point out of a he@@ pati@@ al dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vomiting , cereb@@ ral pal@@ ms , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark Har@@ n , are the liver characteristics . &quot;
&quot; the decision , whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be continued , should be diver@@ ted by the analysis of the laboratory parameters in clinical assessment . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can be combined by li@@ pos@@ ing and in some cases with a fluid screen . &quot;
as a result of a hem@@ atology ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative studies using Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who received the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral two @-@ way or triple @-@ combination therapy with the insulin treatment , the risk of dos@@ ing @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , it was reported in the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ din@@ ance , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular de@@ ms with a decrease of visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct link between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular de@@ ma , but the doctors should be aware of a mac@@ ular de@@ ma if patients should consider disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological declaration should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summar@@ izing analysis of messages un@@ wanted events relating to bon@@ fires made of randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on &quot;
the calculated Fra@@ ktur incidence was 1.9 questionna@@ ires per 100 patient years when treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
&quot; in the PRO@@ TS study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient ) in patients that were treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of being pregnant , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or enter the treatment , the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the effects of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ actions with medicines prescribed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction inhibit@@ or are not expected . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with the fibro@@ c@@ lical ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , around the 3 @-@ fold . &quot;
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that when treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is dimin@@ ished in the pregnancy , hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the parent , and thus reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fat growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change of the turbine and the index of the lens as it is also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic acid .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ beat compet@@ ed over three times the upper limit of the norm range as frequently as under Placebo , but more rarely than in compar@@ ative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sulph@@ ites . &quot;
in an out@@ come study of patients with pre @-@ existing ma@@ v@@ ascular disease was the frequency of a severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w .
&quot; since the market launch has rarely been reported on cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , but when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in summary , a summar@@ ised analysis of messages of un@@ wanted events were randomised , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative medications . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of continuous pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures appeared in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in people who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; in taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day had no symptoms over seven days . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears on a activ@@ ating specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ine cells . &quot;
&quot; it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripher@@ al glucose in the case of insulin resistance . &quot;
a clinical study of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy was conducted over two years to investigate the time by the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the onset of therapy , a blood sugar inspection ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be calculated by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were random@@ ized with insulin in@@ adequate , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value fell by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continue to have insulin , reducing the insulin delivery in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over one year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ quota in comparison to the initial values . &quot;
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small group inspec@@ ted by type 2 diabe@@ tic tests .
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ glyceri@@ de and free fatty acids and an increase of HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel and a lower level , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one fell compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ glyceri@@ de and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; compared to the Plaz@@ ebo , there was no statistically significant increase in L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel , while under met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de reduced values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced tri@@ glyceri@@ de levels , but also improved the postoperative tri@@ glyceri@@ de levels , which also improved via a effect on the tri@@ glyceri@@ de absorption as well as the static tri@@ glyceri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ TS study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , and pre @-@ existing ma@@ v@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized to receive an existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular disease , received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is absorbed quickly , with the top concentration of the un@@ changeable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to efficacy in approximately the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or reduces the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; according to oral use of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , markers was found mainly in the subjects ( 55 % ) and a lower dimension in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the medium plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al life of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours and those of the active metabolism is at 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced stress function lower than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the parent &apos;s substance is similar . &quot;
&quot; in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , in mice , rats , dogs and apes matches the plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ atology , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible cardi@@ ac disease hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due primarily due to the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the parent , and thus reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fat growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induc@@ ted in the rat levels of hypertension ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the urine epithel@@ ium epithel@@ ium .
&quot; in a animal model of the family @-@ oriented poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ th@@ ene resulted in an increased frequency of piston . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , flat and wear on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
the calculated Fra@@ ktur incidence was 1.9 questionna@@ ires per 100 patient years when treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
&quot; in the PRO@@ TS study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient ) in patients that were treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
in another study more than two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were studied .
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ quota , compared with the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced tri@@ glyceri@@ de levels , but also improved the postoperative tri@@ glyceri@@ de levels , which has a effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as on the he@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was missing in terms of their primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ deadly m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , stroke prot@@ on@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , laying the results close that are not associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on no cardiovascular risk . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , flat and wear the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summar@@ izing analysis of messages un@@ wanted events relating to bon@@ fires made of randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies have been treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and received more than 8,@@ 400 patients that were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and demonstrated a increased incidence of broken bones in women . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ TS study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient ) in patients that were treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced tri@@ glyceri@@ de levels , but also improved the postoperative tri@@ glyceri@@ de levels , which has a effect on the tri@@ glyceri@@ de absorption as well as the static tri@@ glyceri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was involved in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as gland can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
in the study it was measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cer@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) that shows how well the blood sugar is stopped .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane introduced a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ mir@@ s that suggests that the blood sugar levels were greatly reduced as with other human@@ kind .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who possibly react sensiti@@ vely to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the dos@@ ages of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may need to be adapted if it is administered together with a range of other medicines ( the complete list is to take away on blood sugar ) . &quot;
&quot; at the end , the Committee for Human@@ ist Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane can over@@ flow the risks of diabetes in the treatment of diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a approval for the distribution of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily , if a rapid initi@@ ation effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
injection na@@ ves must be kept under the skin at least 6 seconds in order to ensure that the entire dose was in@@ jected .
&quot; patients , whose blood glucose levels has significantly improved by an intensive insulin @-@ therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; every change in strength , mark ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( quickly acting , bi@@ phase , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin or insulin analogue ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause that a change of dosage is required . &quot;
&quot; if the transition to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is required to take a dose of dose , this can be necessary during the first dose or months after switching to the transition . &quot;
&quot; some patients , with which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions came after a change of animal on human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia reported less distinct , or unlike the previous insulin . &quot;

Aden@@ ur@@ ic will be used in patients who have already been signs of cryst@@ alline oxid@@ ation including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or gyp@@ sum touches ( stones ) that can lead to joint and bone damage .
&quot; if the ur@@ inary @-@ acid level is still in two to four weeks , more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ on@@ ite , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , tox@@ icity may still occur ; therefore recommended that patients at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic are still taking additional medicines to prevent tox@@ icity . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an transpl@@ ant transpl@@ ant since it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , which participated in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( pseu@@ do@@ emia ) and from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different medicine for treating hypertension ) . &quot;
in the second trial two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
&quot; main indicator for effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary @-@ acid level in the blood was below 6 mg / d@@ dl . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , the aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) patients who once daily increased 120 mg in the last three measurements in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarrhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , skin rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular , patients with heart failure in pre@@ history may also include an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ist Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary balance in the blood as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic Hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia affects diseases which have already led to pri@@ st@@ abl@@ ings ( including one from the patient &apos;s history ) , or currently present the present process of tox@@ icity and / or of arthritis . &quot;
&quot; if the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ine levels still amounts to 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / d@@ L ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose of dose of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney dys@@ functional , efficacy and safety were not fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ert Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents , since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
organ@@ transpl@@ ant receptor when there is no experiences with organ transpl@@ ants . the application of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular diseases provides patients with normal heart disease or de@@ centr@@ alized heart failure . the treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other hard @-@ acid medicine , it can occur during the treatment start to an acute tox@@ icity , because using the decrease of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ al reflection first can be mobil@@ ised in the tissues in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; B. at mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so far reaching that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; liver disease During clinical studies of phase 3 , slight refres@@ ments of the liver functional values were observed in the patients treated with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 3,5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to carry a liver function before the beginning of the February and the course of clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ ia was not performed in Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to a rise of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a inhibit@@ ing of metabol@@ ari@@ zation of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with a rise of Feb@@ u@@ static exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , the application of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors were not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events . &quot;

&quot; in a study conducted by subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily use a mean 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak export effect of the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
ant@@ acids : it could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid which contains magnesium hydro@@ xide and aluminium hydro@@ xide ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease of C@@ max by 32 % but no significant change in AU@@ C causes .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies do not aband@@ on side effects of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect imp@@ lications for pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when purchasing a vehicle , control of machines or the practice of dangerous activities , until they can be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC will not affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of investig@@ ating cardiovascular problems has been observed in the total f@@ eb@@ is@@ in@@ ol group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ ol group study in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ ol Group ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statistically significant differences were found and no real correlation was detected with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at . &quot;
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ i@@ os@@ cler@@ otic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the patient &apos;s history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( supplem@@ entary evaluation ) could be found in the context of treatment groups with up to 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all of the February @-@ part treatment groups .
&quot; diar@@ rhoea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies were not observed severe skin constra@@ ints , or severe floo@@ ding actions . &quot;
&quot; 7 off long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies were treated for patients up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the events reported on long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in the phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all of the February - treatment groups in total more than once , with patients who received February 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with a positioning of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in the p@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ studies of phase 3 for these doses either not reported or with a lower frequency :

action mechanism ur@@ ic acid is the end product of Pur@@ in@@ met@@ ism and evol@@ ves within the scope of re@@ ac@@ tion@@ cas@@ ade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ inary acid .
&quot; Feb@@ ost@@ at is a real , not pur@@ in @-@ sel@@ ective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ X@@ O ) with Ki @-@ value for in vitro inhibit@@ ors , which is below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area . &quot;
&quot; clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was performed in two P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study , as described below ) , which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
&quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in any study of the patients , with which the last three months of certain serum levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) were included in each study . &quot;
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment to study beginning of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( n = 10 ) . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority under 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with common used cans of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 times daily compared to the treatment using traditional Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

&quot; the decrease of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ine @-@ mirror on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed in the medical visit in Week 2 , while maintaining the entire treatment . &quot;
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum samples &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney dys@@ functional neg@@ ations The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney dys@@ functional restriction ( d. h ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was observed in 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in respect of the percentage of serum concentration in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ities ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; in two years , data from the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the long @-@ term reduction of serum levels showed up to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , resulting in a decrease of an incidence of tox@@ icity in the months of 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a tox@@ in unit ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in check@@ ers @-@ size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearing of gre@@ y@@ no@@ des up to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ s / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also received patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long@@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration period ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at after administration is easier and multi@@ pl@@ eted doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; for doses ranging between 120 mg and 300 mg , a increase of AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ ing propor@@ tion@@ ist increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking easier or multiple dos@@ ing doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is approximately 2,8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5,0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of serum concentration was observed when this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
&quot; distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l , depending on doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg . &quot;
&quot; the plasma connection of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary feed on Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is over the concentration , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are produced mainly by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ u@@ pro@@ static cur@@ cur@@ on@@ ide are mainly developed by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ edly Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine is un@@ changeable Feb@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ jug@@ ate ( 13 % ) , as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the urine over the urine , some 45 % of the dose as un@@ changeable Feb@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ jug@@ ate ( 25 % ) , as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patients &quot; kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , severe or severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
&quot; the average total @-@ over @-@ AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at decreased by about 1.8 times more than 7.5 million g , h / ml in the group with normal kidney function on 13.@@ 2 m g , in the group with severe kidney function . &quot;
&quot; 12 liver functional disorders After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- P@@ ug@@ h classification A ) or medium @-@ severe ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h classification A ) or medium @-@ severe ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h classification ) , the C@@ max and AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and its metabolism was not significantly reduced compared to subjects with normal liver function . &quot;
age There were no significant changes in relation to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or of their metabol@@ ites according to the multi @-@ pl@@ ural doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , Mut@@ agen@@ ese , impair@@ ment of fer@@ til@@ ity in male rats , was found statistically significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( trans@@ itional cell pap@@ ill@@ ome and carcin@@ omas ) in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the high @-@ generation group , with approximately 11 @-@ fold exposure of exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are considered as a result of a specialized pur@@ in@@ itis and ur@@ anium composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been observed that Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertili@@ zation and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; with high doses , which were approximately 4,@@ 3 times of human therapeutic exposure , the maternal tox@@ icity , which entered with a reduction in breakdown and a development delay with the desc@@ endant of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in tra@@ cting rats with ex@@ positions , which were approximately 4.3 times and in tra@@ cting rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which were approximately 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , found no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are bre@@ eded ) in women after men@@ opause , with which a risk of low vitamin D levels exists . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or remove other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin supplement ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not wait until after the first intake of the day to take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
&quot; the company also led a study of 35 male and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase of vitamin D levels . &quot;
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated in patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those who exclusively produce alcohol ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also submitted data to indicate that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , precisely the dose which is needed for preventing bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the movement apparatus ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digest@@ ion apparatus such as abdominal pain , Dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ it ( digestive disorders ) , ul@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( ul@@ cer@@ ations ) , so@@ ot@@ ion ( ul@@ cer@@ ated stomach ) and aci@@ dic fatigue . &quot;
&quot; in patients with et@@ ins@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allergy ) against Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , vitamin D3 or any of the other elements , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in illnesses of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or patients who can not stand upright at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ anu@@ ary@@ 2007 , the European Commission awarded the company Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; Jack@@ me Ltd . approval for the administration of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule shaped , white and broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on the one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amin@@ ases ) for the day . &quot;
the following references are precisely determined to reduce the risk of cat@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swallowed up after the emergence of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) due to a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not take place prior to the first intake of the day to take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except for p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , only under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; sop@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al cords , were reported in patients under the in@@ gest@@ ation of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these were severe and required a hospital instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore att@@ enti@@ vely point to all signs and symptoms that are hin@@ dered on possible side effects , and the patients should be pointed out on the occurr@@ ence of symp@@ tom@@ atic irrit@@ ation like dy@@ mis , pain at swal@@ lowing or retro@@ spec@@ ular pain or to obtain medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe rheumato@@ id side effects seems to be increased in patients that do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms , which point to an ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all doses of dosage are given to patients and be understood by patients ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , rarely ( after market launch ) Mag@@ y@@ and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe problems and complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

&quot; there are no data available to indicate the not@@ ices , whether placing a bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients who dimin@@ ishes a j@@ aw surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ sis of the j@@ aw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the treatment doctor is crucial for the therapy planning in each patient on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be promp@@ ted that they should take the tablet to the following morning after taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after being noticed .
&quot; they should not take two tablets a day on the same day , but taking a tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day . &quot;
other illnesses that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before the beginning of therapy .
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ dr@@ on@@ at when they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait for at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken in clinical studies jointly with a variety of usually prescription drugs , without clinical relevant inter@@ actions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore not apply during pregnancy nor of lact@@ ating women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at do not have any indication of the effects on pregnancy and embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

studies using Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at once per week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was detected in one @-@ year multi @-@ year mul@@ tic@@ ist study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
effects of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at on bone mass and fra@@ cture response in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the Fra@@ ktur @-@ intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III studies the average ascent of BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to placebo after 3 years 8.8 % at the spine increased by 5.@@ 9 % at the spine as well as 7.8 % at the tro@@ phy .
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at Group , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to placebo 6.2 % ) were achieved with the proportion of people who suffered one or several vert@@ eb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D of the spine and Tro@@ pic@@ ter continued to remain ; also the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ale and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; in fit , there were two pl@@ az@@ eb@@ ok@@ er controlled trials , with which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily have been taken at either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the occurr@@ ence of at least one new vert@@ eb@@ rates by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption Be@@ verage to a intraven@@ ous reference dose , the mean oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was 0,@@ 64 % for dos@@ ages between 5 and 70 mg after child@@ birth and two hours prior to a standar@@ dised breakfast . &quot;
the bio@@ availability also increased to around 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the gift of oral Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily ) resulted in no clin@@ ically significant change of oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats revealed that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is split up after intraven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg in gr@@ abs , but then quickly spread out into the bones or by the urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ ert According to a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ one , approximately 50 % of the radioactive substance was eliminated within 72 hours of urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the threads . &quot;
&quot; according to a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance was not exceeded 200 ml / min . &quot;
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is eliminated in rats not by the aci@@ dic or bas@@ al transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not accepted that humans influences the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines through this transport systems .
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption For healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) was after the gift of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after a meal and two hours before taking a meal the average area under the serum concentration period ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D3 29@@ 6.4 ng / h / ml ( without having taken an endo@@ wed vitamin D3 mirror ) . &quot;
the mean maximum concentration in the serum ( C@@ max ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and the median time to reach the maximum concentration of concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
&quot; biot@@ opes vitamin D3 quickly becomes 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lic acid in the liver and then met@@ ering in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ di@@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 , the biolog@@ ically active form , met@@ abolic . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ ert in case of radioactive increased vitamin D3 to healthy subjects , the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the threads for 4 days 4,9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients with clinical studies have shown that the share of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , which is not stored in bones , is quickly separated by the urine . &quot;
&quot; although there are no clinical data about it , it is necessary to calculate that the ren@@ al elimination of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at would also be reduced in patients with reduced stress function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate can therefore be expected in patients with reduced stress function ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; Tre@@ mor ( trem@@ ors ) , headache , nausea / vomiting , diarrhea ( diar@@ rhoea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hypertension ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) and insom@@ nia ( insom@@ nia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with some sensitivity to T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( allergy ) against T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ id antibiotics ( such as ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines will be taken at the same time with Ad@@ vag@@ raf , as the Ad@@ vag@@ raf dose or the dose of adequate drug may need to be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ines yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow cap@@ s@@ top with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange cap@@ s@@ lap with &quot; &quot; EL@@ 6@@ 47 &quot; ; &quot; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy and treatment of transpl@@ ants should be noted or make changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transpl@@ ants transpl@@ ants or an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dose ; provisions of formulation or regime should only be performed under the m@@ asch@@ al control of one in the transpl@@ antation of experienced medical devices ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a consequence of conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dos@@ ages must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us remains unchanged . &quot;
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be primarily based on clinical assessment of shock absorption and toler@@ ability in individual cases and blood @-@ level provisions ( see below &quot; Recommend@@ ations
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ inas , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ks should be checked in front of the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , the systemic exposure was measured as valley mirror , comparable to both kidney or le@@ ber@@ ant patients . &quot;
&quot; careful and repeated checks of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ents are recommended during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation under Ad@@ vag@@ raf , to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate vicinity phase . &quot;
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first post @-@ operative phase , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) . &quot;
&quot; duration of application for the supp@@ ression of gra@@ fts , the immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified . &quot;
dose recommendations - kidney transpl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis for transpl@@ antation The oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift to the morning .
further Dos@@ age adjustments can be subsequently necessary because the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can change in the process of stabil@@ isation in patients after transpl@@ antation .
dose recommendations - liver transpl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis of transpl@@ antation The oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 @-@ 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; Dos@@ age recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf must become a gra@@ ft recei@@ vers of twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to once daily taking of Ad@@ vag@@ raf , this change@@ over in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the total daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transpl@@ ant After a change@@ over of other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va on Ad@@ vag@@ raf once daily must start treatment with the dose of corne@@ al and liver transpl@@ antation of the recommended initi@@ ation dose for proph@@ yla@@ xis of transpl@@ antation .
transpl@@ ant transpl@@ ant in adult patients who are asked at Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a oral initi@@ ation of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day to take part in the morning .
&quot; other transpl@@ ant cat@@ chers , although there is no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in pneum@@ onia , pancre@@ as and dar@@ mes transpl@@ ant patients , came to an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transpl@@ ant@@ aneous injection of 0.3 mg / kg / day and an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dose adap@@ tions in special patient groups Pati@@ ents with reduced liver function for maintaining blood tal@@ es in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a lowering of the dose .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function , as the kidney function does not ex@@ ert the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , it may be assumed that a dose adap@@ tion is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum samples , calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ dia and a monitoring of urine volume ) is recommended . &quot;
transformation from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in on ad@@ u@@ raf in the conversion of a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy must be careful ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the valley mirror in the whole blood the dose should be based on clinical assessment of shock absorption and toler@@ ability in individual cases under the help of thorough@@ bred T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ents controls .
it is recommended common checks of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ents during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation followed by perio@@ dic inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
&quot; blood @-@ level mirror of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us should also be checked after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , dose adap@@ tion , changes to immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy or for simultaneous use of substances that could change the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentrations ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; da Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments for the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady state has entered . &quot;
&quot; data in clinical studies conclude that a successful treatment in most cases is possible , if the valley mirror in the blood will not exceed 20 ng / ml . &quot;
in clinical practice the valley mirror of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us lie in full blood in the first time according to liver transpl@@ ant@@ ations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for ad@@ ren@@ al patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent detection of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac disease , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including transpl@@ ant impact or other side effects , which can occur in a row of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us Lower or Ex@@ pos@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dose ; provisions of formulation or regime should only be performed under the m@@ asch@@ al control of one in the transpl@@ antation of experienced medical devices ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with transpl@@ ant impact that proved to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ant formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; for proph@@ yla@@ xis , transpl@@ ant gra@@ fts in adult heart transpl@@ ants and gra@@ ft recei@@ vers in childhood are not yet present in clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ant formulation . &quot;
&quot; due to possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a lowering of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a breakdown of the clinical effect of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant enh@@ ancers during a treatment with vaginal sex ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rhoea , a particularly careful monitoring of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood is provided , as the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , it was described under Pro@@ gra@@ f as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy that can be observed as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy that can therefore occur under Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid burden and oil . &quot;
&quot; like with other immun@@ os@@ soup , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection using a high protective factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who are taking T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for pre@@ s such as heada@@ ches , changes of consciousness , sei@@ zu@@ res and vision problems should demonstrate a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; da Ad@@ vag@@ raf hard capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ines , lact@@ ose , is special attention in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary Gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , lact@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ lact@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medic@@ inal products known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may increase the metabolism of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and therefore reduce blood values of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or lower . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended to monitor the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels in the simultaneous gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism to monitor both the CY@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole , vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole , and pre@@ icon@@ az@@ ole , and with the Macro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal contamination , results . &quot;
high @-@ dose Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on as it is used for acute violations of the blood or lower the concentration of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
&quot; T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us effect on the metabolism of other medicines T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that have been met@@ alli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 whose metabolism is affected . &quot;
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tive , and thus increasing the hormone exposure is particularly c@@ auti@@ ous in decisions concerning contra@@ c@@ eption measures . &quot;
the results of animal tests have shown that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and Phen@@ az@@ on and extend its half @-@ life period .
the results of a low number of investigations on transpl@@ antation genetic information do not provide any indication that under T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va is an increased risk for un@@ wanted events in respect of the course and outcome of the pregnancy .
&quot; in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , a surveillance of new@@ bor@@ ns to the harmful effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( particularly with its effect on the kidneys ) is recommended . &quot;
&quot; it is the risk of premature birth ( weeks 37 ) and a hyper@@ lip@@ sing of the new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the tri@@ but@@ ing profile of Immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va is often observed due to the under@@ under@@ age of the patient and the same treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; below are the side effects after their frequency in decreasing order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( frequencies based on the available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;

cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated with leu@@ co@@ lic cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sources including therapy with Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
it has been reported via ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ op@@ las@@ m including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us treatment .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high bond of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and Plas@@ map@@ rot@@ ein can be assumed that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; the effects of action mechanism and the dynamic effects on the molecular level should be convey@@ ed by the effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us through its li@@ aison to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ical protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the en@@ rich@@ ment of the compound in the cell . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ ary dependent in@@ hibition of signal transactions in the T @-@ cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a particular series of lymp@@ ho@@ dg@@ kin genes .
&quot; T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and cells of T @-@ cells , the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ kin@@ en ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and g -@@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;

&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies published the observations expressed in the major studies in which pro@@ ces@@ ium in liver , kidney , and cardi@@ ac disease was used to primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; lung transpl@@ antation In an interim report on a recently run , multic@@ entr@@ e study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients who received either T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within a period of 1 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; chronic transpl@@ antation , bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis obl@@ iter@@ ation syndrome , was less frequent in the first year after the transpl@@ antation ( 2,@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rate after a year amounted to 8@@ 0.8 % in the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us patients , in 21.@@ 7 % of cases in the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis of obl@@ iter@@ ans fell to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) compared to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases where there was no acute gra@@ ft was observed after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) , for the l@@ ung@@ ed patients of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transpl@@ ant 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis obl@@ iter@@ ation syndrome was significantly lower in patients with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us patients . &quot;
&quot; pancre@@ atic surgery A multic@@ entr@@ e study was performed on 205 patients who received a random@@ ized process and kidney transpl@@ antation , which received a random@@ ized process T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) . &quot;
the oral initi@@ ation dose ( per protocol ) of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to reach the targeted valley level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; transpl@@ ant transpl@@ ant published in clinical results of a mono@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric study of oral transpl@@ ant@@ ations related to intestinal transpl@@ ant@@ ations in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ine and 25 multi @-@ vis@@ cer@@ al transpl@@ ant@@ ations ) under T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one demonstrated an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;

&quot; factors like a lower hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit@@ ate and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the non @-@ bound group of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , or by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the increased Clear@@ ance R@@ ates after transpl@@ antation . &quot;

&quot; adv@@ ances will be used for treating and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one due to lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems ) . &quot;
&quot; the application and the frequency of the application will be addressed , whether adv@@ ances for the treatment of bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood problems such as bleeding in joints , muscle , or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method used as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA &quot; technology : &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been applied to promote the formation of the human body factor VIII .
&quot; adv@@ ances is a member of the medicines approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is not different , so the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was studied with the prevention of bleeding as well as surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood vessels was awarded &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; well &quot; rated . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ise ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ances must not be applied to patients who possibly are exagger@@ ated ( allergic ) against human body factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster@@ protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the management of Adv@@ ent in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy are based on the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ deficiency , after the place and the extent of bleeding and clinical state . &quot;
&quot; in the following domestic rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma seal ( in % of the norm or in i.e. / dl ) . &quot;
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment has been removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of patients is over .
&quot; during treatment , the controller is calculated to control the dose and frequency of injec@@ tions a factor VIII @-@ plasma seal . &quot;
individual patients can be differenti@@ ated to factor VIII in their reaction to achieve different analysis times in vi@@ vo recovery .
&quot; 3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for the long term proph@@ yla@@ xis in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 , i.e. by factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days . &quot;
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma @-@ activities cannot be reached , or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out in order to detect an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that factor VIII is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the patient , a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alised antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known compensation in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; developing the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , where the risk is dependent within the first 20 Ex@@ positions of the largest and of genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ ne@@ stic content development , after changing from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , the restart of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors are observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurr@@ ence of the hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , the use of factor VIII stayed no experiences during pregnancy and nursing . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s were the inhibit@@ ors of inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who have previously untreated patients who have an higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( frequency on the basis of available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected decrease of blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII ( January 10 @-@ 14 ) post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient under contin@@ ous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was calculated during the whole time and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate were once again sufficient for the 15 postoperative day .
clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy up to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and anticipated exposure to 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ ATE demonstrated a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
&quot; moreover , at any of the 53 p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) , a tor@@ ment of VIII ( ≥ 50 days ) was diagnosed . &quot;
&quot; previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) were treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE against factor VIII . &quot;
the immune response of patients on traces of contam@@ inated proteins was analysed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statistically significant up@@ turn and a persist@@ ently peak of the anti @-@ chlorine @-@ cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that are caused to an allergic reaction or hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were random@@ ly reported on the occurr@@ ence of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ al gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes in several repeated product ex@@ positions in the study of the study . &quot;

&quot; based on the first permission of available data , the CH@@ MP has been evaluated the benefit risk - deliber@@ ation still as a positive , but in consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored by the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has been based on the A@@ DV@@ ATE safety profile , which requires a filing of P@@ SU@@ Rs every 6 months , decided that the authorisation has to request another renewal procedure for 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Human@@ ist Bo@@ ard@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company will withdraw its application for the management of adv@@ ancement of adv@@ ancement on the treatment of Li @-@ women &apos;s cancer . &quot;

&quot; it is a kind of virus that genetically modified , so it is possible to bear a gene in the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; in advance of the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , there is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; that has changed so it does not produce copies of themselves and therefore no infections can trigger in humans . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ances could be in@@ jected directly into the tum@@ ors , and to enable the cancer cells to form a normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein that is formed from the non @-@ defect in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells , if the DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer with which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not correct , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient prior to the Li @-@ women &apos;s cancer in the field of sub@@ strate , in bones and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers to the questions submitted to him , still some questions were un@@ explained . &quot;
&quot; based on the tests submitted , the CH@@ MP was created on Day 120 with a list of questions that will be added to the company . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ancement of adv@@ ancement in Li @-@ women men@@ i tum@@ ours are benefits for the patient . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the committee had concerns relating to the medicine in the body , the type of administration , and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not adequ@@ ately proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be made in a reliable way that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company won &apos;t know the CH@@ MP in knowledge of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients currently has clinical trials , or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; changed active release &quot; means that the tablets are so composed , that one of the most effective components is immediately released , and the other is released slowly over a few hours . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal rhin@@ itis ( hay fever due to an allergy against p@@ ollen of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ c@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; in adults and adolescents ages 12 , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze is twice a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water , or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may follow on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
major dimensions were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms that were reported from patients before the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all hay fever symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported patients , the Aer@@ in@@ aze income , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % compared to patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , patients under Aer@@ in@@ aze showed an alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients , the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot;

&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be applied in patients who may be re@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin or one of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ al active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( a different medicine for the treatment of aller@@ gies ) . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze also may not be used in patients who suffer blood pressure ( excessive water pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or v@@ ascular diseases ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hypertension ) , or a ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic strike ) or have a risk for a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted a approval for the placing of Aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is necessary to swal@@ low ( i.e. without it to bite to break or che@@ w ) . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze was to be applied because of the absence of data to un@@ question@@ able and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) not in children under 12 years .
&quot; the application duration is as short as possible , and should not continue to sound the symptoms . &quot;
it is recommended to limit the use of application for 10 days as at long @-@ term application the activity of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin can take away .
&quot; after the reduction of s@@ mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , treatment in demand with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be continued as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ ob@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mon@@ ol@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ etic activity of combined use of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ aders such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ ppl@@ ing , Per@@ go@@ id , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , eff@@ ot@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other dec@@ on@@ gest@@ iv@@ a ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ yl@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient collection , and the data is not sufficient to address the recommendations for dosage . &quot;
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and the data is not sufficient to address the recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment with occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ ton@@ ia , or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as heada@@ ches or a rein@@ forcement of heada@@ ches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the following patient groups is advis@@ able to be careful : • Pati@@ ents with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes mell@@ itus , bladder chemicals or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze has at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests as anti@@ hist@@ amine , otherwise positive reactions to prevent positive reactions to the indicators of bon@@ ding actions , respectively . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given additionally , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , there were no significant differences between that with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was not identified yet so that inter@@ actions with other medicines can not be excluded .
&quot; des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ sist@@ ence of the application of aer@@ in@@ ists during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase the frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison to the frequency of normal population . &quot;
reproductive studies of animals not always transfer to humans and due to vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ cting properties of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine it should not be applied in pregnancy .
&quot; however , patients should be explained clearly that in very rare cases it may come to a dizz@@ ness , which can lead to an impair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ no@@ e , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ ision ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( insom@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ k , con@@ vul@@ sions ) . &quot;
&quot; heada@@ ches , anxiety , frigh@@ tening of Mik@@ tion , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ ths , pal@@ pit@@ ations , pal@@ pit@@ ations , nausea , vomiting , cor@@ related pain , dizziness , t@@ innitus , respiratory disturb@@ ances , and hyper@@ ton@@ ia or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a CN@@ S @-@ stim@@ ulation is especially likely among children , as well as A@@ trop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( oral dry , pup@@ ill@@ ary ar@@ re and - dil@@ at@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing expression of the expression of the Ad@@ duc@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ean P @-@ selection . &quot;
&quot; at a single @-@ dose study of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg is no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks that are associated with flying . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day has no higher frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ ometer , or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S @-@ ar@@ ous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , hist@@ amine @-@ agon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined using the overall co@@ res for the symp@@ tom@@ atic ( except for nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ c@@ al swelling ) , significantly higher than in mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin about the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined using the nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ c@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine via the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
as part of a single dose @-@ trial for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow @-@ balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was reached in day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi@@ disciplinary study conducted with the formulation of healthy adult subjects , has been noted that four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine badly mis@@ changed . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin after the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was the exposure after the gift of a Aer@@ in@@ aze tray .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , for tox@@ icity at repeated treatment , for Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and to reproductive @-@ tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may recognize any special dangers for human beings . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin . &quot;
&quot; in reproductive @-@ reproductive studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin / P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in the oral gift of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day is not ter@@ at@@ ogenic . &quot;

&quot; for children ages 1 to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup respectively . &quot;
&quot; for children ages six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients , which also had asthma patients ) . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of quad@@ rant , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) before and after six weeks of treatment was determined . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to remove and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application for children un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us a mean decrease of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) increased by 25 to 32 % compared with a decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria the decline of symptoms came after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who possibly are exagger@@ ated ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the Company SP Europe approval for the management of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to relie@@ ve symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials on the efficacy of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week , or less than 4 weeks ) should be done accordingly to the previous disease and can be resum@@ ed after de@@ formation of symptoms and resum@@ ed . &quot;
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( onset of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) may be recommended to receive a continuous treatment during the All@@ ergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets were given in addition to those Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see below Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , ag@@ eri@@ us and alcohol has not been intensi@@ fied by the effec@@ tiv@@ ating effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 , see below 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be explained above that in very rare cases , that it may result in very rare cases , which can lead to an impair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events that were reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , oral dry ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most frequent pre@@ side effects occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , treated with 6.9 % of the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multiple dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing expression of the expression of the Ad@@ jun@@ k molecules in End@@ othel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg per day , there was not statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold in the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dos@@ is@@ - study of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg is no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks that are associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; patients with allergic rhin@@ itis was A@@ eri@@ us effective in alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week , or less than 4 weeks . &quot;
consistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the overall co@@ res for the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us is effectively reduced by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was identified as representative of other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology are de@@ emed similar to the e@@ ti@@ ology in different forms and chronic patients can be recruited by pro@@ spective . &quot;
&quot; because the hist@@ amine release is a urs@@ ing factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin except for the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria is also confirmed in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria in other forms of clinical guidelines . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective for improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the suspension of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose intervals . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , was excluded from the study . &quot;
improvement of the it@@ iner@@ ary for more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disturb@@ ance of the sleeping and qu@@ int@@ ity significantly as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluation of these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients comparable to patients with the general seasonal rhin@@ itis -@@ population was comparable , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
there are no basis points for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5 @-@ 20 mg ) more than 14 days before .
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , however , was not identified yet so that interaction with other medicines will not be excluded . &quot;
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dos@@ ing study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) is not shown on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the result with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ adin result in clinical studies , with a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences concerning the tox@@ icity of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and from Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity , repeated treatment , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and reprodu@@ ci@@ x@@ icity can be seen no particular dangers for human beings . &quot;
&quot; colour@@ less film ( includes L@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mon@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ate , Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , Titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indig@@ oc@@ ar@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hy@@ m@@ m@@ less , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relie@@ ve symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescription doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are present to support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis should play a role in diagn@@ osing the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin testing . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 are met@@ abolic des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and find out a higher substance loading ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ erial sy@@ rup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 , which are to be restricted , is identical with the children that met@@ alli@@ ze normally . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with genetic problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose absor@@ bing , or a suc@@ rose in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in the context of clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets that were given in the Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see below Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , ag@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol has not been reinforced with the effective effects of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ erial sy@@ rup group as well as in the placebo group .
&quot; clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , for which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between the ages of 1 and 11 , who came to question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between the ages of 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because of the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold in the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents had no higher frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
&quot; in a single daily dose of 7,5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies , there is no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it was not affected by the simultaneous intake of alcohol to an increase of alcohol @-@ induced power generation to increase the drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , drun@@ kenn@@ ess , and it@@ ching of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the overall co@@ res for the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets decreased by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis under seasonal rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective for improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the suspension of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose intervals . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Caucas@@ ians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tical multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup forms of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis in restricted met@@ abolic disorders .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was about 6 to 6 hours about 6 times higher and the C@@ max . 3 to 4@@ times higher with a termin@@ ale half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no basis points for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient @-@ cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5 @-@ 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 @-@ in different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine during p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , however , was not identified yet so that interaction with other medicines can not be excluded . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. was officially distributed to the Committee for Human@@ ist Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company receives its application for the management of A@@ fl@@ in@@ ov to prevent avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and older people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ im@@ ov should be applied in adults and older people to protect influenza that is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine , which could cause a strain of influenza virus , which could cause future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can be easily spread by man because there is no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system contained the parts of the influenza virus as &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is able to form faster antibodies to a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; afterwards the membrane sleeve of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m surface , det@@ ects the human body as a body ) , was cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of clinical data base for the assessment of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the guidelines for the EMEA region for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical study and require further information about your treatment , please contact your treat@@ able doctor . &quot;
&quot; for more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , infected with human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which caused the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for induc@@ ing , but this can not be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the security of this combination was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; A@@ he@@ ase should only be classified if the doctor has checked , which has taken an an@@ tivir@@ al medicine of the patient who has taken the virus to address the medicine . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily that are taken together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily and with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs .
&quot; in children between four and twelve years of age and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ quar@@ ase is calculated according to body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood , and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS is not too healing , however , the damage of the immune system and so the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases can also be hes@@ it@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; A@@ he@@ ase has been studied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , studied in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; with low do@@ si@@ ated Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medic@@ inal pharmac@@ euticals , the former prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or . &quot;
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ proven concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of the viral load after the treatment .
&quot; in the studies involving patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ he@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ he@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but of the children who previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or were only very few on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving adults who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , the viral load increased by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger decrease of the viral load after four weeks , compared to the patients who continued their previous release inhibit@@ or : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhoea ( diarrhea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( bladder ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , skin rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ he@@ ase may not be applied in patients , which may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ id@@ avi@@ r or any of the other elements . &quot;
&quot; A@@ he@@ ase should also not be applied in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines which are equally the same as A@@ he@@ ase and are affected in high concentrations in the blood health harmful . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines against HIV , patients who are taking aging against HIV , the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( alter@@ ations in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ re activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection that caused by the relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ist Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of aging in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; A@@ he@@ ase is generally taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee noted that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; A@@ he@@ ase was originally admitted under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to permit marketing auth@@ orization to the member of the EU in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ prescribed adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; for typically , A@@ he@@ ase capsules are supposed to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic boost of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and the patient &apos;s pre@@ treatment ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio availability of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r as a solution is reduced by 14 % lower than am@@ id@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ he@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ mal capsules is 600 mg am@@ id@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If aging capsules without the ampli@@ fication of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) must be applied , higher doses of A@@ he@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ mal capsules is 20 mg am@@ id@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ id@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of a@@ quar@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ he@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the absence of data to un@@ question@@ able and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data , the dose of A@@ mal capsules in adult patients with intermediate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions are reduced to 300 mg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use is supposed to be treated with mild or moderate liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function . it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ he@@ ase may not also be given at the same time with pharmac@@ euticals , which have a small therapeutic width and furthermore sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ y 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; herbal preparations , which contain the cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , may not be applied because of the risk of reducing plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients should be noted that A@@ he@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to cure the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of a HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ he@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination using blood .
&quot; for typically , A@@ he@@ ase capsules are supposed to be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy have an increased risk of severe liver inter@@ actions with potentially fatal course .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with existing reduced liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy and should be monitored accordingly to clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ids , which can be confused by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , it is not recommended that the benefits of a treatment the risk of systemic co@@ cor@@ p@@ ic effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the side effects ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; because the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of aging with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that may cause serious or threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ yl@@ actic , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; for patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ he@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma bars ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interaction with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the effects of inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ el@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ al symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of tox@@ icity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ ation of tox@@ icity , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under a age of four years and should be used with caution with certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; A@@ he@@ ase should be reduced to duration 5 , if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , was reported on the occurr@@ ence of diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ az@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes mell@@ itus . &quot;
&quot; many of the patients had other diseases , whose therapy medicines were necessary , associated with the development of diabetes mell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; a higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , associated with the met@@ abolic disorders associated with pharmac@@ ogen@@ ous factors . &quot;
&quot; in ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ ity , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop a inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ ist infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial e@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , were reported cases of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ sis in particular in patients with advanced HIV condition and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of aging may not be given at the same time with drugs that have a small therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ y 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r cannot be used together with drugs , whose active ingredients are predominantly connected over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and causes resistance development .
&quot; in trying to balance the hum@@ ili@@ ation level by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often un@@ wanted effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be rev@@ iled by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already takes John &apos;s wort , the Am@@ end@@ av@@ irus mirror and , if possible , check the vir@@ us@@ load and depos@@ e the cur@@ rant . &quot;
a dose custom@@ ization for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fav@@ ored bottom ) .
&quot; in combination with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 100 mg twice a day ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ el@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg am@@ id@@ avi@@ r have been used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove their effectiveness and in@@ convenience of this treatment schem@@ ati@@ as . &quot;
&quot; if am@@ id@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) , in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ) was administered twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which was reached by am@@ id@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , is approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ id@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dos@@ ing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is not recommended to have a close monitoring , because the effectiveness and in@@ capable of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in is recommended , however , due to the ant@@ acid component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the income of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ene and ag@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acids below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with E@@ gre@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is not required . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ gre@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would mean .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing limited data can suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin may possibly reduces the serum concentration of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if this medicine should be used simultaneously , caution is provided because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are applied together , caution is commanded ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made , as an exact forecast of the effect of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r effect is difficult in Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ c@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ g in around 193 % and thus contributing to a rise of associated side effects .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , it is necessary to invo@@ ke Ri@@ g in together with A@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic studies with an@@ em@@ ase in combination with Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin could not be performed but the plasma concentration of both medicines could be increased in the same period of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ab@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ FU ) once daily without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ou@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied to inter@@ actions together with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; the patients should therefore be connected to toxic reactions , which are associated with these drugs , if they are used in combination with an@@ ai@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ he@@ ase , as it can occur to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va that are known as enzyme production ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r may lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of the plasma bars of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentration of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ el@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ b@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ b@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ vo@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ id@@ avi@@ r , which may increase activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous taking with A@@ he@@ ase , its plasma concentration can increase considerably and rein@@ force with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ out , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted in Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 μ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , the fluid c@@ ort@@ is@@ ol grew significantly , while the endo@@ gene c@@ ort@@ is@@ ol grew by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ rate interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of aging with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in together with these glucose co@@ ids is not recommended , unless the benefits of a treatment over@@ weighs the risk of systemic co@@ cor@@ p@@ ic effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which depends heavily on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are distinct enh@@ ancements of plasma quality at the same time period of aging . &quot;
&quot; because plasma increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors on My@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , is not recommended to use this medicine with am@@ el@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations can be recommended up to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can be increased by am@@ id@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ generic ase may not be applied together with oral ten@@ sion@@ ed Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while the use of A@@ he@@ ase with par@@ ven@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am must be careful . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma bars of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 @-@ 4 g@@ ou@@ ache .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ al symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the very low reliability of historical clubs , no recommendation can be given , such as the Am@@ end@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose is when am@@ id@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies , together with A@@ he@@ ase , a reinforced control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised debt ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a reduction or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive is not predic@@ table ; therefore alternative methods for contra@@ c@@ eption is recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous gift of aging ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r related substances were detected in milk in@@ activated rats , but it is not known whether am@@ id@@ avi@@ r is over with people in the breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given to Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r &apos;s income in the u@@ terus to the end of the breast@@ feeding time , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight during the breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the further development of the income including fertili@@ zation and reproductive ability was not affected by the administration of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r to the breast .
the in@@ suffici@@ ency of A@@ he@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the A@@ he@@ ase @-@ treatment @-@ effects associated side effects were slightly until moderately , occurred early and rarely demonstrated to treatment . &quot;
&quot; with many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are related to HIV medicine or another at the same time to HIV medicine , or whether they are a result of the under@@ age disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side @-@ side effects are taken from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , patients received 1200 mg of A@@ har@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were used by the audit as associated with study medication , and recorded at more than 1 % of patients , as well as the treatment of the laboratory @-@ changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of higher and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , increased intra@@ ocular and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral fat collection ( Sti@@ cker ) . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral targets not pre @-@ treated persons , who had been treated with am@@ id@@ y@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over a medium duration of 36 weeks , was only one case ( Sti@@ cker ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - treated patients under am@@ id@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) , in combination with different N@@ RT@@ Is for a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; normally , skin rash were usually slightly until moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ al nature , with or without it@@ ching and compet@@ ed spont@@ aneously within two weeks without being canc@@ eled the treatment with am@@ el@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ ek@@ sis cases were particularly reported in patients with general risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ ity , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop a inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infection ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients , which were 600 mg of A@@ he@@ ase twice a day , combined with low do@@ si@@ ated Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 and 4 ) of those who received under sole suffering from tri@@ glyceri@@ de and CP@@ K values in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low do@@ si@@ ated Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were very frequent . &quot;
&quot; in case of an over@@ dosage , the patient is able to observe signs of an in@@ tox@@ icated ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary necessary supporting measures . &quot;

&quot; the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both on acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ ast@@ ical cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as to peripher@@ al blood @-@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ o@@ con@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm for acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm for chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not defined yet .

analysis of gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistance .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ A , I@@ 54@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ F , M@@ 36@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ F , M@@ 36@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , with reduced probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to changes due to additional data and it is recommended to always follow the current inter@@ pret@@ ations for analysis of resistance tests .
based on ph@@ otyp@@ ic resist@@ ence @-@ based analysis clinical vali@@ dated analysis systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for the estimate of activity of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistance .
&quot; firms which drive diagnostic resistance tests , clin@@ ically developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( separ@@ ations ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to evaluate results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; each four with reduced sensitivity to am@@ id@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross@@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r , however , remains in general . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ id@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of five @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral targets for patients with whom a Fos@@ amp@@ ab@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and typ@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates at ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and the type of resistance mut@@ ations to the ins@@ ulator . &quot;
early sl@@ ump of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries which can affect the following treatment .
&quot; the proof of the efficacy of A@@ he@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 ( viral load ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) , and Nu@@ cle@@ o@@ sid@@ analogue ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with a minimal ri@@ fl@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and thre@@ e@@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ he@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the research study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis set the non @-@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in terms of time @-@ adjusted average change from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma to 16 weeks , with a non @-@ lower threshold of 0,4 @-@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the proof of the efficacy of un@@ born a@@ wing is based on two un@@ controlled trials , with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 had been pre @-@ treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution was administered three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and 22,5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; there was no low do@@ si@@ sted Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r simultaneously ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) . &quot;
19 Based on this data should be considered to be considered with PI to be considered to be expected to be considered by the expected benefit of &quot; illeg@@ itim@@ ate &quot; aging .
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) until the maximum serum concentration of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; for up to 30 % , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was lowered by am@@ id@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ inst@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves on a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration from am@@ id@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissues .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , where the amount of un@@ bound am@@ id@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active proportion , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of non @-@ connected am@@ id@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active substances in the ste@@ ady state fluctu@@ ates in the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 needs to be induc@@ ted or in@@ hib@@ ited the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strate , with caution when they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice , or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r exposure like in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r is a solution of 14 % less bio@@ availability than out of capsules ; therefore , A@@ he@@ ase Solution and A@@ mal capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ meter basis . &quot;
&quot; even the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , so the effect of a ren@@ al function is likely to be reduced to the elimination of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ id@@ avi@@ r plasma standards , comparable to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ id@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats occurred with male animals ben@@ evol@@ ving he@@ als ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ id@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 based mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ als of o@@ cellular Aden@@ omas and Kar@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been explained and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , there are little evidence for the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings in clinical trials , both from clinical trials and therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial inhibit@@ ing tests ( Am@@ es @-@ test ) , micro@@ core test to rats and chromosome deriv@@ ation test was am@@ ylo@@ id neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical studies by AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; previously , no significant liver tox@@ icity was observed in clinical trials , neither during administration of A@@ he@@ ase is still after the end of treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies of tox@@ icity in young , which were treated with an age of 4 days , showed both in the control of the control as well as with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r @-@ animals a high mortality . &quot;
&quot; in a systematic plasma exposure that was significantly higher ( rats ) or significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ ong@@ ation and lower skel@@ eton changes were observed for delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If aging capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fication of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of A@@ he@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ mal capsules is 20 mg am@@ id@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ id@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous use should be applied in patients with weak or mild liver problems with caution , in patients with severe liver function . it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that may cause serious or threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ yl@@ actic , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; A@@ he@@ ase should be set up on duration 27 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , associated with the met@@ abolic disorders associated with drug @-@ dependent factors . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and causes resistance development .
&quot; in combination with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 100 mg twice a day ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ el@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which was reached by am@@ id@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , is approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ id@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dos@@ ing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is not recommended to have a close monitoring , because the effectiveness and in@@ capable of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ gre@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would mean .
&quot; if these drugs are applied together , caution is commanded ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made , as an exact forecast of the effect of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r effect is difficult in Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , it is necessary to invo@@ ke Ri@@ g in together with A@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; serum concentration of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ el@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ b@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ b@@ di@@ pin , n@@ m@@ di@@ pin , n@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ id@@ avi@@ r , allowing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted in Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 μ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , the fluid c@@ ort@@ is@@ ol grew significantly , while the endo@@ gene c@@ ort@@ is@@ ol grew by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ rate interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies , together with A@@ he@@ ase , a reinforced control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised debt ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a reduction or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous administration of orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ thin@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by am@@ id@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was given to am@@ id@@ st in the u@@ terus to the end of the lact@@ ation time am@@ id@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the in@@ suffici@@ ency of A@@ he@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of an over@@ dosage , the patient is able to observe signs of an in@@ tox@@ icated ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both on acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ ast@@ ical cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood @-@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ o@@ con@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm for acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm for chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µg / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates at ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and the type of resistance mut@@ ations to the ins@@ ulator . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , the treatment optimization is expected to be considered with PI to be considered to be expected to be considered by &quot; illeg@@ itim@@ ate &quot; aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of non @-@ connected am@@ id@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active substances in the ste@@ ady state generally fluctu@@ ates in the range of C@@ max , ss to c@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 needs to be induc@@ ted or in@@ hib@@ ited the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strate , with caution when they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a ren@@ al function is likely to be reduced to the elimination of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats occurred with male animals ben@@ evol@@ ving he@@ als ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure at people after twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ id@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ avi@@ ular Aden@@ omes and Kar@@ cin@@ omas , and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; however , out of the present position data on humans , both clinical trials and therapeutic application showed a little not@@ ices for the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial mutation test ( Am@@ es @-@ test ) , micro@@ core test to rats and chromosome deriv@@ ation test was am@@ ylo@@ id neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies of tox@@ icity in young , which were treated with an age of 4 days , showed both in the control of the control as well as with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r @-@ animals a high mortality . &quot;
&quot; these results indicate that in young the metabolism of the metabolism is not fully mature , so that am@@ id@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of formulation ( z ) . &quot;

the benefits of with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase Solution could not take place either with PI pre @-@ treated patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
&quot; the bio availability of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r as a solution is reduced by 14 % lower than am@@ id@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ he@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules immediately after taking the solution to taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2800 mg am@@ id@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since there is no dose recommended for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for joining and low @-@ si@@ ated Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adap@@ tor for am@@ id@@ avi@@ r is not necessary , a application of A@@ mal solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic response as a result of the high propylene glyco@@ l content , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated for infants and children under the age of 4 , with pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration can lead to a competent inhibit@@ or of metabolism of this drug and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects as ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ he@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to cure the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of a HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ he@@ ase does not prevent the risk of developing HIV at other via sexual contact or contamination using blood .
&quot; for some medicines that may cause serious or threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; A@@ he@@ ase should be reduced to duration if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors such as a lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , associated with the met@@ abolic disorders associated with pharmac@@ ogen@@ ous disorders . &quot;
&quot; in ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ sen . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and causes resistance development .
&quot; in combination with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 100 mg twice a day ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ el@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous taking with A@@ he@@ ase , its plasma concentration can be considerably increased and lead to P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ out , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
based on data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors are expected to significantly higher plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take effect may not be applied because of any toxic reactions of the etus to the contained propylene glyco@@ l ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r related substances were detected in milk in@@ activated rats , but it is not known whether am@@ id@@ avi@@ r is over with people in the breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction of reproduction to toler@@ ant rats , who was given to am@@ id@@ st in the u@@ terus to the end of the lact@@ ation time am@@ id@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 55 body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
the in@@ suffici@@ ency of A@@ he@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; with many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are related to HIV medicine or another at the same time to HIV medicine , or whether they are a result of the under@@ age disease . &quot;

the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a big ring volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration from am@@ id@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissues .

it should be eff@@ ected in these patients between the benefit of a treatment using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk of transpl@@ anting or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction .
&quot; two cases of severe Phi@@ mos@@ is were carried out in other studies in which there were no symptoms of severe Phi@@ mos@@ is , and a case with a leading Stri@@ cture was observed . &quot;
&quot; in case of application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream in higher than the recommended doses , an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation were observed , which require treatment necessary and / or to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties in water , which required an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and a treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous injec@@ tions for the treatment of external fe@@ ti@@ ces in the genital and peri@@ an@@ al@@ ment , there are no clinical experience so far . &quot;
&quot; limited data suggest an increased rate of increase reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream has shown in this patient group in relation to the elimination of the ti@@ lt . however , a lower efficacy is shown . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ tor@@ o@@ od within 1 cm to eyel@@ ids , the nose , lips or hair set was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are common , but intensity of these reactions take place in general during therapy or reactions form the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the symptoms of patients or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made by several days . &quot;
&quot; after the regeneration of the treated , the clinical outcome of the treatment can be judged approximately 12 weeks after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; as currently , no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment are available , other suitable therapy forms should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs there are no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study point out that large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower probability of contact to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ tor@@ o@@ od has not been studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ os@@ ities on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or in the lip@@ stick field . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osen in anatom@@ ical positions outside the facial and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the acute ker@@ at@@ osis in the lower arms and hands will not support the effectiveness in this application purpose , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions normally take effect on intensity , or go back after finishing the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin inter@@ actions are large un@@ eas@@ iness , or very strong , the treatment can be suspended for some days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 acu@@ ity les@@ ions reveal a lower healing rate than patients suffering from less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream should be used with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not go directly or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ öt@@ al development , de@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one of the appropriate top@@ ical use of quanti@@ fi@@ able serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given for use during a breast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; most frequently included , and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream related side effects in studies with three weeks of actual treatment were local reactions to the place of the treatment of the F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ tor@@ o@@ od patients ) . &quot;
&quot; most commonly reported and possibly , or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ spread of side effects include symptoms of application with an incidence of 28,@@ 1 % . &quot;
&quot; the patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream treated Bas@@ ali@@ om patients from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below . &quot;
&quot; the most common , probably , or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ spread in connection to these studies were a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of the patients treated with ion i@@ od@@ i@@ od@@ ine ) . &quot;
the adverse events that were given by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
&quot; according to the evaluation plan , the evaluation of clinical signs shows that in this placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream frequently used to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion / leaf@@ lets ( 23 % ) and oil ( 14 % ) and ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to study schedule , this evaluation of clinical signs shows that in these studies , with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream spreads very frequently to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and to severe w@@ rest@@ ation and c@@ ession ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies investig@@ ating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) on treatment or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the exceptional one @-@ off image of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect that occurred according to several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was norm@@ alized in hyp@@ ot@@ onia that norm@@ alized itself to oral or intraven@@ ous liquid . &quot;
&quot; following the top@@ ical use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , the concentration of the alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es were detected following the top@@ ical use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in 3 allow@@ able Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete recovery of the in@@ clin@@ ations at an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is superior to a placebo treatment over 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; for 60 % of all 119 patients with im@@ bur@@ i@@ od@@ ine treated patients , the F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts recovered completely ; this one was 20 % of the 105 with placebo @-@ treated patients in the case ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete press release could be reached at 23 % from 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ tor@@ o@@ od at 5 @-@ time applications per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; hist@@ ologically confirmed individual super @-@ specific bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm . &quot;
&quot; the data from an open , controlled long @-@ term study according to four years , show that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI &#91; 95 % CI &#93; ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; were clin@@ ically grown and that remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od occurred with three weeks of weekly application in one or two treatment rooms of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week period , treated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically distinct , visible , discreet , non @-@ hyper@@ sp@@ at@@ otic membrane , not hyper@@ tro@@ phic accent inside a related 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area on the un@@ hair@@ y scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
one @-@ year data from two combined observ@@ ational studies show a recur@@ ren@@ al rate of 27 % compared to one or two treatment rooms ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the approved indications , mem@@ or@@ can and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma occur normally at pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients normally and were therefore not studied . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream has been studied in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies in children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ tor@@ o@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the evaluated doses ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimum systemic intake of 5 % i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream through the skin of 58 patients with ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest pharmaceutical concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face ( 25 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the estimated half @-@ life time was approximately 10@@ times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ term after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; which points to an extended re@@ tention of the drug in the skin .
&quot; data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine according to top@@ ical application on MC @-@ induced skin of patients , aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to with healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal tox@@ icity , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg were reduced significantly reduced body weight and increased Mil@@ z @-@ weight ; a study carried out for four months , resulting in the mouse no similar effects . &quot;
a two @-@ year @-@ old study of carcin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice increased no tum@@ ors at three days a week .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but I@@ mi@@ tor@@ o@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and not mut@@ agen@@ ess is a risk for people due to the systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors were treated in the group of mice that was treated with the real cream , previously and in larger number than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

&quot; in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , however , its effectiveness was measured ( by reducing its effect in relation to reducing the G@@ ag concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine around 60 % , and half of the treated children diagnosed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , stomach pain , pain in the lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sense , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me may not be applied greatly in patients who possibly react sensiti@@ vely to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) is every year , all new information which may be announced , check and upgrade this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is received patients who receive al@@ dur@@ ac@@ me as regards the reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the management of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in the entire European Union . &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ al cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ ven , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with proven diagnosis of a Mu@@ es@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ de I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) , in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should be done by a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary met@@ abolic diseases . &quot;
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for adults over 65 years was not established , and for these patients no dosage may be recommended . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dosage may be recommended . &quot;
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , these patients should continue to be monitored continuously , and in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be done in a reasonable clinical environment in which re@@ launch facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 clinical trial , almost all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are normally expected , usually within 3 months of treatment start . &quot;
&quot; patients , the antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as little experience in the treatment after a longer period , due to the theoretical risk reaction , it must be c@@ auti@@ ous due to the theoretical risk reaction after interrup@@ ting the treatment . &quot;
&quot; 60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ thon ) , to minim@@ ize the potential appearance of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions . &quot;
&quot; in case of mild or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or reducing the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are produced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to consider . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be recorded again with reducing the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ter , because there is a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular recording of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect imp@@ lications for pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there were no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase about breast milk , is recommended to silent during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; adverse reactions were used in clinical trials , mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) were observed . &quot;
un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some cases with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions came out , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , respiratory failure and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug effects associated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , which were reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under the age of 5 , reported mainly severe deteri@@ oration and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , over 3 months after the start of treatment , it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version , with a heavier exchange rate usually came within a month to a Ser@@ ok@@ on version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until an early departure from the study ) were det@@ ectable , in 13 / 45 patients with radio@@ immun@@ op@@ re@@ cip@@ ation ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients with which it never came to server version . &quot;
&quot; patients with lack of low @-@ body levels have a robust reduction in the G@@ ag @-@ mir@@ s in Har@@ n , while patients with high antibody tit@@ res can be found to determine a variable reduction in G@@ ag in Har@@ n . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed mar@@ g@@ inal up to low @-@ neutral em@@ or@@ ical effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro that seemed to affect the efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies appeared not in connection with the incidence of un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions , even if the occurr@@ ence of un@@ wanted drug groups typically fell along with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of an additional accumulation of en@@ forcement .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most prob@@ able via man@@ tle @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recruited for the study , which refers to the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient pointed to the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recruited when they had a for@@ c@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
primary end@@ points for effectiveness were the percentage change in expect@@ ation FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
&quot; all patients were subsequently recruited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; after 26 weeks therapy , patients treated with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ me treated patients with the placebo group improvement in the lung function and the ability to display in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in the open renewal study , an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as seen from the following table . &quot;
the decrease of the percentage FE@@ V is highly significant over this period and the absolute lung capacity increased substantially to the body @-@ size of the children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a hepat@@ ocy@@ st before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) , reaching a normal liver size by the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste of the G@@ ag @-@ Mir@@ ror in Har@@ n ( µg / mg Kre@@ at@@ inin ) was detected , which remained constant until the study period . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ gene@@ ous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients who were taken into account by using a combined final FE@@ V , the clin@@ ically significant changes of five efficacy variable ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a decrease in 9 patients ( 20 % ) observed . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined at 20 patients who were under the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the severe circulation form and 4 with the middle exp@@ iry form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dos@@ ing was increased due to elevated gas levels in Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined after the Z @-@ Score for the age group . the younger patients with severe deteri@@ oration of age ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe de@@ br@@ is form is only limited , or no progress in the cogn@@ itive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , investigations were carried out on the g@@ ag levels of various al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms met@@ ering schem@@ ata on the g@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be represented in patients who have difficulties with weekly advertis@@ ements , represent an acceptable alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ ati@@ ata is equivalent to . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) is granted any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug is updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to the patients affected by older and less affected patients .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in one @-@ time gift , tox@@ icity , and repeat@@ able treatment , the pre @-@ clinical data can be seen no particular dangers for human beings . &quot;

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technology ) • J@@ e after body weight of each patient first determine the number of di@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant bottles .
A@@ lim@@ ta will be used together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( another drug against cancer ) if the cancer is not re@@ se@@ al@@ able ( due to an operation alone can not be removed ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( due to an operation alone can not be removed ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer who does not attacks the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who previously had not been treated , in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously received other chemicals involved as sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should use cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as folic acid ( vitamin B12 ) and folic acid ( vitamin B12 ) . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is given to C@@ is@@ plat@@ in should be given before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in addition , an &quot; Anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( medicines against vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid deficiency ) . &quot;
&quot; patients whose blood @-@ image changes , or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be pushed , removed or the dose may be reduced . &quot;
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is thus slow@@ ed down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
&quot; the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier compared to cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations in the active form of the drug and a longer reaction time in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease previously . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( a further medicine for cancer ) , while both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in was found in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
&quot; patients who had previously received chemotherapy was compared with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared to 7.9 months in Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; however , in both studies , patients with whom cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ium in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer than with the compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission approved the company Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. for the management of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
each linear bottle has to be checked with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - sis is taken from the per@@ imeter bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in indicated to first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic , non @-@ small @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma except for over@@ l@@ apping epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ ally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small @-@ cell bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma except for superior performance epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small @-@ cell bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of hood , the day before and the day of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed gift as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid are given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid , and intake should be continued during the entire duration of therapy , as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need to receive in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re dose and after each third process cycle .
&quot; in patients who receive p@@ em@@ etry , a complete blood picture should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ ocy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ n@@ yt@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose of dose must be taking place in the Nadi@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous treatment of therapy . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to references to tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 blood flow .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted by the patient , before the treatment &quot;
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled when in patients after 2 dos@@ ing reductions or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - at the occurr@@ ence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or in comparison to patients aged 65 years of age there is an increased tri@@ chlor@@ o@@ il@@ - ko .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to un@@ adequate data for un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness .
clinical studies were required for patients with a cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min . dose to be required for all patients recommended Dos@@ age adjustments .
&quot; the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
however patients with a liver function reduced by &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold in the upper edge value and / or tran@@ sam@@ in@@ as@@ en@@ values of &gt; 3.0 fold in the upper limit value ( at presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value ( by presence of liver metast@@ ases ) are not particularly studied in studies .
&quot; patients must not be supervised on the bone of the bone market and not to be administered to patients , before whose absolute neut@@ ro@@ phi@@ lic count once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
a dose @-@ reduction for more cycles is based on the Nadi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ofing count and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles . ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction in Grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity , such as neutr@@ alised neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , was considered to be a pre @-@ treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients must be instructed to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a proph@@ esi@@ ate measure to reduce tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake non @-@ ster@@ oid antibodies ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , intended for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ a , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ term treatment for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients experienced these events , corresponding risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
therefore patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid buil@@ du@@ p in trans@@ cellular space should be considered to be a drainage of the eff@@ ac@@ ity before P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were usually reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of sha@@ ding ai@@ ds ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible Schä@@ fer that consists of reproductive ability due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be noted prior to treatment - casting out advis@@ ing with respect to the semen order . &quot;
patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can lead high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid antibodies ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) .
therefore caution is provided if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy on the day of therapy and under@@ taking ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; since there are no data regarding the re@@ ac@@ tionary potential as with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ life time , such as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - are avoided . &quot;
the major in@@ tra @-@ individual variation of the poor status in the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ tivir@@ al and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires a higher monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Standards Organization ) when the decision was made to treat the patient du@@ cks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ itis .
&quot; there are no data on the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed with pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ tim@@ et@@ abol@@ ites are expected during an application during pregnancy . &quot;
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be applied during pregnancy ( except if required ) and after careful determination of usage for the mother and Risk for the F@@ öt@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible skull is fixed by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be noted prior to the treatment beginning , advice regarding the lock data . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ igns in the breast milk and un@@ wanted effects on the gest@@ ed infant cannot be excluded .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity adverse effects , which were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ ial i@@ om and random@@ ized C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , and were random@@ ized to receive random@@ ized C@@ is@@ plat@@ in as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ enter , randomised , easy @-@ blind phase 3 study of AL@@ IM@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ plat@@ in treated with mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ om that patients had an clin@@ ically significant advantage of a median 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to such patients that were only tied with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving treatment medicine ( randomised and treated ) .
statistically significant improvement of clinical clinical symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in improving the lung functional parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function in time in the control arm .
&quot; multic@@ entr@@ e , randomised , open phase III trial with AL@@ IM@@ TA to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NS@@ CL@@ C in patients with AL@@ IM@@ TA patients ( int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and of 7.9 months were treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of hist@@ ology of hist@@ ology at the overall survival fell to benefit from AL@@ IM@@ TA in patients with NS@@ CL@@ C with a predominantly non @-@ disk epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( n = 172 , 6.2 versus 7.4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0,0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data from a controlled random@@ ized Phase 3 study show that efficacy and progression @-@ free survival compared to patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment is similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ sub@@ sist@@ ence of the AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination with the gem@@ cit@@ abine combination .
PFS was 4.8 months for combination AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in compared to 5.1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 3@@ 3.9 ) for the combination of AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in compared to 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine .
the analysis of the influence of NS@@ CL@@ C hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant sub@@ - according to the hist@@ ology ( see table below ) .

&quot; it is recommended to meet additional gay consider@@ ations , in order to prevent severe diar@@ rhoea possible in the event of severe diar@@ rhoea ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study on inter@@ actions of pharmac@@ euticals , as well as in several cases including the simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of c@@ ic@@ los@@ is was observed . &quot;
&quot; in combination with War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) might be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K , and beta @-@ car@@ otene remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be recommended to take a supplement of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of one @-@ time dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , at a limited number of healthy volunteers , who received the or@@ list@@ at simultaneously , received a margin@@ ally decrease of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;

&quot; the effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal , and hanging with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of frozen fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the cottages are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;

single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were given over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight patients without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of the reported cases reported by Or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ do@@ zation , either side effects or similar effects were reported as at the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on examinations on human and animal , a systematic recovery of certain systemic effects , attributable to the li@@ pas@@ ch properties of or@@ list@@ at , can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect puts in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper intest@@ ine by co@@ valent ashes on the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ kre@@ ised Li@@ pas@@ en .
&quot; clinical studies were derived from clinical studies that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at intake , taken three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the diet is blocked . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BMI of 60 mg / m2 under@@ line the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at that was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ critical , fet@@ al nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of the edge ) , was rated as follows : when changing the body weight of the study ( Table 1 ) , and as proportion of those participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed for 12 months , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the total tim@@ est@@ ess was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value : 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( output value : 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 3.8 % ( output value : 3.@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .
&quot; at the wa@@ ist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting level 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentration of non @-@ met@@ alli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , in case of therapeutic doses not met@@ alli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at could be only spor@@ adic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0,@@ 02 µ@@ mol ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study conducted with adi@@ p@@ ic patients , which was administered minim@@ ally systemic res@@ or@@ ised dose , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after abor@@ tion of the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ Leu@@ cine group ) , were identified among almost 42 % of the total pl@@ as@@ ions . &quot;

&quot; when you take the capsule in connection with a meal that contains too much fat , do not cra@@ ze the nutritional @-@ related accompanying accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to acc@@ use your body to the new eating habits , begin before the first capsule with a cal@@ ori@@ ental and fet@@ al diet . &quot;
&quot; eating habits are effective , as you can fully understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your dietary habits . &quot;
&quot; to ensure your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
do they feed gre@@ y@@ du@@ es to decrease the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood of nutritional @-@ related mer@@ isation ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
&quot; remember to ask your doctor in advance , if you are not used physical activity . • Rem@@ y you during taking and after the termination of taking all@@ i physically active . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i may not be taken for more than 6 months . • If you may not notice any reduction in your weight after twelve weeks of application , please ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in circumstances , you must finish taking all@@ i . • In case of successful weight loss , it is not about to re @-@ end the diet and return to the old habits again . &quot;
&quot; • If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the intake of the capsule . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take one capsule . &quot;
paraly@@ sis with and without deser@@ ted outlet , sudden or multiple chair and so@@ fter chair ) are due to the effect mechanism ( see section 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; severe allergic reactions • severe allergic reactions take you to the following changes : severe breathing , sweat breaks , skin rash , it@@ ching , swelling , it@@ ching , cardiovascular risk . &quot;
&quot; 29 Very common side effects , these can be taken at more than 1 out of 10 people who can take all@@ i . • Bl@@ ank@@ ings ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) with and without deser@@ ted exit • sudden chair • Wei@@ der chair , consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of these side effects are ampli@@ fied or significantly imp@@ aired . &quot;

&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the adverse events have you dis@@ rup@@ ted , or you have any side effects that are not specified in this manual information . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects are related to the activity of the capsules , thereby causing the fat out of the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects occur usually within the first weeks of treatment start , as you may not have to reduce the fat content in the diet at that time . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules you can learn to minim@@ ise the nutritional @-@ related accompanying symptoms : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week before the first taking of capsules with a fet@@ al diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite desserts and over the size of portions you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood that you will exceed your fat limit . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , do not hesitate to have it in the form of a low @-@ fat main dish or a rest@@ rained night@@ fall . • Most people in those accompanying those accompanying you may learn to control them with the time by adjust@@ ing their diet . &quot;
• Compl@@ aint for children un@@ accessible . • You may not apply all@@ i to keep the contents specified on the exp@@ iry date . • Do not keep the container tigh@@ tly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with Si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as so far , can this mean that your body can &apos;t process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; due to compliance with recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize the weight loss and reduce the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood of nutritional @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to gradually decrease . &quot;
&quot; 34 This cal@@ orie intake should allow you to allow you gradually , continuously losing weight of about 0.5 kg per week , without fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you can only burn 150 kcal daily , e.g. through 3 km walk , 30@@ - to 45 minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For a permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set the realistic calcul@@ us and fat targets and keep them too . • makes sense is a nutrition journal with informations about the cal@@ ori@@ - and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies ( such as C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ lock ) .
&quot; the application for patients under 18 years is not recommended , because there are not enough information for the effects in this age group . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are severe or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting .
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , a severe trigger for nausea and vomiting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were treated in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 by 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; with chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were treated in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a comparison with Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . for the management of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of a cancer disease and for prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate @-@ induced chemotherapy because of a canc@@ ers .
&quot; the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vomiting , induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding one before the Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the thick@@ et length , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty ob@@ sc@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute is@@ le@@ us can be monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , caution is necessary for simultaneous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or those tend to be an extension . &quot;
&quot; besides chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi in the days of chemotherapy was not used to prevent nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not prevent tum@@ ors in the five examined chem@@ otherap@@ eutic drug ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ ak , Cy@@ clo@@ ak , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steam @-@ static concentration of the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic interaction . &quot;
&quot; in a population based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( D@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , c@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ oric , and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the cle@@ aring of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experiences about the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies lie not , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women , unless they are considered to be treated as a treat@@ able doctor . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies the most frequently observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams of observed side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least probably stood with Alo@@ xi in connection , heada@@ ches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of sensitivity and reactions in the appointments ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post marketing experiences . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar events were seen from adverse events such as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose @-@ response relationships . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective treatment for a Alo@@ xi@@ - trans@@ do@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 c@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients that received 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) , which was administered to day 1 without N@@ our@@ eth@@ ason intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a randomised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients received a total of 6@@ 67 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and Dac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients that were given to day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of studies with moderately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy is combined in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; following the result of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation of the ion@@ ic channels and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
Res@@ or@@ ption After a intraven@@ ous gift follows a slow elimination of plasma concentration with a slow elimination of the body with an average drop @-@ up time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally propor@@ tionally in the overall dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ@@ g / kg for singing and cancer patients .
&quot; after intraven@@ ously gift by Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average middle ( ± SD ) was measured in 11 calories ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic Sim@@ ulations assumes that at once daily intraven@@ ous gift of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached total exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) compared to one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) compared to one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) compared to one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) compared to one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % eliminated about the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abolic effects that have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
&quot; in vitro studies for metabolism , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 . &quot;
&quot; elimination after a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as the un@@ changed active substance made approximately 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a single @-@ time intraven@@ ous membrane injection , the total body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al Clear@@ ance was 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe liver dys@@ functions are increased the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al life and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , which are regarded as sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure that indicates a small relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of pre @-@ clinical studies revealed that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentration of I@@ onic channels , which can extend to vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation , and can extend the promotional duration . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was taken in approximately the 30 @-@ fold of the therapeutic exposure of humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to a prolifer@@ ation of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ m ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , ag@@ ni@@ er@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the high doses of high doses and Alo@@ xi are given for the only @-@ time application , relevance of these results will be low . &quot;
the holder of these auth@@ orization to bring to the market is necessary to inform the European Commission on the traffic of this decision in the context of this decision .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ ist Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) issued a negative opinion on the approval of the approval of the approval of the treatment of hepatitis C by using Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
this means that Alp@@ he@@ on should be similar to a biological medicines called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same degree that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference cancer &quot; ) .
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ term ) hepatitis C ( one of the viral infection caused by a viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic study the liver tissue causes damage to , and in addition , the values of the liver cir@@ cu@@ it@@ amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood . &quot;
it is produced by yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was added to the formation of the active substance .
&quot; the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on submitted data to prove the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared to the efficacy of the reference ist using 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of treatment on the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressed , that the data on stability of the drug and of the market@@ able drugs were not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which spoke to the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after the treatment with night@@ he@@ on ret@@ ard@@ ant the disease affects more patients than with the reference ist ; in addition , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test was used in the study to investigate how far the medicine is a immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) is not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( one with cruci@@ fer@@ ment of skin infection ) and small in@@ fest@@ ed Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ ves ) , DNA needs and se@@ wed wounds . &quot;
Al@@ clo@@ go is not to be used for the treatment of infections that were det@@ ectable or probably due to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because Alar@@ go is not affected against this type of infection .
&quot; Al@@ clo@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but with patients under 18 years old , the skin surface must not amount to more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
&quot; it affects the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , in which proteins are produced ) , thereby reducing the growth of bacteria . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the efficacy was in all five studies in the proportion of patients , whose infection was after the end of the treatment . &quot;
119 patients ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with placebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected hood , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar contact rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with skin @-@ dogs , 90 % of the patients with both groups spoke to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , it was observed that Al@@ tar@@ go has been caused by treatment of waste ( eit@@ er@@ filled cav@@ ities in body tissue ) or of infection that were demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by M@@ RSA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation on the customer .
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ o@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections against the risks are predomin@@ ant : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • infected little dra@@ in@@ ations , depreciation or se@@ wed wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . approval for the management of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union . &quot;
patients where there are no improvements within two to three days and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in case of sens@@ it@@ isation or severe local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be canc@@ eled , the sal@@ ts carefully caught and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections with which M@@ RSA is known as a path@@ ogen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical studies the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin , St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) , was in@@ sufficient . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered as if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or wor@@ sen@@ ing the infected spot .
the effect of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentration , which were reached in human body after top@@ ical use , an clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ ing is not expected in vi@@ vo ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After simultaneous treatment of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the average Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % due to top@@ ical skin of healthy adult men . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure after top@@ ical use in patients , Dos@@ age adjustments will not be required if top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a Re@@ productive Tox@@ icity after oral intake and are in@@ adequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the killing / post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear , and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the treatment of a systematic antibiot@@ ic antibiot@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in case of decision , whether the breast@@ feeding continued / termin@@ ated or the therapy with al@@ tar@@ go will be continued , is between the benefit of the nursing and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go treatment for women . &quot;
clinical studies on 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections that have applied Al@@ clo@@ go was the most commonly reported side effect on the administration that affects approximately 1 % of the patients .
&quot; round Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ and@@ ro@@ ph@@ ti@@ lin , a substance taken by fermentation from cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly called Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis due to a specific binding point of the 50s @-@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes which differs from the bin@@ dings of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .

&quot; due to the local prevalence of resistance the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear in at least some inf@@ ec@@ tivity forms , an advice should be targeted by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin towards S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin . &quot;
&quot; in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ cid@@ in ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was placed daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion in intact and up@@ side skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were gained . &quot;
the sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adults in front of medication and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the previous application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systematic recording of people after top@@ ical use of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP shirts . &quot;
&quot; metabol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ en , primarily associated with CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies for oral tox@@ icity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;

ambient IS is used to protect hepatitis B and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between a and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; ambient temperature is used as part of a vaccine plan , whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the vaccine can be run into two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is for hepatitis A or B , ambient temperature can be given to another hepatitis B or B vaccine . &quot;
vacc@@ ines may cause vacc@@ ines by bringing the immune system ( the natural resistance of the body ) as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; once a child has received a vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; ambient rix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ult since 1996 , and the Twin@@ rix vaccine since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used for protection against the same illnesses , but Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ult adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered in the scope of one of three doses of existing vaccine . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ult , also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator for effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection of a protective antibodies .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions . &quot;
ambient temperatures resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection of the development of the antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that ambient temperature of ambient from ambient temperature was similar to a 12 @-@ month distance between injec@@ tions .
&quot; the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccination doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , redness , redness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ambient conditions may not be applied to patients who possibly react sensiti@@ vely to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ ica , including approval for the tourist office of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for the pri@@ mer ) is comprised of two vacc@@ ines , with the initial dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a collection is desired for hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines may be vacc@@ inated with appropriate vacc@@ ines or a combination of combination . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ Hepatitis C surface anti@@ gen anti@@ gen anti@@ gen anti@@ gen , anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) , and anti @-@ Hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ static values are in the same size as , according to vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ arian vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; it is not fully assured , whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have addressed to a Hepatitis B vaccine , a refres@@ her vaccination than protection , since it may also be protected by immune memory through the immune memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As for all injec@@ tions , the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction , according to the gift of the vaccine , appropriate opportunities for medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ mp@@ f@@ sch@@ ema is recommended by the combination mechanism which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 mc@@ g. of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disturb@@ ances of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies are reached , so in these cases the gift of additional vacc@@ ines can be required . &quot;
&quot; since intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact success , these injec@@ tions should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , ambient conditions can be in@@ jected using th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or blood cl@@ ots that can occur in these cases according to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift . &quot;
&quot; when ambient temperature was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ it@@ is@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us @-@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - Mum@@ ps R@@ öt@@ t@@ ine vaccine , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive therapy , or in patients with immun@@ o@@ deficiency effects , no sufficient immune response may be achieved . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , was the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mag@@ ist@@ itis , headache , and fever comparable with the frequency that was observed in the earlier Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative vacc@@ inated vaccine formula . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses have been administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 up to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 @-@ 15 years , the compatibility of ambient temperature was compared to the 3 @-@ cans combination . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ability on a calculation base per vaccination program Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation base per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix of 50,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans combination . &quot;
&quot; according to the complete vaccination , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects , the ambient conditions were given , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects , which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ability was comparable high ( i.e. over the total vacc@@ inated cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects , the ambient temperatures were compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects , which received the 3 doses combination ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ability was low and comparable to administration that was observed after administration of the combination process with the 3 @-@ dos@@ ing vaccine .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old stim@@ ulation , the occurr@@ ence of local reactions and general actions in the ambient group was comparable to that with the 3 @-@ cans combination imp@@ aired hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; however , for the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vaccination with ambient temperature a frequent occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection station ) per dose , is not reported in a pro@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported about severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses of vacc@@ ines with ambient conditions with a combination of 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen , was not statistically different . &quot;
clinical studies that were carried out in Imp@@ ul@@ ingen at the age of 1 up to 15 years were the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
&quot; the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , the month 6 recommended dosage ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study carried out in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of ambient temperature and 147 were received with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 people whose immun@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective rate ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose implic@@ it vaccine significantly higher than ambient conditions . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical comparison study in 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds after the termination of the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vaccine received either a 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ sch@@ ema with ambient conditions with a combination of 360 ELISA units with a combination of hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen . &quot;
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with ambient temperature in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ sch@@ ema .
&quot; in this study , immun@@ o@@ gens against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that observed after vaccination of 3 doses , consisting of 360 ELISA units formed with a combination of hepatitis B and 10 mc@@ g. of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen in a dose of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds can be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies are comparable to immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 12 months @-@ vacc@@ sch@@ ema .
&quot; when the first ambient temperature is at the same time the first dose of ambient temperature , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ ps vaccine vaccination ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; a clinical trial , conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults , showed a similar formulation of ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and ser@@ oc@@ onic rates as for earlier formulation . &quot;
the vaccine is both before and after the reset @-@ code per eye certificate on some external particles and / or physical visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis @-@ A virus is usually transmitted through vir@@ us@@ eless food and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as through Baden in wat@@ ered waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms , which may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix is not fully protect infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even when the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus ( even though you / your child may not feel un@@ comfortable or ill / feel good / feel ) an in@@ oc@@ ulation may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms , which are similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , can not be convey@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; if you already have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix , or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
allergic reaction is caused by it@@ ching skin constra@@ ints , breathing , or swelling of face or tongue . if you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis C or Hepatitis B , even if you / your child has a serious infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; if you want to have a protection against Hepatitis B , i.e. within 6 months and prior to the appropriate dos@@ ing of the second vaccine dose . &quot;
&quot; during a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second in@@ oc@@ ulation , the physician will advise you / your child from an vaccination with ambient temperature . &quot;
&quot; instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine per vaccination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a formal hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combined hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
&quot; the second vaccine dose of this vaccine is administered with dimin@@ ished content of effective inventory , usually a month after the first dose , and should give you a vaccination protection before the termination of the vaccine series . &quot;
sometimes ambient temperature is in@@ jected with people who suffer from severe blood co@@ ag@@ ulation suffering from skin and not in muscle tissue . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened out of a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s own defense or if you / your child under@@ wear a hem@@ aly@@ sis .
&quot; ambient may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons can &apos;t be sufficient , so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 S@@ ages your doctor if you take / take another medicine for your child ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without any scri@@ ptions ) , or if you have been vacc@@ inated / Imm@@ ac@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) , or if you have been in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambient conditions , should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as possible . &quot;
&quot; when ambient temperature should be given at the same time or shortly before or after a injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , ambient or lact@@ ating women are not given , except it is urg@@ ently needed that they will be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis B and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has shown a allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; very common ( more than 1 case per 10 sc@@ aled doses ) : • pain or complaints to the sti@@ fle or redness • matur@@ ation • matur@@ ation , heada@@ ches • App@@ et@@ it@@ man@@ gel &quot;
&quot; common ( up to 1 case per 10 different doses ) : • swelling at the injection station • fever ( above 38 ° C ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess • gastro@@ intestinal disorders &quot;
&quot; additional side effects , the days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or individual vacc@@ ines against hepatitis B and hepatitis B are very rarely ( less than 1 case per 10,000 mis@@ cellaneous doses ) are reported : &quot;
&quot; these include bo@@ di@@ ly limited or extensive envel@@ opes , which can be it@@ ching , or pale , swelling of eyel@@ et and facial , we@@ ary breathing , or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and loss of consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like complaints , including shi@@ vers , muscle and joint pain sei@@ zu@@ res , dizziness , fain@@ ting such as t@@ ing@@ ling and &quot; ants &quot; , multiple sclerosis , diseases of the desire or movement of divers , strong headache , and rigi@@ dity of damage , dis@@ ruption to normal brain functions &quot;

&quot; 23 inform@@ s your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if one of those listed side effects you / your child are significantly imp@@ aired or you have any side effects that are not indicated in this package . &quot;
&quot; ambient rix is available in packages of 1 , 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the data , which has become known since the issu@@ ance of the first auth@@ orization to become public , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefits @-@ risk ratio for ambient conditions remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , ambient temperature was only been carried out in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medic@@ inal product is limited because of low @-@ term exposure . &quot;
Ammon@@ aps also can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ consistent en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ium concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ aps is divided - split by several single doses to meals - sho@@ cked , mixed under the food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i ( with the stomach @-@ leading tube ) or a Nas@@ en@@ ix ( through the nose in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to be no compar@@ ative study , ammon@@ aps should not be compared to another treatment or placebo ( an investig@@ ational medicine , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ola also may also lead to appetite loss , an abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid disorders , stomach pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , un@@ comfortable body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
&quot; at the end , the Committee for Human@@ ist Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ aps was effectively prevents ammon@@ ium in patients with disturb@@ ances of the urine cycle . &quot;
ammon@@ i@@ aps has been approved in &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; as due to the rarity of the condition at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine .
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , with which a complete enzyme has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifested form ( in@@ complete enzyme , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first lifestyle ) there is an indication of the use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese consists of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for infants , who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated by taking into account the protein toler@@ ance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults . &quot;
patients who suffer from an early mani@@ f@@ ate deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ thes@@ es or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl is the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ lin or arg@@ inine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an argument in@@ os@@ u@@ c@@ cin@@ ating syn@@ thes@@ es need to receive arg@@ inine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ low disorders , because there is risk for orig@@ ination of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , when the pills won &apos;t reach immediately in the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) , which is equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with contra@@ cep@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney @-@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium recur@@ ring and oil formation . &quot;
&quot; as metabolism is made in the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; for sub@@ cut@@ aneous treatment of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate on young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of ne@@ ural rein@@ forcement and an increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of working nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be detected if phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate divor@@ ced in humans in breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during a breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients had at least one un@@ wanted event ( AE ) , and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not related to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; an likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ abolic cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lact@@ ose pumps , Panz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peri@@ ph@@ erer neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; a case of su@@ do@@ zation occurred at a 5 @-@ month old small child , with an accid@@ ental single dose of 10 grams ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) . &quot;
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate that showed dos@@ ing of dos@@ ing doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active compound designed by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ lic glut@@ amine that is eliminated through the kidneys .
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disturb@@ ances of the urine cycle can be assumed that for each gram sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phenol @-@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen are produced .
it is important that the diagnosis is early and started to improve treatment immediately in order to improve survival and clinical outcome .
&quot; the progn@@ osis of the earliest manifest@@ ation of the disease with the occurr@@ ence of the first symptoms of new@@ bor@@ ns have previously been almost infectious , and the disease himself led to death in treating per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with the nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ ues in the first half of life . &quot;
&quot; by hem@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative way of nitrogen oxide ( sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ace@@ tic ) , protein reduced and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first half of life ) diagnosed in 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and that were treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients the survival occurred with many on mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
patients with a late manifest@@ ing form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ es form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ is a deficiency ) that were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein reduced diet afterwards the survival rate was 98 % .
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of the phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl in sober , and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis after single delivery as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous ing@@ y@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ic acet@@ ate in cancer patients .
&quot; based on a oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablets , 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycles or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was det@@ ectable with a phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate in plasma following different doses of Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day ) . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis which were treated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were treated five times higher than the first day after the first day . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ ert The medication is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ jug@@ ated , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either taken by mouth ( infants and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ ke or a Nas@@ en@@ ix . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ inine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins should be held within the normal range . &quot;
patients who suffer from an early mani@@ f@@ ate deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ thes@@ es or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl is the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ lin or arg@@ inine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , according to 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , equivalent to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if rat economist have been exposed before the birth of Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ic ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyr@@ am@@ ids of brain rin@@ d . &quot;
&quot; an likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ abolic cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lact@@ ose pumps , Panz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peri@@ ph@@ erer neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess . &quot;
based on investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mon@@ amine in patients with disturb@@ ances of the urine cycle can be assumed that for each gram sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phenol @-@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen are produced .
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ in in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this approach includes the small measuring sco@@ op 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring sco@@ op 2.9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op of 8.6 g sodium hal@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient needs to get the medication over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium poly@@ but@@ y@@ at amounts to 5 grams in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare cases , certain liver enzymes missing certain liver enzymes , so that they can not inter@@ fere with the consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if your laboratory studies are performed , you need to tell the doctor that you can take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory testing . &quot;

&quot; during a lact@@ ation period , you are not allowed to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the medicine could go into breast milk and damage your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , headache , taste problems , after@@ math of hearing , disin@@ teg@@ ration , memory problems and a deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you determine one of these symptoms , you immediately get to your doctor immediately or with the emergency up@@ take of your hospital . &quot;

&quot; you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS divided into equal individual doses or via a gast@@ ric ul@@ cer ( hose , which runs through the stomach wall directly into the stomach ) or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde ( hose that will lead through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring sco@@ op . • St@@ range a straight edge , e.g. a measuring line on the edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Take the recommended number of measuring sco@@ op gran@@ ules from the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ men &quot; ( ACS , dimin@@ ished blood supply to the heart ) , for example , un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or E@@ KG ) . &quot;
&quot; if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who under@@ go a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart failure to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the master study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in sole gift or in connection with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination therapy with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; while the PCI was often found a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the Ar@@ ter@@ ie to prevent a cl@@ asp ) , and they also received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or one year as well as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients that under@@ gone a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was equally effective in relation to all indicators as effective as Hep@@ ar@@ ine , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is not to be applied in patients , which may be re@@ ins@@ ens@@ itive to patients ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other elements . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in patients who had a blood flow , as well as people with heavy hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ ist Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for the treatment of ACS and a PCI in a single PCI in case of a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd , a approval for the distribution of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ ms ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lever ) , with an initial intervention , or when an early intervention is provided . &quot;
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI in another consequence a PCI is carried out , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI Express , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be included for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
safety and effectiveness of a single Bol@@ us @-@ gift by An@@ gi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to below 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be performed . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and quickly administered intraven@@ ously to the application dose . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another surveillance is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , a PCI should be subjected to a PCI ( or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is sufficient to test the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to the approval , the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Bol@@ us without dos@@ ages at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) , and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be led 30 minutes after the termin@@ ating treatment of un@@ question@@ ated Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after the completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous treatment of low @-@ molecular Hep@@ arin .
&quot; • known hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active ingredient or other ingredients , or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or higher blood risk disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ ton@@ ic acid and sub@@ acute bacteria damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and with di@@ aly@@ sis patients &quot;
patients are carefully control during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if a PCI @-@ patients appear under the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most blood tests on arter@@ ial Pun@@ ch sites , patients who under@@ go to a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) occur during the treatment in principle everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taken at War@@ far@@ in and are treated with Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) should ensure that the value of the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be reflected in front of the treatment existing level . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies ( Hep@@ arin , war@@ far@@ in , th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tot@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , this active ingredients can increase blood risk . &quot;
&quot; in combination with bi@@ val@@ der@@ ud@@ in combination with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters are in a regular basis . &quot;

&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ or@@ ud@@ in Group as well as in the patients treated with Hep@@ arin , patients and patients over 65 years were more frequent too adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i measurement for heavy bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding even occurred less frequently than in the groups with Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding within the point of pun@@ cture , preventing hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood pressure , re@@ surgery due to a blood flow , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ ales , which occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ ches , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
&quot; the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial involving Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in in 6,000 patients , under@@ go a PCI . &quot;
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ or@@ ud@@ in Group as well as in the patients treated with Hep@@ arin , patients and patients over 65 years were more frequent too adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and heavy bleeding came under the Bi@@ val@@ der@@ ud@@ in significantly less frequently than in the compar@@ ative group under Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects that are not listed above were reported according to comprehensive use in practice , and are arranged according to system organs . in table 6 . &quot;
in case of an over@@ dosage the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is immediately ab@@ rupt and the patient was nar@@ ro@@ red in regards to signs of bleeding .
&quot; angi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ s , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic center as well as at the A@@ ni@@ otic region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , ir@@ respective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is tied in the liquid phase or to Ger@@ inn@@ sel . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ v@@ ud@@ in at Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thereby its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in his part un@@ folded the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , so the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ valent blood @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ ized Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) was induced in the past to he@@ par@@ in@@ ized Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine shows a dose @-@ depend@@ able anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect caused by the pro@@ long@@ ation of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed in the following cases , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ val@@ or@@ is was given and in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study was administered un@@ question@@ ated Hep@@ ar@@ ine or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST ho@@ ists ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) .
patients in arm A and B were also randomised to receive a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the start of angi@@ ography ( at the time of formations ) or in the PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high risk personnel that required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;

clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in were evaluated in patients who under@@ gone a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in as a Pep@@ tide is going through a metabolism in his amino acid components with subsequent re @-@ recovery of the amino acids in the body @-@ pool .
&quot; the primary met@@ abo@@ lit , which results from the split of the Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 bin@@ ation of the N @-@ termin@@ ale sequence through Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , is not effective because of the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
the elimination takes place in patients with normal kidney function after a process first order of 25 ± 12 minutes .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity , repeated treatment , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity or reproductive @-@ tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data can be seen no particular dangers for human beings . &quot;
tox@@ icity in animals at repeated or contin@@ ual exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks in a exposure to 10 @-@ fold in clinical @-@ state plasma concentration ) was confin@@ ed to excessive pharmac@@ ological effects .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treating adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes , who require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , in@@ jected or upper arm , or is administered as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
&quot; diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin for the regulation of glucose ( sugar ) in the blood , or does insulin can not work effectively . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ular l@@ ul@@ ism differs very margin@@ ally of human@@ insulin , and the change means that it has faster and a shorter activity period as a short @-@ effective Human@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in use in combination with a low @-@ effective insulin treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and enrolled in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; type 2 diabetes , where the body of insulin does not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator for effectiveness was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ cer@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is stopped .
&quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0,@@ 14 % ( of 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in six months compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % for insulin delivery . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in human corne@@ as .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied in patients , which may not be sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ ism or any of the other ingredients , or with patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines , which can affect the glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Deutschland GmbH for the management of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the range of abdominal wall or delta muscle using continuous in@@ fusion in the range of abdominal injury .
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and dimin@@ ished insulin delivery , the insulin requirement can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the effectiveness , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin delivery ( normal , N@@ PH , is delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can withdraw a change of the insulin requirement . &quot;
&quot; 3 A in@@ sufficient dosage or termination of a treatment , especially in patients with a insulin @-@ proof diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ; these conditions are potentially li@@ fel@@ ong . &quot;
the change@@ over of a patient on another insulin type or insulin is required under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required .
&quot; at the time of occurr@@ ence of a hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , insulin depends on the profile of the insulin delivery and can therefore change in changing the treatment schem@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ dem@@ ics include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Conver@@ ting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , fi@@ br@@ ine , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ yl@@ gly@@ cine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phs , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;

&quot; severe Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ dem@@ ics with consciousness of consciousness can be treated with in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ cop@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an appropri@@ ated person or administered by a physician to glucose by a physician . &quot;
&quot; after a glu@@ co@@ ag@@ projection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
&quot; insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the peripher@@ al glucose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) , and through the in@@ hibition of glucose in the liver . &quot;
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin resistance occurs faster and the effect duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes , insulin showed insulin injec@@ tions in the therapeutic range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg to a proportional position of glu@@ ing effect , precisely as human@@ izes . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ cer@@ in has a double so rapid effectiveness of action like normal human@@ kind , and is achieved for about 2 hours earlier as human insulin . &quot;
&quot; data from the data was apparent that during an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ ism in 2 minutes before the meal is achieved a comparable post@@ den@@ ial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control , as is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; the insulin delivery was taken in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ den@@ sely control was achieved than with human corne@@ a , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; taking insulin delivery in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , there is a compar@@ ative gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control like a human normal insulin that is given 2 million gro@@ oves before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin delivery in gift for 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - before the beginning of the meal was given before the beginning of the meal , 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal was given at 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 minutes before the meal was given before a meal ( Figure 1B ) . &quot;
&quot; after the start of the meal in 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human@@ kind of insulin , the 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) was given before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1 ) . &quot;
