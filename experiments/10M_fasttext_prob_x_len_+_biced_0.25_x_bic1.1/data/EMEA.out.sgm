<seg id="6">"for the treatment of severe to severe episodes, Abilify is used to treat severe episodes in patients who have addressed to the medicine in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioral disorders when the oral ingestion of medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both cases, the solution can be applied to one or the melting tablets in patients, which have used the swallowing of tablets difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"patients who are also taken to use other medicines at the same time, should be the same as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the signal transmission between brain cells are impaired by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is probably mainly as a "partial agglomerate" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol looks like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but rather than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"da dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin at schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are playing a role, bears Aripiprazole to normalize the activity of brain, which prevents psychotic or manic symptoms and will be prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify that will halt the symptoms, was investigated in three trials up to a year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of injection solution has been compared to two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia, or similar illnesses, compared to a period of two hours with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol in another study to prevent the efficacy of Abilify and placebo which have been stabilized to 160 patients where the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder associated with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scope for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in addition, the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the processed tablets and the solution to income (up)."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received significantly stronger reduction in symptoms and patients who received placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in use for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify diminished in four of the five short-term studies of certain symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"moreover, in addition to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented the reappear of certain episodes in previously treated patients and if it was given to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in 10- or 15-mg doses, Abilify injections reduced significantly more effective than placebo as placebo and were similarly effective as Lorazepam."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common adverse events of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidical disorders (uncontrolled), headache, blurred vision (increased saliation), stress-hypersecretion (increased saliation), stress-hypersecretion (increased saliation), fatigue and exhaustion, sleep disorders, insomnia (insomnia) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Humanist Affairs (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and severe to severe episodes in bipolar disorder, and with the prevention of a new manic episode in patients, which were mainly manic episodes on treatment with Arial prazole, facing the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the result that the advantages of the injection solution for rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioral disorders in patients suffering from bipolar disorder in bipolar disorder, if a oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted the Company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the management of Abilify throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is responsible for the treatment of moderate or heavy episodes of the bipolar I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day irrespective of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily; independent of meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered, if clinical factors should justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychological illness and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases according to the beginning or by change of an antipsychotic therapy (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemic of epidemiological study showed that there was no increase in patients with bipolar disorder with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, heart failure disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, cerebral diseases, cerebrovascular diseases (including acute and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyskinesia: in clinical studies that lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports on the treatment with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if patients appear at an ABILIFY, symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinists should be drawn to decrease the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or has a clear fever without having an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all anti-psychotic medicines will have to be aborted by ABILIFY."</seg>

<seg id="43">"however, there were in one of these studies, a study involving fixer dosing, a significant relationship between the dosage and response to unwanted cerebrovascular events with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoaziarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic active ingredients including ABILIFY."</seg>

<seg id="47">"a weight gain is generally used in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar Mania based on composorbidities, the application of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, and could lead to severe complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is required if Aripiprazol can be taken in combination with alcohol or other central-effective medicines such as seals (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-Antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, with this effect as clinically irrelevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study of healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected to expect other high-level inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore, similar dosing reductions."</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolizing may result in higher plasma concentration of CYP3A4 to higher plasma concentration of CYP3A4 (compared to CYP2D6).</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should survive potential risks for patients."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be increased to the dosing as before the start of the accompanying treatment."</seg>
<seg id="56">"diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6, together with ABILIFY, can be administered with a moderate increase of Aripiprazol- concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="57">Clinical studies showed doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol per day no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methodxymorphine) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if pregnant or are pregnant during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to insufficient data security for security during the human being and due to the reproductive studies in the animal, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit is justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"as with other antipsychotic medicines, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, to operate until they are safe that Aripiprazol has no negative influence on it."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>

<seg id="72">Clinical trials and since the market launch have been observed unintentional or intentional survivors with Aripiprazol alone in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there are no information on the effectiveness of a hemalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely that hemalysis in the treatment of an overdose of benefits is, since Aripiprazol has a high plasma connection."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is communicated to the combination of a partial-agonistic effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptor and a antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to the Dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and the serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor, as well as an affinity to the Dopamine D4-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1 adrenches and to the histamine receptors."</seg>
<seg id="76">"with the gift of Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers, the Positahs emissions-tomography showed a dosisdependency reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands at Nucleus caudus and on the cleaning."</seg>

<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder showed a placebo superior to placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 weeks with fixer's patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two Placeboarding and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with one manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazol showed an effect on placebo over a week 3 and a lasting effect that was comparable to the rate of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the manie to such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partly over 2 weeks did not reflect on lithium or valine-monotherapy in reducing environmental symptoms compared to Monotherapy with lithium or valproate."</seg>

<seg id="2968">"insular lulism differs very marginally of humaninsulin, and the change means that it has faster and a shorter activity period as a short-effective Humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was used in use in combination with a low-effective insulin treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and enrolled in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"type 2 diabetes, where the body of insulin does not work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for effectiveness was the change of the concentration of the substance glycerylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0,14% (of 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in six months compared to a decrease of 0.14% for insulin delivery."</seg>
