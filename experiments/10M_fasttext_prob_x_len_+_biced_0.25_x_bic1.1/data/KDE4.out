&quot; the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy some of the features of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by adding this easier . &quot;
for further information on the use of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions you will find in the manual &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select Settings ... Read and select the card controller , and select the modules desired . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of standard setup modules from the K@@ DE package ; add ad@@ don . please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system , if you have additional software installed . &quot;
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; before you compiled this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click on the Con@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras : you can view the page , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for crash , or the list of crash@@ es , if present , del@@ eting . &quot;
the module filter ( also called folder filters ) can be reached in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras tags . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; the directory directory contains different kind of filters .
&quot; to view the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document , example : element element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root canal . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; a further view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be considered as an alternative for the different tool@@ bar and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in it that depic@@ t folder hier@@ arch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is represented by a rectangle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the size of the sub@@ ordin@@ ated objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , the size of a folder as the sum of the size of entries is specified . according to this way , big files can be easily detected , even if it can be seen below in the folder hier@@ archy . according to this way , it can be considered as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you can be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , a record in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rectangle which represents a file or folder in your file system . easy navigation have the right corner of reasonable color and labelling . &quot;
&quot; the colour of a rectangle which is switched over color mode , can be either depth for the easy detection of the cat@@ ar@@ box or picture of another file system such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each capacity , you can define whether they are displayed at all , only if enough space is to be present or if there is enough space to be displayed in the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap . moreover , you can define the relative position of labelling in the rectangle . &quot;
&quot; for events algorith@@ ms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should normally be observed that the area is proportional to size of the entry . at Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target will not always be able to display the cas@@ ings of entries , and these frames are no longer available , if the rectangle is square , if the rectangle is square . &quot;
&quot; as divi@@ ding the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ates entries , the implementation has been left . here , it is necessary for the labelling and to prevent plac@@ ental losses due to increasingly beneficial the areas that are square . the best methods of this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive second healing . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minimal area for an entry above the menu entry . instead , a trunk pattern is drawn into the area of the higher entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ated entry . &quot;
&quot; originally it was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application , and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ get , which was designed for use K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ rin@@ d . &quot;

&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; to participate , registration in the developers &apos; mailing list . instruction to sign in the developer mailing list of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to set your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote file . simply enter the folder symbol folder to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you have to specify a local folder on your computer . this path will be stored for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add a lot of folders such as you would like to add . &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; will also be used as a library . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the images as base folders . &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; consider every sub @-@ folder as a album . no image will be changed . during the passing of the folder , you get a progress indicator as these can be seen : &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; dur@@ ations recur@@ sively the library path in its entire depth . you can &apos;t lock any sub @-@ folder as it is a box in hidden folder . this allows you to insert an extra@@ pol@@ ation &amp; dict@@ ator ; do you complete a point before the name of the sub@@ ord@@ ner .
&quot; if you have a existing folder with photos as basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list does not have photos as symbols . you can change the albums by clicking on the folder symbol . this will then be used as an alb@@ um@@ symbol . more details can be found in the folder albums . &quot;
&quot; once you configured the base file , you can set up in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you should use your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to manage my records and my print box to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw file support : in case you use the raw mode of your camera , so you can handle it ; maybe you may want to circum@@ vent if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ assist . &quot;
how to setup this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h @-@ Work@@ flow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided , so that you can connect with your digital camera and supports your photos directly in &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; -@@ albums can be supported by library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system , will work together with &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by using Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera can be used as a USB mass storage device . the camera can also be used as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be used as a record transfer protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for digital cameras supporting digital cameras , which supports a constantly increasing number of more than 800 cameras supporting digital cameras , a widely used protocol that supported by the International Imag@@ ing Industry Association . it allows for transfer@@ ring images of digital cameras to host host@@ els and other peripher@@ als without the need additional driver . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos in general are big files and transfers about the serial port are slow , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; dict@@ ator@@ i ; supports these cameras and performs a complete list of supported cameras at this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so the EX@@ IF support is required to read the images of di@@ gi@@ K@@ am . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo 2 , you may possibly can see any images or the production could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ Interface Project ( Manual ) is a approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and g@@ wen@@ view . aim is to provide modules for all graphics programmes . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can be a user . your advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; through writing of a small module to complement one function , as the changes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; to perform . &quot;
&quot; to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either switch the si@@ deb@@ s with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to the full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; pull and off from pictures works everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the aluminum section , above the horizontal separ@@ ator line or another use window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be found in keywords , file list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to extract the more common : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . so , the filters are displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ames only if this ind he tool@@ bar . what fields are displayed in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; is a organized view on your photo albums . all photos that were stored by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; these albums can be stored on the hard drive , by the name of their collection in the old properties or after the date that the album may be changed . the date can be changed in the properties tab . &quot;

this rider provides an intuitive detection tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to move into a square . press the images within this coordinates are filtered and indicated . this includes all images of ge@@ o @-@ data .
&quot; in the bottom below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window to compare with which you can easily compare pictures . he works with all supported image data formats , including raw files . &quot;
&quot; choose one or more pictures from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L for the illumin@@ table to add out of the context menu and open its window . if you are back in &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; main window , you can quickly open the lumin@@ aire quickly with L ex@@ tras . &quot;
&quot; from the front bar you can compare the pictures you want to compare , in the left or right range of the window , select the zoo and / or shift operations on one of the pictures , then you will compare the same range of the two pictures . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to print fast from a picture series . if you navigate the pair mode , the two first pictures are automatically displayed in the sections on any image to display it in the right hand side . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , normal loos@@ ening work also works directly from the lumin@@ aire , such as F4 file ... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the main page bar of the main focus are available for both pre@@ fers in the illumin@@ ant . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end of each area , you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ v@@ elling feature that you can see on the cross @-@ crossed posts . to hold the visible range of the image , you must click on this image below . in the mode look at the same image will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom range under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse in the picture in and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode preview .
&quot; what is a digital data management system - away from the fashion word ? digital data management considers each part of the process which follows the picture , sc@@ anned or digital photos , but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient manner . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , find a plan and practical tips how to back up your pictures , find , protect and use photos again . we look at the process for digital photographs that you can use , convert , convert , backup , backup , backup , wait , wait , and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management receives , indicated , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , conf@@ ection@@ ed , conf@@ ection@@ ed , conf@@ ection@@ ed and exports content that have a mon@@ et@@ ype or cultural value . quot ; &quot;
&quot; met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data about data . met@@ ad@@ ata is defined according to your definition , information about or documentation of other data which will be administered by an application or environment . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have to find a certain photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have to store in a database as well as in the image files to save very fast searching and a secure archi@@ ving to you with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you need to keep in your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . you need to decide whether other access to your photos are supposed to be able to store them on a network drive , etc . make sure you need to switch to a larger drive . &quot;
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . tourist images can be found quickly about your location . if you are able to organize your data in one year . if you are able to make enough photos then you &apos;ll print sub @-@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . you can then publish a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of images on different subjects and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will not want to organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what type of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking processing easier . split new from old files .
the separation of original and labour files simplified a securing strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option stored in the creation page of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; it ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written in the file , then you can later select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into files by clicking the corresponding point in the menu album . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? for this purpose , &amp; dict@@ ates ; them a met@@ ad@@ ata Editor for a number of selected attributes . these are the most important . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should select every photo keywords , labelling and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that you can choose the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense because you can now concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s now proceed with keyword , keyword , how to proceed with other programs , or proceed to categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import catalog@@ u@@ ed pictures from another source with embedded topics , then you will add the images to the right spot . the change of the hier@@ archy within the tree is not a problem , and can easily be done through the pull of a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are pursued by &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; updated while the lower trees are pursued . &quot;
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over@@ cut . this is a very rough representation because each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all pictures .
enough of keywords - the next section refers to lab@@ eling or comments using the third important tool to licate your met@@ ad@@ ata .
&quot; you want to let most ni@@ em@@ anden your photos just look , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your pictures . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , you start seeing some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this the landing field of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . Wow ! you can start dre@@ aming , associations , the historical period is again present , you may perhaps even hear the silence . so your perception has changed this panorama as completely . &quot;
&quot; for others looking at your photo , the title is possibly more important than the image itself to create a story . if you have pictures , you should tell a story . if you have pictures , you should tell a story to help Him to help Him to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is OK when a picture is not perfect if the strength has only one lab@@ eling to work alone .
&quot; with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; you can also save a lot of text in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . you can even put it to a selection of images at the same time . so you can even tell your pictures into web galleries and so you have to tell us a second time for the opening of the image . &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find out a different city without navigation system ? was it not a bo@@ red planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train de@@ parts the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities of explo@@ iting the ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already unbe@@ atable in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys via pictures with geographical data . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . you can also export the pictures to Goo@@ gle@@ .com viewer . &quot;
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and signi@@ fies the practice of using copyright to remove restrictions concerning the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also applicable in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
&quot; the following description tells you which information in the alignment page of &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived , should be paid as information : &quot;
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for narr@@ ator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has been created . if it is not desired to protect the name of photographers , then the name of a company or organization can &apos;t be changed . this field does not support sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; author itel ( syn@@ onym for the editor ) : linked with the author . examples can be the title of the photographer . examples of this can be as : employee photographer , free professional photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a ver@@ itable photographer , this must be completed as well . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( Syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the An@@ bi@@ dder field to identify anyone who works . if the photographer has been listed for a news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the image is a warehouse , then the group / Agency will see the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against abuse . everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can only delete it . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique in the picture . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; will provide such a module for the st@@ acking processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : turn@@ out error , turn@@ out failure , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disin@@ ter@@ ity , time , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ ition &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs recorded on the road or a fire . this type of losses are the same which can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatives . in this section , there are problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; cro@@ ll On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which has a data loss . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , this c@@ auti@@ ous vision must be treated for longer than a few years . of course , you can also get CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer to get more difficult and considerably more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 that is a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe that is in your mess@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good dis@@ ks and good recording devices and they can do much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . it turns therefore to the right choice . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to error , even if you were just written . therefore , use a control mechanism mechanism to protect themselves . despite this massive protection , they are needed by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster , which apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs , but is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that are damaged by damaged flo@@ ppy disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drive etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to be able to win the format of HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB , and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything that has been said to CDs and DVDs is also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; slowly burn the data back with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . read the media with a description , date &amp; author label and afterwards on a clean , dark dry and in front of animals protected areas . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ cos retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers include a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a great field study about the error mechanisms of hard disks : dis@@ miss@@ ars &quot;
&quot; shortly : Dis@@ ks keep the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperature , the most common error message , SM@@ ART can not notice this error . some of SM@@ ART can not notice the immediate imp@@ lications . this is the expected life @-@ time interval between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; here , it is only about the complete loss of losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also use data loss due to a power loss before reaching the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without large problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric appliances do not comprise a lot of power , that can cause devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause severe damage , hardware fail@@ ures , complete data loss , hardware damage , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable which leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
the most common protection against electricity tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is part of energy heat absorbed and the rest is gro@@ unded . however , it is usually in the form of a plug @-@ bar . however , remember that not every plug @-@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it protects against lighten@@ ing and protect the correct devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that even all peripher@@ als that are connected to your system is also protected . some manufacturers make over@@ voltage cables as well as a phone connector for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV ticket . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially developed for not@@ ebooks , and you also contain the protection for your modem . so you are ideal for on the go . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really assist you with a complete failure . even a few seconds can lead to loss of int@@ oler@@ able data . it can therefore be useful in a interrup@@ tible power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protection against over@@ vol@@ t@@ ages , these tools can automatically provide battery energy when a power out@@ age is entering . some models can even be able to save up to the system . if you purchase a US@@ V , you should be sure that they get the same quality requirements as a over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the battery life of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; write your safety at the potential risk to avoid your computer system and compare it to the cost of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage safety can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 euros , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be protected for less than &amp; Euro ; 40 . at the end , you should always think all the cables before you ride into holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offering you can save any data . &quot;
&quot; compared to the hard drives , however , you are very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data on compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suited to a local data loss of most important pictures . it &apos;s not a bad solution , but it is not a general safety solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services which are stored on photos . your free memory is not limited to photos . the professional variant will have more information available , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you will get unlimited memory , which should be reviewed in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data security , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted in accordance with the TCP protocol and provide a backup and a divi@@ ding memory . therefore , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ably . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs have at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing about it is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these disturb@@ ances remain un@@ discovered until you have thought of one day to do this . no one seems to have any protection for it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably secure data way than that in your computer . &quot;
un@@ reliable grid parts are another source of transmission loss because they generate inter@@ e@@ fer@@ encing within data streams . in normal fil@@ esystem all mistakes remain un@@ noticed .
&quot; even if you are currently not concerned about transmission problems , you should see in the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates to handle a low level and is highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha @-@ status . it is still used in alpha @-@ status . it is also used for &amp; Linux ; but it &apos;s not part of the kernel .
&quot; not under@@ estimate that ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the losses in not@@ ebook , and 46 % for job systems . in not@@ ebooks the proportion of theft is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new install@@ ments . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems , but Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer have been sigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of investig@@ ational inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file was not completely stored before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
digital cameras sensors are 1 @-@ 2 pre@@ ference settings of fundamental physical limits . it is meant that the technology continues to develop further . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of the 10 meg@@ api@@ xels . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deterior@@ ated for compact cameras and high @-@ quality op@@ tics . even DS@@ LR cameras do need your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xels . for higher resolutions require a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; today , you get a 750@@ GB hard drive to get responsible for data loss . therefore , you don &apos;t need anyone affected by any data loss . therefore , you can also use your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do something dangerous like the re@@ installing your operating system , exchange plates or the size of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you if the drive was not connected in the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster suggests local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget plane crashed : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ ak always means a not local store . bring your f@@ ences up the steps up , into the neighbouring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above , is a common reason for a loss of data back to backup the panic . if you have a backup , which is not immediately available , then you can save one day . &quot;
&quot; complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be saved . this is a snap@@ shot without history , and represents a complete copy at a time . &quot;
&quot; differentiation : a backup of files have been changed since the last complete backup . this creates a complete snap@@ shot at two points : the complete backup and the previous differential . &quot;
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time again , which comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that it has just been touched and not continuously . &quot;
sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily be able to set up on your machine . in contrast to script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer script errors r@@ sync only the difference of files that really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase safety about ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media .
&quot; this approach makes you enough time to discover and restore loss . at the same time , you come back for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work files . at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment should be done manually , after which you have done a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , Keep original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; thus , valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because you remember your childhood or adolesc@@ ence , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predic@@ table due to nature , you have to look with caution and re @-@ evaluate during the time . unfortunately , there is no other way to be backward when the current system is backward . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered on the basis of explanations in this document . use or change open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is now available for any . if you have an old system , it is important to read your pictures , then store it on and install it in a virtual machine for a later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay in open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is to change a system in size for the possibility of changing a system in its size . this actually means always enlarge .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and put the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and leave it on a new record :
&quot; check the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new plate was recognized by the system , but do not hang them . &quot;
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; par@@ ted re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; US $ / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if needed
open Source Standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is able to read it then you can create this yourself . this task is easier by year to year easier .
GIF is a proprietary and patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . so you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore .
P@@ NG was developed as an open source standard to replace GIF . but it can save much more . it is loss @-@ free supported by X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can recommend that there is relative many administration information , but not as many as T@@ IFF requires and a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend you to store your pictures . &quot;
&quot; T@@ IFF was widely used as picture format . T@@ IFF is able to store in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a low @-@ loss compression agent ( De@@ fl@@ ate ) . however , it is managed to store images in this format . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
&quot; D@@ NG The Digital Negative file format is a free and open raw image format , designed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the need for the need for camera data formats . it is already available on the T@@ IFF / EP format , and we hope to use the Canon and Nikon . &quot;
&quot; this may possibly be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace &amp; quot ; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored in an extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to view a original of your recording , mostly in the rough format , as it stores the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file and how it can be viewed from the image file and how above is mentioned , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as container and place everything there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that assi@@ sts in fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , supporting a large field of application and modelling , discussions and collabor@@ ative efforts to reach the D@@ CM@@ I @-@ communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work groups , annual conferences and educational efforts to reach an extensive acceptance of met@@ ad@@ at@@ ons and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the reader or the scanner . this is how long the pictures are on the camera , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your shell archive . this function is not implemented yet .
&quot; for fine processing , you can use external programs . if you return the pictures again with &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; edit , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut under circumstances by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it to MPEG , use in m@@ peg , please print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; in the section add some photos to an album , you can add a description of how you can already have your disk . however , the camera interface offers you a lot more advanced settings to import@@ ing images to your alb@@ end@@ point . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; to use , connect these with the machine , turn the camera onto the display mode and turn on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . in some cameras , it may take a while . if this is the case , the file names will appear at the bottom end and the umb@@ nails at the bottom . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the file association for each file , photos , movies , music , etc . &quot;
&quot; before you can download photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information on each entry . with the side@@ car properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an updated and met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
this dialog displays file characteristics and the photo information that are intern@@ ally saved by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded on your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all information available .
&quot; the tab met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , Manufac@@ turers , GPS , etc. of the picture . this information is the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; dict@@ ator@@ i ; or image processing . note that this met@@ ad@@ ata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; you will not delete photos from their camera into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the link you want to download the default settings , select the button to download and then select the button . the button selected can be selected as long as you select some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available until now . these pictures have not yet been downloaded from &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; here . in this case , the new pictures are selected with a star in the front window . if you select this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you are downloading the buttons all or selected files , a dialogue with which you can select the target album , displayed as normal folders , click here . details of the existing albums can be read in the section My Albums . select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after having selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; dict@@ ator@@ i ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete any delete the button . if you want to delete a few , then you must select it first and delete the delete chosen . &quot;
&quot; note that there is no possibility to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . so , you should not want to delete the photos successfully into an &amp; di@@ gi@@ vest ; they should be careful if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , this will be much faster . &quot;
cameras are often used as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally re@@ generated after the photos taken from the camera . this can be recommended to double fil@@ en@@ ame in the same album . therefore it can be useful to integrate photos of different recording criteria into the same album . this can be useful in the file names .
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and sk@@ e@@ wers of the picture and for data bases . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; the options during the transmission opens three additional options , which are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF information is copied into the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to use another file format as the standard format , you can use the Pre@@ fix Photo - % Y@@ - % d % H : % S . for further adjustments , you should read the command time reading time . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the camera file name , you have the possibility to change the file names in lower case letters . or in case letters if you prefer . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; dict@@ ator@@ i ; used for a photo , will be displayed below the name , displayed the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming is stored and automatically used when you open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; can take all information about the orientation of the camera to record the time . not all cameras put this information ready . in the page side@@ bar Metad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information you see your camera into the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera do not supplies this information , you can switch the button in the original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic turn , use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotation of the window of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera has done information on the date on which the photo was made available , you can use &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore . this under@@ above are based on the image data . all images with the same date are uploaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are able to read this information . in the page side@@ bar met@@ a data you can read what information your camera can be embedded in the photos . &quot;
this option is normally switched off and in this case it stores &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option . use the button Extended and select the button @-@ based bases at the bottom end of the window .
the easiest way to download photos from their computer on their camera is the button to download . you can then select the file extension dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; you can also select the file extensions . you can also select more than one file with the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
&quot; after the picture selection is done , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; you , where the images should be uploaded . select the desired file and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the pictures are not deleted by your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general concept in this document , which is indicated in the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude that can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an aircraft to carto@@ graph@@ ically . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the photo , where exactly the photo was done , you can open a browser which shows the area . if you want to select a postcard to another &amp; dict@@ ator ; users want to identify the site or simply document this aspect , it is good to access the position data of a picture . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map refer@@ encing . so the question is actually more than the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a reproduction of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic assignment ( manual ) and last about manual input from known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera which has a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receiver . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done using g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , this data is required in the GP@@ X format because this is the only format supported by the module for ge@@ ographic mapping . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract the data of images and from GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude or other data , then you can use this script which works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the number of characters created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European street species . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , all the navigation details in Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; try to give you much control over its work processes as possible . there are many settings that access the behaviour of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; to set up in the Settings menu , set up in eight pages . you can change between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
you can select action to show in embedded preview or editing the image editing . so you place the default behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; determine if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the current candidate and copyright data . this data is automatically written in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is written during the download from the camera interface . this data is also written in the IP@@ TC field . &quot;
&quot; Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for the editor : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . these can be as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description for the author , this also needs to be filled . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to indicate the photo . this must not be the author since Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press should be listed here . if the picture is a warehouse , then the group or agency should be available here . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC rock . thereby , the met@@ ad@@ ata is permanent in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; this met@@ ad@@ ata is also available and can be imported into &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; they are imported without losing . &quot;
&quot; image labeled as embedded c@@ abling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this is synchron@@ ized the comments that you can add to your photos , which appear to images in images , which are already written by other pictures , these are written by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; over@@ run by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all options for the information appearing , if the mouse poin@@ ter in the main window on a file rests . according to selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; # 160 ; di@@ gi@@ ate ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which data types &amp; dict@@ ator@@ i came ; indicate , you can add the file extension to this list and remove any file extensions , which has no such enh@@ ancements , by &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; the default settings can be reset , by clicking the button Update to the right of each category . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; dict@@ ator@@ i ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , you can only get on fast computers . if you have one , then you can receive a better memory results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing is using a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer another color , you can switch it here . you can switch the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and sub@@ str@@ ated areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brigh@@ ter colour in the picture . these colors are set here . in picture editing you can arrive and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are encoded within a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the immediate declaration . &quot;
&quot; using P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since P@@ NG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can adjust this value to a high compression . thereby , 1 : low and 9 requires a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the T@@ IFF @-@ files option , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate sal@@ es@@ m for T@@ IFF pictures . this reduces the size of the T@@ IFF pictures . it has no influence on image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm has no loss . &quot;
&quot; with the los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you were written the loss of loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but remained in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe , the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it has been developing very quickly to a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the standard definition is that all the green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option for sensitive to ultra@@ violet light , this difference does a little soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option stands for a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 wi@@ red pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white @-@ weight of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used only if the white is not set . standard is a fixed colour balance , which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . using the second sensors , the effect of the second sensors get more details in the val@@ lich@@ ens . for other cameras , this option will be ignored . &quot;
&quot; the standard is the Spitz@@ lich@@ ter , so the parts of your pictures are burned @-@ in , because of the in@@ ability of your camera showing the bright white results . in addition , the setting colors will solve some extravag@@ ant results , since they are trying to recon@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the Spitz@@ lich@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the lack of green and red shares from the still not satisfied blue pixel . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; select the option re@@ construc@@ ts , you get the possibility to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; put the lumin@@ ance to your taste . however , you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; to keep the time for the demo method small , you should follow con@@ serv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a demo algorithm is a digital picture process to calculate a complete picture from the sub @-@ filtered image sensor , which have many cameras and which are a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as a CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour structure . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ d@@ came ; and D@@ cra@@ w put three alternatives to you : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . according to some tests it was created as if A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting , if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable results . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with the color devi@@ ation of your lenti@@ ls , you can put the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a d@@ ash correction , as it is carried out during the rough conversion . &quot;
&quot; a profile transl@@ ates the color information and commands instructions like this should be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; information like the color space from a colour space in the other , the colors are as accurate as possible . &quot;
behavior Questions when a picture is opened in picture editing / color management module with resource files .
color profile folder S@@ ing here the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / color / user / user / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you all store your profiles . &amp; dict@@ ator@@ i ; exam@@ ines this folder during the start . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be opened at opening the shell file later .
the colour@@ ing view is an alternative towards X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here only your pictures are not managed by the entire screen .
&quot; input profiles should be fit to the camera control and model you use . not all profiles are generated on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have color mapping or gamma radiation . this means that you do not have to perform the tone mapping themselves . &quot;
&quot; there are further options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate , as your image of a device would be given again . this is very useful before you can print a smaller colour range as your camera and some colors are therefore very sati@@ ated , instead of leaving the blind algorithm your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious that the colour profile is for them for what is intended for . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that can fit together . this answer is naturally in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension allows for the purpose of recogni@@ zing the style : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plug@@ in Interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; K@@ DE ; image inspec@@ tions and image processing . many modules have been written to work together with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see a list of available modules . select the select which you want to use , and these modules will then be downloaded from &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; these modules appear as new entries in the menu window and beyond . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks which are carried out by modules , set up in the menu under Settings short commands . &quot;
&quot; for more information ( in English ) on K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org , or in the text@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the higher controller adjustment the time between the pictures , usually there are 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other check boxes do turn off the met@@ ad@@ ata , or which appears at the bottom end of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show a list of all for the time supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Automatic recognition , which is connected to a camera that is connected to the computer . these are currently serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera box . you have to enter the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / h , indicate your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; to use , you have to connect the camera to your computer , put them in the display mode and turn off . &quot;
&quot; try out if &amp; di@@ gi@@ plug ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es ; if not , you can reset camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than a camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option acknowle@@ d@@ gement dialog for the shift of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash can display , you can set the conversation of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; for del@@ eting a photos in an album , find out more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be dis@@ cur@@ ated by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; to use , if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without feedback . otherwise , you have to apply the changes with the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also prevent the display of a welcoming computer of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; under the beginning , it acceler@@ ates the starting process from &amp; dict@@ ator@@ i . &quot;
&quot; when you want to start new photos , you are looking for new photos . this extends the starting time of &amp; dict@@ ment albums / photos . this extends the starting time of &amp; dict@@ ment . if something from the base file was deleted , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; you , if it should delete it from the base file . &quot;
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . this settings can be selected under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs is listed below :

the picture editing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; therefore you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the illustrated section .
&quot; status bar at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ame , enlargement factor and the actual picture size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool bar for fast access to the most commonly used functions . &quot;
editing functions of image editing will change your photos . however , the original photo will change the original photo before you can save or use the button save from the tool bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo as soon as you have stored the image . &quot;
so you might need to make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save with file Save as .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using or use the button Rest@@ ore editing in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose every change you have done at the photo since the last store . &quot;
almost every action of image processing can be revers@@ ed respectively re@@ produced or re@@ produced . the last action can be revers@@ ed by choosing editing and re@@ produce re@@ produce from the menu .
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z for revers@@ ing and make C@@ tr@@ l ; Um@@ bre@@ alt @-@ Z to re @-@ establish . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer the &amp; L@@ MB , select a moment more than the back @-@ scale or restore button in tool@@ bar for a moment , you will get a cont@@ text menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are re@@ arranged and re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; once you have launched the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword , by clicking the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture down or the entries in the menu file , you are asked whether you want to save them . &quot;
you can start in the photo and zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the ste@@ e menu .
&quot; to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool bar : upgrade factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view , where you can &apos;t want to use the Es@@ c button . if you don &apos;t want this , you can open it from the &amp; dict@@ ment ; main window . please see the section to set the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can print image printing in the menu and get the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; print dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets . whole picture shows can be printed from your selection . you need only select the pictures with the standard methods and follow the wi@@ z@@ ard menu , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which is important information and promotions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation devices , even if one of the five riders will be cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again in the edge .
&quot; in the labelling view , you can insert signs with unlimited size or insert . note that the text is allowed to UTF @-@ 8 . that means that all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - field , so that you can use other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are formed after 2000 characters each , if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling box in other applications , you should note these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented it , use either the button or simply change to the next image , the c@@ abling are then stored . &quot;
&quot; besides the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read further met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the met@@ ad@@ ata in files . but this is always done if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata settings , which is always written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the section review will show an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting order . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar , or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate several images at the same time , select these and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field assessment . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search@@ box for filtering of the keywords , the sample tree and a selection box with previously used in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; -@@ session attached . &quot;
the keyword is adapted dynam@@ ically to the chosen search word . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief for input from sampling in a series of images . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for fast access . &quot;
keyword can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all tags of a picture will be saved in the IP@@ TC field .
&quot; if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the sample tree , this will only be applied to the printed image and not applied to the whole selection , please read the section keyword filter . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keyword and addic@@ ts . if in addition , one or more keyword filter from the right side are used , only the cutting number of these two are displayed . all keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also pull and pull out . suppose you have selected several images in the main side . if the keyword is already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place on the selection . as a result , a dialogue that you will ask if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a cal@@ ender tag . the keyword is displayed on no means that the amount was drawn on three images . afterwards , a keyword from the right word tree was drawn up and off there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set . &quot;
this search for changes occurs at any start of the program . you can also be switched on different settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or should , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control range . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched for . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string , which is already placed in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can define an extended search across all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group@@ ing options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then take the button group@@ ing . the options look as follows : &quot;

this article / Tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mostly adapted to &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you are using a color @-@ administered workflow , the colours will have a predic@@ table devi@@ ation from the actually photographed res@@ orted colours . with a color @-@ administered workflow , you can reach the colors on your camera or the colors that you can print or publish in the web of your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the topic is on color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it must be expressed for the results he wants . unfortunately , colour management is to provide you with sufficient background information available to you to make your own informed decisions to make your own informed decisions . &quot;
&quot; if your picture flows are fulfilled every six below , then you don &apos;t need to worry about color management . &quot;
you can work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( more information can be found below )
&quot; your only different image expend@@ itu@@ res are by e @-@ mail or the web , where RGB is the de @-@ facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if so RGB is working as well and the life for everyone makes it easy , why should I use another colour space and make a thought of color indul@@ g@@ ages ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colours that we really can see is shown below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colours that we can see , the hu@@ ish @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger farms , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and click Info and then to information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to install my monitor if I decided to work only in the RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! if you are working on the RGB @-@ color space or do not , you will need to make your monitor , as s@@ RGB it &apos;s going on the circuit . if you are working as a colour space of s@@ RGB , you must use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , you must use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions to improve a picture in most cases . use it before you try a further manual processing .
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , identical , automatic current and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ t Autom@@ atic correction automatically try to make your colours the best . you &apos;ll have to experiment with these effects , which works best at your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the leu@@ ka@@ emia levels above all the image , so the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point so bright as possible without its color sha@@ dy . this function is often a Mag@@ ical correction for images which are dark or washed . &quot;
&quot; the same method uses the brightness factor of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . at times the same very good results with improving the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation which causes either miracle in a picture or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light boundary conditions and improves the red , green and blue channels on the complete hist@@ ogram area . &quot;
contrast extend : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of a picture by the post@@ p@@ one of the lowest and highest values on the maximum possible area and a new ji@@ be of all values . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
&quot; the white @-@ right of &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe , is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white @-@ down of a picture . &quot;
&quot; the white @-@ equal correction is somewhat limited to a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per suit . so , if you can do well from the original picture , areas with over@@ load @-@ mode can be done , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities will be better to correction better . &quot;
this tool is based on a Weiß@@ abolic bal@@ m of copyright protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start the menu entry colors white equal to the picture editing .
&quot; the presentation window can be adjusted in size . on the left , you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image . if you want to see the original whit@@ ish at the window , then it is enough to click on the window window . &quot;
the Pre@@ view photos features a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the spectrum at this marker is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; on the right above , a hist@@ ogram appears that dynam@@ ically changes , once you have a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on sha@@ dows , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow of your photos or di@@ mm@@ ing up . &quot;
&quot; play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then anywhere on the picture @-@ looking for the calculation of the color temperature of the white comparison . on this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the White leaves with the list of pre@@ ferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ bel@@ i@@ cht@@ i@@ cht@@ es@@ k@@ ator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pi@@ pel@@ let is displayed . this is shown in the preview of pure indication and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; storing the buttons as well as shop , make exactly this . you can store in a text file and re@@ load them later . &quot;
the button settings sets all filter values back on their default values and the associated neutral white drop @-@ down . note that neutral settings are added to another photo as your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can set the coding per color channel of the processed picture here . however , 8 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding is also required for high quality images . this coding is also required for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IFF and D@@ NG formats . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialogue such as the processing of raw images . it uses the modification and assignment of color profiles . color tone mapping can be carried out by the fore@@ panel for the use of color profiles . a detailed guidance for the use of color profiles can be applied to the chapter of color management .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors ton@@ ic correction . this tool provides an integrated way to save multiple colour channels simultaneously , so this tool is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always require the same mistakes and therefore always require the same correction . in the manual for audio correction you will find further information . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool to gra@@ dation that you will find under the colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the color effects gave you four colour effects , a solar effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a Neon Effect and a cant@@ onal filter . &quot;
&quot; in the times of the chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect that was completed by a short lighten@@ ing light , and the colour of dark areas protected by the additional light . this result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; intensity controlled the Solar@@ isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what chem@@ ically is possible . an additional increase is finally a negative image that is not to create a photo @-@ media . &quot;
this is an example of the solar energy efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy to emb@@ ell@@ ish many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a daylight optimized paint film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . its name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours during daylight and high contra@@ sts . but Vel@@ via offers some of which little landscapes seem too much .
&quot; the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repet@@ itions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . in large pictures , the filter can upgrade the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual you want to correct the colour counter and ligh@@ test photos in the menu . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you &apos;ll be used .
if you are making a photo in bad light conditions you can get the reverse issue : one too big satur@@ ation . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can be able to increase your satur@@ ation . if Him like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tools Gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ ment / Con@@ tr@@ ast / Gamma , the tool is also based on improving the exposure . even if the dialog appears to this tool very complicated , you need to explain the use of the use of the sli@@ der . more concrete is the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , hist@@ ogram , active channel or selected areas . under the graph@@ s three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into the inside and can be post@@ pon@@ ed to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and right side of the bright areas . &quot;
&quot; the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the operation is to move the regulator , and make sure how the picture changes . &quot;
&quot; on the right side you can view the original and preview of the picture . the preview is dynam@@ ically , updated on the picture . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set , whether the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis is often portra@@ yed . for images of a digital camera , linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is still useful . &quot;
&quot; three controllers : the top for the dark sounds , the middle for bright tones and the lowest for the medium tones , frequently called gam@@ em@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color@@ pin@@ ets can be used in the preview of the original image , to adjust the input of the shadow , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each range . there are also two controllers , which can be used in order to evaluate the output values , for example , to create the output values as in background , while something else can be seen in the fore@@ ground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the picture values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the picture . &quot;
store as well as charging : with these buttons the set values in the file system can be saved and later re@@ charged . the Gim@@ p levels format is used .
&quot; if you are using this mode and using three color pi@@ ds , the input will automatically be re @-@ adjusted for all shade , resources and solar tones . activate the original image of the history of red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the O@@ bel@@ i@@ cht@@ i@@ cht@@ i@@ cht@@ k@@ ator option controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels . here , it is an indicator , that means you &apos;ll get the effect only in preview , and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of the adjustments of the input applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha Channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed dynam@@ ically , depending on your settings . on the right @-@ hand side the following options are available : &quot;
&quot; modifications : this selection box allows the channel to indicate , which will be modified by the module : &quot;
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . most of the linear mode is most useful . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , linear mode generates a broad beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode provides further . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a c@@ rank@@ case to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright sounds related to dar@@ ker cav@@ ities , and the corresponding image pixel are dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red mark . if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change , a suitable line on the curve shows the original value . create a point on this line and move it on and off until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and shop : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve is created and subsequently loaded with this file system . the file format is the Gim@@ p Kur@@ ven@@ format .
&quot; if you create this method and the three color@@ pi@@ p@@ ettes of buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , central and sun tones . activate the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curves . &quot;
&quot; the option O@@ bel@@ i@@ cht@@ i@@ cht@@ i@@ k@@ ator controls all colour channels , to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than a channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . here , it is an indicator , that means you &apos;ll get the effect only in preview , and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ channel . shadow and sun tones were applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer for &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; image processing is a tool for improving the color channels or to change the color sha@@ des of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour sha@@ des of the images . you can edit it from the menu color mixer for image processing .
you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : you can adjust the color for the hist@@ ogram : you can adjust the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview of . the original can be regarded as compared to your own rider .
&quot; the preview of the target picture features a red marker . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line can be displayed in the hist@@ ogram to display the appropriate color value . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are right below : regulator for red , green and construction allow you to activate the general brightness . this is especially convenient if you are also able to activate the appropriate color components . this is especially convenient if you also have the appropriate color components to generate the production of great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portrait . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , leads the reduction of a color to a visible noise , which occurs from far@@ brau@@ schen . colour@@ ing consists of small noise species that appear in the same position in the color channel and will improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the far@@ brau@@ schen first . &quot;
&quot; storing as well as shop buttons are used for this purpose . any ender setup , you can save it later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format . &quot;
&quot; the O@@ bel@@ i@@ cht@@ i@@ cht@@ i@@ cht@@ k@@ ator option controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels . here , it is an indicator , that means you &apos;ll get the effect only in preview , and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is enabled . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photographs is black / white a step step since color pictures can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of movie roll@@ ers profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
green filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good for portrait pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filters .
orange film : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , marine scenes and air@@ photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ film . &quot;
red filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic effects and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ light to the day time . thus similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) rot@@ ators .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ timi@@ on : produces warm bright and medium tones throughout the shadow . this is very similar to the process of lighten@@ ing a pressure and re @-@ development in a sep@@ tic scho@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the image editing may apply to this image . &quot;
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the depth of depth and three @-@ dimensional texture on the picture .
a paper Tex@@ tu@@ re@@ ff@@ ect has been applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; tool framework , a decorative frame can be added to an image . &quot;
the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photos is not easy task . it is possible to keep its attention to the image . this is a psychological barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . this is a psychological barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . under photo frames the module can be started .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you have the desired frame type for your picture . the image with a colored line , Nie@@ p@@ ce is surrounded by a thin line and a wide range ( ideal for black @-@ and white pictures ) , a decorative three @-@ dimensional frame that adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : is the width of the frame in percent . the range of value for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target picture will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is greater than the original , especially if you used the tool after the aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can insert single @-@ form@@ at@@ ted text in a picture at any point . this also goes in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text , and place it with the mouse . use text excerpt , orientation , colour from colour space and character set with its qualities as you need . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a c@@ auti@@ ous background . the image is ready . &quot;
&quot; every attitude you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click on the button &quot; OK &quot; . after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ plug ; tool sten@@ cil to apply a sten@@ cil about an image .
the menu icon template apply in picture editing can be used to lay templates above a picture .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil , there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to work the P@@ NG file format and should add with maximum compres@@ sing ( 9 ) to remove the file size of the template . simply send an email in English to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; mail@@ ing@@ list di@@ gi@@ l @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you are using this tool for the first time , you &apos;ll have to set your template folder with the button base folders in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template file . this settings will notice for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder for the sten@@ cils is set out , a size view which reflects the folder structure of the template . the selection of a folder is updated automatically . &quot;
under the preview there are three buttons on which you can change the enlargement factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the underlying picture . it is cent@@ ered around the position of mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; shr@@ inks : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of mouse . if you want to use the template on the whole image , check the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
use OK when you want to use the template on your image . then the image will be adapted to the fore@@ se@@ atic size .
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ um , there are three different tool to shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you have advantages in other areas . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool to shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; Un@@ shar@@ pen mask works on the contrast of the edges with a picture shar@@ per . indeed , it is not a bit more psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric dark and it is done here a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and he is protected by Win@@ ston Chang . &quot;
&quot; the focus is possibly the best of the three , as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt . &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alised images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is the fact that the dig@@ itali@@ zation process can be put together with only minimum differences to a colour . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . SLR cameras do normally need more than normal cameras for the private user .
&quot; in JPEG pictures , a camera has been applied for internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the rough format , however , must always be scre@@ ened during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanners are already using an shar@@ pen@@ ing filter during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able this , you will get control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you can receive useful outcomes by sharp@@ est a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing of shar@@ pen@@ ing . you can al@@ locate to the menu entry .
&quot; you should handle it carefully , as the results do not work very naturally : shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , you will find more information about the menu entry . under re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution , the image a little soft to draw , is considerably easier than it . use the tool for a soft character with the menu entry , adjust the effect on your photo . &quot;
filter un@@ sharp m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove mu@@ dge from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview can help edit the picture . it shows the preview of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or amount increases the effect . if you make the un@@ equal mask to strong , noise and impression of grass in the proximity of sharp edges produce . &quot;
the radius is how many pixels are affected on each side by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radio stations . therefore you should shar@@ pen images best in its final resolution .
&quot; the amount indicates the percentage between the original and the illustration , which is added to the original . thereby , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the differential amount . it can therefore define a minimal difference thus , with a soft change between tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore beauty errors in faces , heavens and water surface . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; tool re@@ focus is focused on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected un@@ f@@ iss@@ ing filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool is trying to make a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ si@@ er@@ c . this is better approach to shar@@ pen@@ ing . this is better approach to shar@@ pen@@ ing images . this is a better approach to shar@@ pen@@ ing images . you can usually start editing images as un@@ sharp . you can start from the menu by retri@@ eving colours .
&quot; in practice , the circular flow is much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s F@@ oot . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ oot has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pi@@ x@@ ae , which is far from the original cable pixel , which is far from the original pixel size , causing un@@ wanted results . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular file . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should be 1 good results . if your image is very un@@ sharp , however , in Heiligen@@ damm . &quot;
&quot; correlation : increasing the correlation can help to reduce arter@@ ies . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ sive effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values can be reduced from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 is very bad . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a suitable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will continue to merge the picture . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your un@@ shar@@ pen is caused by un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed filters . in most cases , you should not use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts , so you may also increase the correlation and / or check the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; size : this value determines the size of transform@@ ation@@ at@@ rix , which can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular edge or the Gau@@ ge of the focus . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; storing as well as shop buttons are used for that purpose . any Re@@ focus parameters will be placed , that will be saved for later and then can be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try all the cutting , colour and intensity structures on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture below . the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible , but later leave un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you read pictures and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , it produces un@@ sharp m@@ asked for better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by a sharp m@@ asked one larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically , it is always necessary to produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of un@@ shar@@ pen . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters you can show that it is the optimum linear mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better for processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a comparison between different filters on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to un@@ enough light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information regarding the methods of shar@@ pen@@ ing processes in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the regulator is de@@ composed by the sharp@@ ness of the division &apos;s sharp@@ ness , to create a more natural pup@@ il . &quot;
&quot; the colour tin@@ te allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want to keep blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool image bug@@ fix is one of the most advanced tool to remove non @-@ desired arter@@ ies with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting Algorith@@ m was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre@@ ferences as Star@@ points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail protection p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preser@@ vation of the details . a small value leads to a smooth glass @-@ he@@ ap over the image . if larger values are concentrated mainly hom@@ o@@ gens regions and are sharp . a value of 0.9 should get more details that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ ed evenly into all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a movie setting or CCD noise will generate a high level of wave similar patterns . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te will be best fixed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all . p then define the relative gl@@ ass@@ ment . therefore , set this value as a degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more will be smooth@@ ed , as it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repeat : indicates how often the algorithm is run through . usually 1 or 2 goes out .
&quot; An@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . An@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . An@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small selected , it should also be selected small . make sure that small angle produce a long run@@ time . make sure that small angle produce a long run@@ time . so , you should select this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step @-@ length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step @-@ length in pixels . you should avoid the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more high quality you can get by selecting this option is only low . it doubles the running time . we recommend it to allow him .
the buttons stores and loading exactly this . any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and later re@@ charged .
&quot; image errors is compar@@ atively very fast to work . however , it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load . so you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button demol@@ ition . &quot;
below you can see how image errors with little arti@@ facts will be corrected . the module will be applied on a photo that is created in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a distinctive black Ar@@ te@@ e@@ t in the fore@@ ground that creates a bad movie camp during the journey . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter H@@ ert .
this tool provides selected image filters to remove spots and other arti@@ facts which come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor scre@@ aming from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need more information about digital cameras , you can read this tut@@ orial in English in this tut@@ orial . &quot;
&quot; the screenshot above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny , which can be successfully removed with this tool . &quot;
&quot; in the following example , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub @-@ window advanced settings can remain at default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time required for filters per pixel . the image is p@@ umped over the image and the color in it becomes smooth@@ ed and thus smaller bugs fixed . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the shar@@ pen@@ ing distance . this value puts the pixel pitch of the filter to the front , if it is increased , you may need to change noise levels . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can &apos;t get more and noise or sm@@ ashing up . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong it can &apos;t remove the whole noise or noise damage . if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the picture . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings will not affect the smooth@@ ing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the colour tolerance of the picture . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings will not affect the smooth@@ ing process controlled by the details settings .
&quot; gamma : controls the eye tolerance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of dar@@ ker sections , which are typically stronger , however , the shadow areas too . &quot;
&quot; damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing atten@@ u@@ ation . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance may occur . if it is lifted , noise and Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ acks may appear on the edges . it can remove noise levels and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
&quot; store and loading : these buttons are used for this . all parameters for the noise reduction , which you have set , can be stored into the file system and later charges later . &quot;
this is an example of how cat@@ er@@ decrease your life can change . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected version ( 2 ) and is used with default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution , the picture is a little soft to draw , is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen , and experim@@ enting with the gl@@ ar . see the impact on the right side of the dialog it shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo file .
&quot; this filter for the restoration process gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ wanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film@@ makers , scrat@@ ches , compression , compression and comp@@ il@@ able pictures of image con@@ tours and thus preser@@ ves the content as it does the human eye . &quot;
the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ tures . the tex@@ tual build is performed with another tool that has been developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ya and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ ase Redu@@ ce JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts : JPEG compression is not perfect in some areas even very far from it . as a loss of compres@@ sive compression cells he creates some Com@@ pres@@ sions &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards that correct in un@@ compressed image . this attitude shall correct this problem .
the buttons stores and loading exactly this . every attitude of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo Rest@@ oration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load . therefore you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce like a photo with equal noise . the module is used on a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film @-@ grain on the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected beneath ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures was reduced to an old color picture which has been read with an old scanner . you can see the scan @-@ arti@@ facts which have been created by the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ light and the photo @-@ image ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; tools Hot@@ pixel allows it to remove hot pixel of photos which have been taken with a CCD camera , eight were used . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially at high @-@ quality raw material photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixels . &quot; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button dark . the tool will detect the hot and bright pixels . they are highlighted in the picture preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to detect the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or light pixels using CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the right image to the correct image . please note that the assistant will notice the last dark pattern and automatically re@@ plen@@ ish at the next session . &quot;
the image area and preview can help you correct within the picture . the presentation window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are emphas@@ ized in all fore@@ seen areas .
select an area around the defective pixels at the preview and the results of the filter . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ l this pixel size . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ation : an average of the neighbor pixel is determined . the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels within the block . this is done separately for horizontal and vertical poles .
linear : all pixels having a distance of 1 from pixel &apos;s pixels are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to a pixel pitch will be moved to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block . &quot;
cubic : all pixel with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a colour photo taken from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to see . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is listed under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ zing correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ation , i.e. inferior corners , a picture . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lens , in particular the middle and large photo format , often can be evenly lit up the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sha@@ dy ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by showing the light the sensor there . tel@@ em@@ esis show this behavior too . &quot;
&quot; but he also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the blood filter which increases the required sealing time under circumstances , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also be able to use an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed effects caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s filters and the colour and grey stu@@ cco tools , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by a similar transformation into a shell that without this filter is applied , the tool is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ zing correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of lumin@@ ous absorption at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density amounts to 2,0 , by chance to compens@@ ate for a larger degree of Vig@@ net@@ ation , reduce it by a small degree of Vig@@ net@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; leu@@ k@@ age , contrast and gamma settings : editing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ zation correction will reduce the brightness of the pixel . you have to re@@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options , as you have to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a more sensitive new adjustment of the target image , the values for lumin@@ ous / contrast / Gamma in zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; dict@@ ment ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ zation correction to a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ stat in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a leu@@ ka@@ emia and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; lenti@@ l dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenti@@ ls on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion . colour dist@@ ortion can not be corrected with this tool .
&quot; the second degree is the general geomet@@ rical dist@@ ortion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or conv@@ ex form of the picture . &quot;
&quot; the third @-@ degree body has a similar round@@ about effect , but fl@@ att@@ ened to the edges . this correction is not used in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the fourth degree order has been corrected the distant corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion can be eliminated almost eliminated . &quot;
in general : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion second degree . with negative values can be corrected tonn@@ e @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion and dist@@ ortion positive values .
corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion @-@ fourth degree . this value seems more strongly in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; corners Parameter changed the sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and leads to a correction of first grade . negative values increase while reducing the image .
brigh@@ ten : this value defines the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the picture in the corners while positive values increase it .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog is illustrated by a preview of dist@@ ortion well . the values you use for your image will be saved , and using the next start as default values . &quot;
the tonn@@ e or rib@@ bon correction should be done prior to all conc@@ ision - or size changes . best you will perform this correction as all the first . if you do a new picture and after that a tonn@@ e @-@ shaped correction would be the effect to be observed .
&quot; to help you find the best corrected , this tool allows you to display a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image , and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in the connection , you can correct the tonn@@ e / sh@@ itty dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you corrected a sh@@ itty dist@@ ortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can attach these with the cutting tool into menu transform@@ ers , or remove this dialogue with the using regulator of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures the tonn@@ e @-@ shaped correction is enough . the next logical step for some moti@@ ves like photos from the front , frame and paintings it is the perspective so correct to correct all the angles in the picture 90 degrees . if you keep the camera with the hand , you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the tonn@@ e @-@ shaped correction for a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film about the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web site which is accessible under this URL . filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left of the window , you can choose the range for the preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can see the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the preview you can set up two parameter setting and film sensitivity . if you want to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film , the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and predomin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in converting . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter channels are mixed to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos , as the colour information are missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ red fil@@ et list based on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the Spitz@@ lich@@ ens .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; filter film @-@ grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film@@ makers on your pictures . this is of classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known for the sensitivity of the films to increase the manufacturers large silver grains of the photo@@ emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film@@ making effect gives your photo a certain mood , or seems to move back into the past . if you want to get rid of this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ ined sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is although higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of fil@@ ming effect on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) , and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice looks like an oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the top cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush are better for large pictures . smooth@@ ing controls the glass or , from the other side , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and that worked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 @-@ pixel size is 1 and gl@@ ar 17 .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe came ; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal mine . therefore , images of gra@@ dients are not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators with a value range from 1 to 100 , to control this effect . the upper regulator sel@@ ects the pin size and adjust the contrast ( glass ) . &quot;
this is an example of the carbon filter filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjust@@ ing the intensity value .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; filter engraving shaped your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; filter engraving is a quick tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with pictures with a simple structure , in which color does not use the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , Mongo@@ lian scenery . &quot;
&quot; depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of engra@@ ver filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal picture into a work of art by dist@@ ortion effects . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; wave blocks 1 : share the picture in cells , and lets it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks . &quot;
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wavel@@ eng@@ ths 1 is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can break these effects anytime with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal picture into a work of art by in@@ shar@@ pen effects . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom In@@ shar@@ pen : wi@@ pe out the picture along stone @-@ shaped lines the point out of a centre . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ pen and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
Radi@@ al Un@@ shar@@ pen : wi@@ red the picture by rotation of the pixels around a center . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ shar@@ pen of a rotating camera .
distance un@@ shar@@ pen : wi@@ red the picture to create a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to re@@ sign in the background .
&quot; movement @-@ shar@@ pen : wi@@ red the picture through horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ pen of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera . &quot;
&quot; so@@ res the picture soft in the dark and strongly in bright notes . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour @-@ photos or add a warm and subtle light . &quot;
sho@@ ok shar@@ pen : wi@@ ped out the image by random shift of pixel and sim@@ ulates the im@@ shar@@ pen of an arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent Un@@ shar@@ pen : finds the sink in the picture and wi@@ pe them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it through the col@@ t with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . they can therefore inter@@ rupt you using the button .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make control drops to your picture . this makes it natural your pictures a n@@ icious look . it uses a Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright protected algorithm .
drop @-@ size allows to change the size of the drops . because the drop @-@ size is not automatically mit@@ able with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size and density of drops . fish out changes the optical effect of drop in the image .
&quot; you can hold with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; image editing a field free of rain drops . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should be free to stay free . if you then start the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen the area will remain free of shelves . &quot;
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can carry it through sk@@ e@@ wers or turning into the right orientation . the tools do you find in the menu Transform@@ ers turning or trans@@ forming sk@@ e@@ wers . &quot;
photo bra@@ c@@ ases is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to get a photo of enlarge at a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is , how can you see a picture on the screen and the details are sharp ? how can you find out the missing information again ? how can one see the missing information again ? how can one see the missing information here , make it a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it on the desired size with the tool size . select transformation size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; the tool used to change a linear interaction method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow up . &quot;
&quot; many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. spl@@ ot@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm has been developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
&quot; adjust aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , when entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more will be smooth@@ ed , as it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the buttons stores , as well as loading , all input can be used . zoom can be uploaded as text file and later re@@ charges later . &quot;
&quot; photo bra@@ cts is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can break the calculation anytime with the button . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles by using a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 2 ) is the result of the linear equation by comparison .
&quot; the cutting of a picture is not just a frequently performed surgery but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a photo , simply remove the rectangle with the mouse , through the mouse button , and drag the rectangle . you will then see this rectangle over you . &quot;
&quot; when you get rid of the mouse button , the pictures of the photos will be cut off . by doing so you can make a good overview of your photo after the cutting edge . you can draw the size of the area to cut off the rectangle . you can create a new rectangle with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the cutting cut , use the kno@@ b button in the tool bar and the photo is delivered ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries to save or save the file to save the newly designed photo . &quot;
&quot; in the field of view , you can change the size of the rectangle by shifting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog stays . &quot;
&quot; in tool with aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format the larger value of the height and width of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool with aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always equal , regardless of whether you are centi@@ meter , In@@ ch or any other physical size . for example , you can see a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialogue , there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can set the maximum kno@@ b for cutting on the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool , according to the aspect ratio , saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tically ) . if you use the cutting tool into the next time , these settings are displayed as default in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data can reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
the att@@ itudes of coll@@ ating help allow for help to send your pictures better . these help are :
&quot; harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third party , harmon@@ ious triangles is a possibility to divide a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles on the diagonal . &quot;
golden center : the golden center is a partition to different natural growth pattern like the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus pussy or the pet@@ als of a sunflower . it emerg@@ es in all sorts of things we feel nicely .
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you &apos;ve been using the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to con@@ struct your temples and pyr@@ am@@ ids , in order to give your images , buildings and even photos to give your creation a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the following divi@@ der is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition is considered vis@@ ually harmon@@ ic . &quot;
the golden center provides liquid aux@@ iliary lines when you create a picture . these help are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third party , the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of spir@@ als and creates a symmet@@ rical visual river . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called gold rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles is used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this can be simply because of its own eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the golden triangles are also from the above mentioned golden spiral . their stake points are the middle points of the golden square . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious triangles , golden triangles are not equivalent to these lines . diagonal to this lines can be a static object more dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden triangles in order to break out your frame you create a effect of professional phot@@ ograph@@ ers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach differently .
the options Horizont@@ ally mirror and vertical mirror can be used to flip the harmon@@ ic particles .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the aux@@ iliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aux@@ iliary lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adapt the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the Free rotation is a tool to rotate any picture at any angle .
&quot; if you do a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which the things are rot@@ ated at an angle . you can repair this with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; image editing and tool free rotation . select transform@@ ers free rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
&quot; turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . with the button settings , you can reset the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of Rotation can be displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be displayed on the right . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the Free press provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse pointing to the two lines . after you have moved it via an important point of the picture you can adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have shot a picture , you &apos;ll find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . it is possible to repair the function transform@@ ers from the picture editing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is the machine Automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option allows the image a bit after turning . please note the above warning .
all per@@ si@@ zing transform@@ ations are performed by a fixing point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new picture , including the empty areas which are caused by the transformation into pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new picture , including the empty areas which are caused by the transformation into pixels . &quot;
angle to the top : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees of the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees of the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjust@@ ing the perspective , the image becomes a bit dirty . this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after passing the perspective , you will receive unbe@@ arab@@ ic tri@@ angular holes at the corners . an opportunity to transfer this is to cut the image with transform@@ ers from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite side . this is no rotation , the picture will be dist@@ orted to the picture . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about transformation sciss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; pull your picture by using the Horizont@@ al angle and the vertical angle , you can horizontal and vertically at the same time . if you press on default , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed right from the display area . &quot;
&quot; to help your help , a vertical and horizontal line is built . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to adjust the lines to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after having been carried out the shot , the picture will be caught a little bit . for a single loop this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two scar@@ ves ought to avoid double the amount and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after shooting , the picture has in@@ sol@@ dered tri@@ angular holes in the corners . an opportunity to eliminate this is to cut the image with transform@@ ers from image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way like these libraries . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; due to that dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all the file formats available on their system , but you will always find JPEG and T@@ IFF . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; only files in formats used to know . this happens based on the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the expansion in the list is listed , you can change this list of file exp@@ and@@ ations ; you can change this list of file expansion . in the section configuration , you can find further information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IFF . some cameras allow you to choose to use this format . more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital pictures . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on an efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smo@@ other results as JPEG under the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also save loss @-@ free if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the shell format , you can read more about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format images in JPEG or T@@ IFF with the Roh@@ mer Converter of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; you can find further information on the use of modules with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore . &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; supported the store of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is included in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore . all cameras can be seen below at the Web @-@ site of Dave Coff@@ in . table below shows a short list of raw formats that come from &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of a short films . these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . if you are not able to preview or edit the movies . if you click on a Movie File . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings for playback of movies use to play the program at playback .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit the geographical data in the EX@@ IF keyword of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools available to loc@@ alize pictures geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itud@@ inal and lat@@ itude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as a XML file in GP@@ X format and g@@ ps@@ man you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
fig . Ge@@ ograph@@ ical location Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and call the menu . in order to run a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you have to upload a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , such as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if the file is uploaded to an automatic correlation , the coordinates are recorded in red . GPS track data will be recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera will need to be reck@@ oned with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . Click here for your camera language . &quot;
the maximum devi@@ ation for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a higher devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera capacity . the devi@@ ation below are the data collected . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no track data from one place for pictures you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
&quot; the options of inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have a suitable data . if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can put these borders here and then cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates may be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog box is added to the next , you must only use the button OK to set the data on the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found with the displayed map and is set . select the appropriate region and increase it again , until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the card can always be selected and manually . the card can be changed between card @-@ mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool used to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a m@@ peg video in a m@@ asch@@ au form .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the di@@ ash@@ au . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically generated on the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can create a background colour for the di@@ ash@@ au . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVI CD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn . &quot;
you must first choose the pictures to be packed into MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards you can create via ex@@ tras m@@ asch@@ au to the module .
the pictures of the selected images are listed below picture files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting of images or the content of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , E@@ CD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you are planning to set the File on a TV , you &apos;ll need to set the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely to make the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds to indicate a picture below . the speed of the picture above is specified . a lower value produces very sudden change , a high contrast , very smooth . &quot;
&quot; the background colour can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can adjust the name and path to the generated file under name of the m@@ peg file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a audio file under name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the film . after you can add all settings to your wishes , you can go quickly or drink at all the rest of your computer . depending on your computer &apos;s speed , you can enjoy a coffee and drink the di@@ abo@@ o if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages to the right below . &quot;
&quot; the printer assistance allows for printing multiple images on a paper paper , together in standard photo@@ sizes . this can be automatically opened with the image processing g@@ p . this is for example , to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import / convert your images stored in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ sharing tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . a original quote from Him is : do not expect them from d@@ cra@@ w to get the same results as the software from your camera makers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results !
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file that is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image window appears in mode for a single picture . with the button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can now re@@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings should be utilized for the White leaves . if the result is not optimal , you can continue editing the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so you can use the contrast information . if your camera is in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are happy with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame is equal and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG using a low @-@ loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the tagged Image format , T@@ IFF , reserves all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to process your pictures frequently or otherwise you should not use the JPEG format , as it wor@@ sen@@ ed only a limited number of operations before the picture quality deterior@@ ates . T@@ IFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the met@@ ad@@ ata is stored in the RA@@ W file in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF file . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to re @-@ stop this process , you can use off . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acking mode allows you to convert various pictures to once . use this mode , so if you are safe , for example using a single image that are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the option to write automatically . this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt . however , the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix to set the starting numbers and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the image from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can size the image shr@@ inks or enlarge . in addition four types of images are made available :
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the picture will be selected automatically , depending on the picture orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen size .
not proportional : no proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio will be changed at this option .
&quot; pressure preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo print . the user can set up the printing solution and size of the phot@@ op@@ le@@ iers . the target picture , including background size , edge and background colour is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . there is also possible to change the size of additional pictures below . other pictures can draw on the list of the images and leave there . &quot;
&quot; after having started the module , the pictures window with the selected images will be displayed . read the button pictures you can add to a file extensions . for the recently selected image will be a preview of the right image . &quot;
you can also pull pictures from the picture list and add it to the list of selected images .
&quot; with the button pictures , the selected images are removed from the list of selected pictures . &quot;
&quot; once you have selected all the pictures you can open with the button OK , the new message window of your E @-@ mail clients . you &apos;ll just need to add the addresses and the subject line . those selected pictures are attached as anne@@ x . &quot;
make sure not send to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts do not send restrictions to the size of the E @-@ mails . it may possibly be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
&quot; the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for the sending of the images . your configuration is stored and every time , until you change it again . &quot;
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify in the input field below the right path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you have to install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download this here . &quot;
&quot; after the choice of comments in a attached file , the comments are attached to the text in a text file and attached the mail . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG format under the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adjusted among the los@@ s@@ less formats such as T@@ IFF . therefore , you should have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG under pictures file format and then select the original files in JPEG format , then the original file data will be added to sen@@ ed pictures . &quot;
&quot; if the process is finished , the window will not automatically be closed , so you can view the status messages when searching for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button scra@@ p you can change this window ? en . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module &apos;s Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions such as you want to have shown your di@@ ash@@ au . you can select here between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL @-@ trans@@ itions option in the presentation will be activated , using Open@@ GL . however , you have to own a corresponding graphics card because otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slowly . &quot;
the file name can indicate that the file name of the pictures will be displayed in the left bottom point during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . afterwards you can break manually with Es@@ c .
the option images are random@@ ly chosen to show that the pictures are displayed in a random sequence . so it is not used to order pictures in the album .
&quot; under delay between the pictures , the time distance between the pictures can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should show this presentation your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen trans@@ itional effects between which you can choose . by chance to select a different effect between the pictures .
&quot; during the Di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool bar on the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch . &quot;
&quot; with this tool bar , you can start the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the di@@ ash@@ au . &quot;
&quot; on the left bottom screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the whole number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background picture for the working surface .
&quot; this module sets up the current selected image , depending on the selected option of sub@@ men@@ cement , as a background for your K@@ DE @-@ working surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; photo album , see picture . as you can see through this browser , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , so in persons , places and in group keywords are present . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you can see the categories , for which you have given information than you have access your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look at the EX@@ IF based information and see the actual aspect images . in the following , each of them are described . &quot;
&quot; if you hit the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person only the pictures are displayed , on which both persons are visible . by this selection method , you can restri@@ ct the number of pictures shown by a few thousand images on a few single pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view a look at the pictures of your activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture every person is the same symbol before its name . however , you can save with &amp; photo album ; but for each person , you can save their own image , the same applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined themselves . see the picture here . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button , which can be set on the right on the tool@@ bar . in this case you can choose the view to the current category . please note that you can view the view for each category separately ( if you have no suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to define what image for every single person is to be displayed . in order to do this , you &apos;ll need to select a categories of image editor , as shown in the image window . in the An@@ si@@ t window , you can select the magni@@ fying factor after your needs and thus select which part of the picture is to be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for the entry in the main window , you will receive a dialogue that is very similar to the dialog for determining the image properties . this dialog can look at the image even more . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the field Lab@@ eling or Description , you can also enter the labelling and descriptions of the pictures according to this text , so you can also enter a date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here goes to pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; photo album ; if you don &apos;t like to read books , but rather to try your manu@@ als , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; photo album ; and check out the quick @-@ entry screen TV and introduc@@ tory videos .
&quot; start &amp; photo album ; and select the demo album , if you start &amp; photo album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry into a photo album ; and then select some sample images and you can test the functions of &amp; photo album ; try out . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , please find it on the homepage of &amp; photo album ; as a related HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; photo album ; see the tim@@ eline . you can see the tim@@ eline here . as the name suggests , this l@@ acks will show you data base statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar shows a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . in the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline you can use on the following ways : you can change the displayed entries from the database ( when you select a date , the first image of this date will be shown in the preview page ) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the tim@@ eline . if you select a range , you &apos;ll just check images of this period . you can click the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; photo album ; make you two options available to create HTML pages with your pictures . the one is in &amp; photo album ; integrated and the other as a module available ( see ) in the following part of the user name is written in &amp; photo album ; built in &amp; photo album that you can create via the File @-@ File ...
&quot; before using HTML pages , you will need to make some settings . these are split into the three areas of content , layout and finish . in the following , every area is discussed . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the over@@ lay and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on photo album ; HTML example pages , you can see an example for this settings . &quot;
next you choose whether a &amp; photo album ; -@@ export file is to be created on the review page . feed information about export files you will find in .
&quot; last , you can select which information should be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information that are displayed in the viewer without description . for example , that all pictures of a party are obvious . for example , you can not use this attitude to hide certain pictures from certain amount . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most of the site possibilities are clear , which is why this is not specially made . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of this page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . by doing this , those who want to consider your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x@@ 600 , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer &apos;s viewers can change the resolution at any time you &apos;ve specified . so , it is possible to obtain your pictures with low resolution , as well . if he wants to get a larger image larger , it changes to higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this installation area , you place the various folder and the URL , where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , select a basic folder for all of your HTML files and for each subsequent set , a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main folder , in which all your pictures are stored . this folder is automatically added to the location . this file allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if these are really all required for viewing . if you choose to select a web browser after the pages are created , the URL that you can define here , the web browser should start in the wrong folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are not able to copy the HTML files in the final destination folder , you will need to manually copy the import function , see , correctly , you have to specify the final destination of files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the installation options described above have all three on base folders and UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you can set in output file . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a family party , meeting at a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ album , you may need to add a HTML page to viewing the images , you may have to add a lot of time to view the pictures , recording , etc . , you have to do with &amp; photo album ; this work is not even done . &quot;
with &amp; photo album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import files into your database . these can be imported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different kinds of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it whether the images are stored in the file or whether it can only be stored in the file , that you can put all the pictures together and that file is so independent , however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the images in two times . first of all , the pictures of the images that are displayed in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file via HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , dialog will be described for the Export of images , which allows you to export the menu file ... &quot;
the main option of this dialog is whether internal or external .@@ k@@ im files should take action . there are the following three selection options available :
&quot; with the manual option , you will need to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option automatic to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; photo album , the pictures automatically for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most pictures already have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is normally not to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress the export file , simply select the export file . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is Maximum image size . if you send your friends pictures , the images may not be in full size because the .@@ k@@ im -@@ file might be very big here , as the .@@ k@@ im -@@ file might be very big here , as you can say that each picture should be 800 pixel high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import@@ ing ... select , &amp; photo album ; the exp@@ orting database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the assistant to imports consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , afterwards , in which folder the import pictures are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you can person@@ ell the category passengers to the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is in the third dialog window , which are to be imported in the third dialog window , which categories must be imported in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the import file with the categories of your current database . an example of this will be seen in the image . &quot;
&quot; it must be simple to browse the pictures and look at the pictures : when you see pictures , you may often see pictures of your Italy holiday groups and discover an image with your friend to discover , you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the different steps of ( 1 ) set the information about your pictures , over ( 2 ) search and look through ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ t@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today , it also takes care of your videos . on many places in this manual will also be read about images , but often these videos do not matter . &quot;
&quot; photo album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file , which you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. nor@@ mals or revisions in CV@@ S , where they want . &quot;
&quot; photo album , don &apos;t notice the folder in which your pictures are stored and used to start a different folder with pictures , so you can start a different folder with pictures , you can start with the -@@ c option . as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
clicking on the menu entry into a photo album ; enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo album ; in the following section of the user &apos;s book will be explained to you the various setup possibilities .
&quot; to the left , you can see six different symbols , with which you can call for viewing the viewer and the options for the viewer . for each setting is an exhau@@ st@@ ive help to access the F1 button and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can describe your own groups , such as items , places and tags for each picture . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog , which is used to process existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a labelling and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete assembly groups , i.e. , all members of a group set at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as in . &quot;
&quot; in view of the installation possibilities , which are available to you for determining the membership groups . with the above @-@ reviewed selection list you can configure the category you want to configure . in the left window , you can choose a list of the current category and in the right list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; photo album ; his modul@@ arity is shared with other graphics applications such as di@@ gi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plug@@ in Interface . feed information here you can find on the website of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can not be described in this manual , because they are not part of &amp; photo album ; but most modules have a help page , which you can call over the module . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used by several applications to each other , it may be that the modules are tested with the demo database . this is why you should always call new modules first with the demo file via user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . do not say , I would not have been warned . &quot;
&quot; applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; photo album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage , when you share functions with various applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that can also apply K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported by albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; photo album , this kind of order does not support albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo album . &quot;
&quot; sim@@ ulates &amp; photo album , the current album , which is just the current view , so all the pictures you are viewing the photo preview . &quot;
besides the current album &amp; photo album ; the modules are handed over a list of albums . here goes &amp; photo album ; as follows :
&quot; if &amp; photo album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then every record of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category you have set in the dialog box as a category for virtual albums , so if you choose the category individuals , so if you have selected persons to view the view and give it to the module . &quot;
&quot; as some modules with &amp; photo album , which are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog , and select modules which modules are to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example for a starting screen as soon as you start &amp; photo album , starting with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you can use it from any other K@@ DE application , you can see at the top a menu and a tool bar . at the moment we will see the window , as you don &apos;t see any information about your pictures . in the section we will see on this window , now please click on the entry pictures , which shows you an overview of all existing pictures . &quot;
&quot; one of the main features of &amp; photo album ; is the possibility to see any picture with notes on the picture , where the image has been recorded , etc . you can set any image either individually or for a bigger number of pictures certain notes at the same time . if , for example , on all images Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures were included in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for searching and brows@@ ing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes if you are using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo album , as you can always use information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on the most of the images within the list : if you have shown for example a family party and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can find that the names are moved up and arrange the people faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to see an alphabetical list of the list , click on the icon for sorting on the list . &quot;
&quot; if you select comments for each picture individually , you may want to edit all selected images and provide these pictures with notes . in this case simply click on the front and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture right . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu option to be used with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an inter @-@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the dialog@@ s is it possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also take an entry to a category and make it down to order this to a sub@@ category of this entry . note , this assumes that you just sort your categories alpha@@ be@@ tically sort . see also . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the dialog@@ s by clicking on the frames that form the upper edge of the frame , click and post@@ p@@ one . you can also make a window in a frame by turning him out of window frames . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button Op@@ tions ... , which offers you the opportunity to store the current construction and the appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave this window as well . if you would like to check out this window later , use the button options ... and then window a / out . this process can be seen in the picture here . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser , you will have an overview of preview images of currently selected images , or any images if you do not have any filters . for example , you can configure the size of the visual images by simply down to the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; when you click on a picture , this image will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have any window with a picture viewer , a new display window is created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the image review . simply select the corresponding pictures from you , and press select either the remove button or select the menu Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&amp; photo album ; offers you a solution to this problem . you can also use with &amp; photo album ; namely pictures you can use on the hard disk . of course you &apos;ll have to record the pictures somewhere else in the database index . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; photo album ; if not all required images from the hard disk can be loaded .
&quot; pictures where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the images are available , so you can view these pictures from this image . however , you can &apos;t see these pictures with the picture viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see this function , you will need to copy files from the folders and copy them back . if you don &apos;t want to avoid any of your pictures yet , please buy a larger disk in order to store all the images . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that you can see for other un@@ accessible . alternatively , you can also view all pictures you can see your little sister , increase and select the menu entry to all aside . &quot;
&quot; so you have set those pictures in the case of the case hidden . if you insert the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , simply select the images that you have blocked off . if you want to check the images again , click on Sper@@ re . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to establish a password which must be entered to unlock the images . in order to set up this password , simply dial password change . &quot;
&quot; please remember that this photo protection is not very safe , if you can read or delete any images on the hard disk and to the other , anyone who can read the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file or delete this kind of password protection . this kind of password protection is not used to susp@@ end the view of private images . &quot;
the reason why you &apos;re all your pictures with &amp; photo album ; manage and spend hours on hours to describe it is of course you want to look at some point . for this reason it has a photo _ and video viewer . this is a preview of how described in .
&quot; the viewer you can see in seeing . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter the picture , like who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the information box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can also pull it out with the mouse and elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed on the viewer . all these options are displayed after a right click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on the browser , please refer to Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by clicking the keys to the picture and jump up . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu . &quot;
if several pictures are uploaded in the viewer you can run this as di@@ ash@@ au . then you will download a new picture after a few seconds . how often there is a new picture will be controlled by clicking the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus and halt the di@@ asch@@ au by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful capability of the viewer from &amp; photo album ; is it in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the whole space on the screen . simply use the input button to change in full screen mode and back .
&quot; if you are using the viewer you can go into the image and zo@@ oming . in the mouse , you can simply pull a rectangle with the mouse button . in the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out in the middle of the picture and shows how a zoom @-@ rectangle is shown and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the balance sheet the zo@@ oms , so each pixel indicates a pixel size of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work with videos that come in and out zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and minus key .
&quot; with the features of the context menu , you can turn the image . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can make remarks related to the current image with the menu option comments from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking at pictures , you can find a picture with a person whose name you must have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can watch the picture and check configuration dialog of the image to mark these names , but you may only mark the picture and see more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and see them as good or bad , while you see one after the other . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer give you the opportunity to view images with features , while you are viewing . features are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature by pressing the corresponding character . in view a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . so , you can see all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , so simply enter all on once with notes . this is described in order to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can display categories in DR@@ E preview view , then you can print features into the pictures by clicking simply the letters for the feature after the image has been selected . you can see here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; photo album ; painting on the picture .
&quot; the painting is not stored with the image , but in the database . on the way you can make your common old later . &quot;
you can see a picture on the painted picture . to switch the painting in &amp; photo album ; simply select the painting from the context menu . to end the painting you just press the cross in the tool bar at the top of the window .
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ pin , you need to work the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not completely control , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties will be shown in the object characteristics and the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
&quot; you can also select several objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected using the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you are multiple possible positions , then the next menu will appear , so you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with delete either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click on users to take these changes . if you have invali@@ d values , a message appears with an error description . then you can click on the input commands , or click the changes to ab@@ rupt . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter User &apos;s User manual , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 also contains the user documentation .
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview of your self @-@ mind view . &quot;
&quot; press a preview of the scene &apos;s own , and a small example of the scene is drawn with the selected texture . if you want to have a sub@@ ordin@@ ated element , even if you want an underground item , even if you want to render a piece in texture @-@ map and not the whole texture @-@ map ) , cross locally . &quot;
the screenshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag this control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marked the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts in the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a wire model , as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the higher object or rather than absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level lower or equal to the line of the visibility level in the scene . &quot;
&amp; Cool@@ ing ; has a window arrangement as default . the object &apos;s tree and the view of the object characteristics are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the default settings , or if you need another arrangement , you can set them up . you can also store multiple window orders and simply change between different orders . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below a view of view , drag the facade to the top or lower edge of a view . a rectangle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the right to the right or left side of a view . the new view is mounted on the right @-@ hand side of this view and extends across the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views on each other , go right in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views across the flash@@ cards above in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views , which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . in order to solve a view from the installation , drag the right button to the bottom right on top of the arrow . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the facade bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are weak , you can anchor them at any point . &quot;
&quot; you can save the current window view , store windows , save it . it will be a dialog displayed in which you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ dering , this program was written correctly . when this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click the symbol Ren@@ dering the symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool bar or select the menu entry to the scene . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s In@@ i files . it determines image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to ren@@ dering a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can add many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to full images . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the symbol The R@@ ender , click the tool bar or in the menu view of R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name any name , but useful is a name that can recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size , you can wear the width and height of the rendered picture . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the image section to the ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; in combination field quality you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refle@@ ctions lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the User manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; if a picture is drawn with only a beam as per pixel size , different mistakes can be created . these pictures often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stu@@ cking effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of this error . generally pictures with this feature better .
&quot; if you turn off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects to P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam of pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard , an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is split @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is further split and adap@@ tive because the flow depth is dependent on the calculated colour values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam of pixel . if the difference between the values to the noti@@ fied pixels , if you calculate the value of an additional number of pixels with super sampling , a grid of 4x4 will be calculated , in a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for Red , Green and Blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for Red , Green and Blue of the second pixel . the difference is : &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the values exceeds the given threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel size , which can be tra@@ cked individually and further on further sub@@ division , you can adjust the maximum depth of records . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn j@@ itter@@ ing , changing &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the final setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a very long to calculate a scene with this feature . &quot;
&quot; on this cardboard card , you can adjust if the Alpha @-@ channels are to be calculated using POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays are not an object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window to display the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray player . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu entry file import@@ ing ... and select a file from the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ pin modeling ; not yet support the full command scope of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if the import@@ ing error messages or al@@ um@@ ps occur , a dialogue window shows a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support sour@@ c@@ text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import and write this source between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can pull objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code in the editor , simply mark the source file in the editor and drag him into the object tree . &quot;
with copying and paste in &amp; k@@ pin modeling ; and in your editor you can insert sources for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ pin modeling ; a scene ren@@ ame . usually it is PO@@ V@@ RAY or x @-@ PO@@ V@@ RAY .
&quot; when you click on your own @-@ profile view , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User documentation to the displayed object . put the path to your doc@@ um@@ re@@ tention and version . the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 are supported . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example elevation fl@@ int ) into the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you are in files that are not in the folder the scene , you &apos;ll also have to enter the path to these files here . if a file is used in different ways of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used to display the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the colour of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera @-@ view and in the window type label .
&quot; you can adjust the option of the points to the grid in the context menu of the open @-@ model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ ents and turns . &quot;
&quot; larger scores result in a precise wire model , making a better spring for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the sphere you can set the detailed press for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the High detail loyal for extended projec@@ tions , all wireless model views are further divided if the camera is using extended projec@@ tions . extended projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projec@@ tions . this feature gives a better approach to projec@@ tions , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; when you cross a wall , a wall is mounted behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern with two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross ground , a floor is shown below the objects . the floor is shown in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours . &quot;
if you enable cant@@ or to activate the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method for ren@@ dering scenes you can adjust . the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted . more details about parameters can be found in section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di .
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window direc@@ tives . in section window orders will explain how to create and store window orders . &quot;
the combination field standard window settings : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used the chosen window order at the start of the program .
&quot; the list of t@@ inn@@ ed window direc@@ tives shows all existing window orders . you can add a new arrangement with the button Add , and delete a selected configuration with the button . &quot;
&quot; each window arrangement is identified by name , the name must be unique and must not be empty . &quot;
the list below the name shows all views of the chosen window order . new views can add to the button Add and delete selected views with the button .
&quot; the position of the new window . with New column you will create a new column on the right hand of the available window , with un@@ plug@@ ging the window underneath the available window , with flash@@ cards you will find a flash@@ card , the view not in the main window , but generates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you &apos;ve just installed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and now you want to start without exact knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but easy scene , under beginners : a ball on a plane . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings , before you compl@@ ain that you will receive a black screen as a result . if you are using a 3D program for the first time , you should note these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not adjust the camera , no rules for ren@@ dering is applied , as a result , you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you insert no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will only get a black image . &quot;
if you have installed everything faul@@ t@@ less you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ made window order :
&quot; take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can expect a reasonable presentation of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; they are frequently used to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; B model@@ ed ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then choose the menu entry . so you have a scene without objects . &quot;
the open @-@ side view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular note that in the fourth open @-@ side view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this is the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if they click on it , check the contents of the view properties , in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera can change in view of the camera with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click on the left button and drag him to the desired position . &quot;
&quot; if you press the button on the button or the input button , change the wire model views and the object @-@ tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , you can see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could set a qu@@ ader ( insert end@@ able body tor@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an aw@@ ful method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite level as the floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button on users or the input . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the open @-@ side view also shows the plane , although at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane stretches out to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree exactly , you &apos;ll notice that you can click on the icon + on the object . in this case you can see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will find only the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change also the possible settings in the object characteristics . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the bottom to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just allow you to get some of these parameters . select and adjust the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the bottom to set up its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something unique in the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialogue that you can select how the object should be inserted . please select the object &apos;s object . you can change the name in the object &apos;s image ( name = ground pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button you see how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments indicate a m@@ attes black material because you can check settings for the pig@@ ment . do not always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities , but you are now the easiest . &quot;
&quot; if you do not see any color on Qu@@ ader and sphere , click on the button , and then click on the button . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , these are not the colors that you have expected . here are further settings necessary . in the colour list you have to enter two new attributes . then you can do this entry twice ( you can do this also more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select each color and change the colors in the object of object characteristics : &quot;
this step should already be able to perform as you can easily perform the basic work@@ pieces of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ s. they have already understood . the ball can be just as easy as the floor :
&quot; in the view of the object characteristics , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget the input ) or push the button on the bottom , so the ball would floating above the bottom , as you have moved the floor for a unit down below . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ dering results now a strange result : as already before , the ball @-@ surface looks like a matte black material . put the following step into a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you selected the ball , you can as@@ sign a material now . as already in the floor , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; choose replacement object and change the name for example in the pig@@ ment . Click on the pig@@ ment , then select In@@ scri@@ be and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you may reach more interesting effects , if you take time to set some Finish properties : &quot;
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on App@@ ly or press the input .
&quot; the settings gloss effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : even not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should have a good impression of that , which offers you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have lear@@ nt so much you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is an R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you ra@@ ct a scene ra@@ y@@ tra@@ der , the Ren@@ derer @-@ hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) is reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects are processed in the scene and how atmospheric effects are processed for pixel . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you can see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously every scene you want to be lo@@ oted , some lighting sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . PO@@ V@@ RAY file usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ pin .
&quot; whenever you open a new model or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and will replace the oldest in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you already saved the model , it is saved under the same name . is it a new file , you &apos;ll need to enter a name and a storage space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last stored version . all changes have been dis@@ car@@ ded since last storage .
you can only select this menu entry if you don &apos;t have any changes stored in the scene .
repeat the recently revers@@ ed command . you can only select this menu entry so if you are using editing .
saves the current shut@@ down and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , the keys and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can add or add the default short commands for &amp; k@@ pin models ; add instructions or add new .
opens a dialog to device the tool tool . you can add tool tool@@ bar for &amp; t@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; add commands and remove commands .
&quot; a b@@ ump map is a possibility to differenti@@ ate rough surfaces , without any rib@@ bon on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic bodies are simple geomet@@ rical forms which you can use as a building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens , or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models will continue to give them a more realistic look . &quot;
&quot; texture @-@ Map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , using an image file as color card . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser which you can select images to the display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ k show ; is very simple . the browser lists all files that you can click with the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key Return .
&quot; you can adjust , if any picture should be displayed in your own window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field is highlighted in the right bottom corner . when a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file is highlighted by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; set up in the dialogue - &amp; ku@@ k show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the work@@ ings of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the ke@@ yp@@ h can be specified for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; this is selected , then the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with background colour , you can further adjust below . default is not a full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point activ@@ ates , downloads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already at the next picture in the folder , while you are still looking at the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for sli@@ deshow . &quot;
&quot; with this option , saves &amp; ku@@ k show ; at the end of the last open folder . at the next start window will open &amp; ku@@ k show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; Click on the coloured beams to select a background colour . this is used in order to fill the background of screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , here the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can display &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show , so that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
this option is added to the full screen display for large pictures . this option is switched on as default .
determines whether the sli@@ deshow starts with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the time span between the picture change in sli@@ deshow . to change the value , you can insert a new value into the input field or use the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated as long as it is canc@@ eled by the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
&quot; here , change the keys for the various operating modes of &amp; ku@@ k show ; in the flash@@ cards short command , for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for sub@@ folder and a window for files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short notice .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short notice .
displays th@@ umb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short notice .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor rel@@ ates to the actual size of the image .
increases the picture by 10 % . the factor rel@@ ates to the actual size of the image .
the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ k show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first sign of fil@@ en@@ ame , select which you are looking for . if the file is found , they will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ y photo ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; photo editing based on the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; image processing . &amp; show@@ piece ; is part of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; project .
&amp; Show photo ; is a quick picture editing with some mighty basic tools . you can use it to watch your photos and correc@@ tions and correc@@ tions .
&quot; as the rest of &amp; K@@ DE ; is &amp; show@@ y photo ; an open source project , which means that the user reports to its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&amp; show photo ; makes it as simple as possible mistakes or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , your browser contains a page to reports of problems and wishes . if you use this , your browser gives you a page to reports of problems and wishes . all required information is required to follow your message . &quot;
&amp; show photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means users and developers can help each other . if you are a more common user of &amp; show@@ out photo ; you may want to answer any questions about other users of &amp; show photo ; and hopefully you &apos;ll be able to answer any questions of other users . in this mailing list this language is therefore powerful .
the best start to join &amp; show photo ; to participate is the developer mailing list . guide to the developers &apos; mailing list of &amp; show@@ case photo ; .
&amp; show photo ; try to give you much control over its work processes as possible . there are many options to set the behaviour of the show@@ room photo ; to set up on this settings . you can change between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side .
&quot; in the area of Anim@@ i@@ cht@@ ing In@@ dic@@ ators you can select the color , displayed if the under@@ - or over@@ bel@@ i@@ cht@@ i@@ cht@@ es@@ k@@ ator should view the colors with what you want to display , in contrast . sub@@ jection should display a bright color and over@@ load a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ y photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides you important information and promotions to the selected images . you can also click the same side@@ bar in which you can click on one of the five riders :
&amp; Asc@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that can no longer be sc@@ anned and retri@@ eving .
&amp; Asc@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan and scan images that can not make more images than images and save images and save images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images in front of the store .
you can check the status of your scanner at the s@@ ane project page by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .p@@ l .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; channels ; with the command , l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; can be set in the terminal or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialogue for selecting the scanner is opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner and press OK in order to open the scanner . ab@@ rupt and cancel the scanner ; exit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Asc@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) do not treat these options .
&quot; in order to add a picture , the user can only start a gli@@ can and then start scanning for the final scan . the advance can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the picture better , the user can zo@@ oming in the picture and zo@@ oming from the current selection . it can also set the zoom so that the complete preview can fit into the window . &quot;
&quot; when the picture has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a preview of the Settings window , the image will be displayed in a presentation window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image is stored and lie ? en leads to a demol@@ ition and you will go back into the main window . &quot;
&quot; by the button settings , the ep@@ onymous dialog opens in front of the main window . you can change the main settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can look at the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option does not need to indicate a preview of the user . if this preview of the user doesn &apos;t desired , the option has to be chosen . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the kind such as &amp; channel ; pictures stores . dialog to store for each image , open the dialog before each entry file . if &amp; channel l@@ ite , you will need to save them with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to save without a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines how to save the images stored on the option without any fil@@ en@@ ame , then this file is used as a standard for the dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a pre@@ fix for the images automatically , and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to store . automatically stored picture will get a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix of each time , when a image is stored . the characters # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adapt the image quality to save image quality . if select the image quality , the default value is not used , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; an@@ ite ; manual . the button above starts the K@@ DE about -@@ dialog for &amp; channel ; the button settings will be used to end the dialog for the settings and shots can be used to end .
&quot; an@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane Library , which is used by &amp; channels ; please note : li@@ bs@@ ane is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; used as all other programs key ratios . below you can set up a list of these cuts and function . select a list of these abbrevi@@ ations in the Player window and set the Global ke@@ yst@@ ok button in the Player window and click short commands to set the button .
you may possibly create existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; amar@@ ok ; make your keyboard to the &amp; amar@@ ok ; make your keyboard to the &amp; amar@@ ok ; control centre .
&quot; the D@@ COP @-@ interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP functions from collection , context @-@ brows@@ ers , play@@ list , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ list and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ sharing options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE . Amar@@ ok still has some own command @-@ sharing options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script , whether all required modules are available and use dialog , so the user may not run a script . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ ear@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
&quot; in the scripts scripts / Tem@@ plates , you will find a lot of presentation scripts in many different languages . you can quickly find it as a basis for your own scripts or simply increase the required functions . they will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ COP , you can exchange your scripts data with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should contain any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scri@@ p@@ ting languages enable the execute of external programs and commands . this will usually be called ex@@ ec ( ) . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively simple . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all current scripts . for this reason scri@@ p@@ ting to the standard entry of scripts are running and correspon@@ d@@ ingly to react to events . of course a script may ignore the events if there is no use .
&quot; configure the script , to preview the dialog dialog . if a script is started , Amar@@ a sets the working folder to the folder , where all data should be stored . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is all@@ u@@ ded , the script could now ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP @-@ functions further information on the new piece ( e.g. the met@@ ad@@ ata or the piece length ) . &quot;
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer level between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ize : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title : sub@@ strate the path to the selected files of the play@@ list if a user @-@ defined menu entry can also be transferred to the menu to remove d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script p@@ add@@ lery Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ ap ) .
&quot; before &amp; cat@@ amar@@ an ; finished , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do for example . for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ i script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can also be seen with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ a script script . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension of amar@@ an@@ script . for this reason you should easily ren@@ ame your script packages .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining battery should be not exec@@ utable . use the T@@ sar parameter to get the file &apos;s right : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is finished , you can go up to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang link to the Wik@@ i scripts page of &amp; amar@@ ok . for your entry to K@@ DE @-@ apps you should use the category amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; . &amp; amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music to play@@ list if you need to work through endless menus . you may also look for a very specific titles from thousands in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok , you can find the folder within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you would like to hear ? then the play@@ list Browser making it hard for you . and if the decision is still hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the correct music on certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be able to listen to the most advanced audio @-@ player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ discover your music ! &quot;
&quot; generally , you have to insert the following in the base file of Amar@@ ok @-@ Sour@@ ces to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok for the following : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no difficulty in the compiled case . if you encounter problems , please report this in the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; as most of the applications you can enable or dis@@ able the compilation @-@ to @-@ date with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
&quot; to some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in paragraph system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates deb@@ ug@@ ging icons . you have the choice between yes , no , and full . if you would like to help the development of &amp; amar@@ ok ; you should use full use . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort about the alignment dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various features of &amp; amar@@ ok .
&quot; player window displays the player window in addition to play@@ list , respectively . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window is displayed . &quot;
voting barometer : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar has been compiled . this option switches the experimental function of the voting ometer .
&quot; design full function : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok , compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . thereby , color scheme is modified for the mood barometer . &quot;
download files at the music files : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . if this setting is activated , .@@ mood files stored at the location of the corresponding music files are stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external Browser : lets you choose which browser is required by &amp; amar@@ ok ; it should be started when a browser is needed .
&quot; other brows@@ ers use : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not located in the list . &quot;
&quot; play@@ list when storing , save the current play@@ list automatically at the end of &amp; cat@@ amar@@ l ; turn this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running play@@ list when you don &apos;t want to lose . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , will use &amp; amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of play@@ list . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files are stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep current pieces visible during general change , causes the play@@ lists window to keep / down , in order to keep the running unit always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing your browser to the context @-@ browser , it automatically displays the context @-@ brows@@ ers , once the next piece is all@@ u@@ ded . &quot;
in the section of the image you can adapt &amp; amar@@ ok ; s appearance change . the section is sub @-@ part in three parts .
&quot; in the font section , you can adjust the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; amar@@ ok . otherwise , you can select scripts for the following areas : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context @-@ browser . press on selecting ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of customized color scheme , you can define the Qu@@ al of choice and you can choose your own color scheme . use them for the activated colour range for front and background colour . &quot;
&quot; playing at the start , causes &amp; amar@@ ok ; after the program starts , play automatically with the piece on the spot , with which it has been stopped at the end . &quot;
&quot; set the lower window on on screen display allows you to insert the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can look at the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
&quot; the first option is the font . Click on selecting ... to select from the dialog , to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow can be displayed in the O@@ SD . &quot;
&quot; use your own colors , use the option to adapt the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog to color selection . if Pos@@ ene colors are not activated , the default &amp; K@@ DE colours are used . &quot;
&quot; the display text display shows the text in the O@@ SD . by typ@@ ing plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
the screen is designed for X@@ in@@ ama Us@@ ers . thus you can define the screen of a multi @-@ screen monitor environment the O@@ SD is to be released .
&quot; the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers allow even further adjustment possibilities in this card card . &quot;
the card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; amar@@ l ; search for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , please mark the check boxes in addition to its name . this section also includes check boxes as with the selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folder Brow@@ se : this causes &amp; amar@@ ok ; both the crossing and their sub@@ folder as well as their sub@@ folder as well .
monitor : enables &amp; amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders in changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition there will be an incre@@ mental search to make the necessary changes to your collection .
play@@ lists import : causes &amp; amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collections ( .@@ pl@@ - and .m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will be released later in the play@@ lists browser .
&quot; the part collection database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the combination field drivers can choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another institution is not necessary in the MySQL device . &quot;
&quot; the MySQL device is used to create the database for &amp; amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : is the calcul@@ ator , where the database is accessible via port : is the database name where the database is accessible . &quot;
use us@@ ername : password : to enter the data required for the database .
&quot; the cart@@ on card last@@ .@@ f@@ m uses the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; amar@@ ok , can transmit the names of played pieces on a loaded .@@ f@@ m server and need music recommendations on the current piece . &quot;
&quot; enter your us@@ ername and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send out pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it &amp; amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the pieces on your loaded .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters retri@@ eve : after activation of this setting is retri@@ eved &amp; amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters on each of them played separately . note : you need not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of functions and the gallery with screen photos .
&quot; am@@ aro@@ K only needs the package K@@ deli@@ bs and no further K@@ DE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs contained in it , for example modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as O@@ SD is predic@@ ting that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . so , we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably one of your files will make a bug in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . you can adjust the file to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , and you can also delete the en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated file that caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again . &quot;
&quot; mostly lies that Tag@@ li@@ b is important when reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file system crashing . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; amar@@ ok ; is somewhat mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of you compiled by &amp; amar@@ ok ; used to comp@@ ile libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if B. &amp; amar@@ ok , with GCC 3.@@ 3.x was compiled , then this leads to crash when editing the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE using art@@ s@@ d , then dis@@ able it automatically if in@@ active for ... within the setting of the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
you can also send the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a very frequent crash and you will have a good back@@ trace that the error will be guaranteed .
&quot; this is due to the fact that many program write data as UTF @-@ 8 in Meta @-@ Info , but this is not known as Unicode . the following Perl script controls the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; &quot; -@@ f $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : mp@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : mp@@ li@@ b = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( Rand@@ om mode / repet@@ ition / dynam@@ ical play@@ list ) are always working in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can click on grey and half transparent . please note that in some cases up to three times a symbol must click on a icon until this setting is showing its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ folding symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then please check whether am@@ aro@@ K is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen using the ld@@ d &apos; which cat@@ amar@@ an &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ dic Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that am@@ aro@@ k will find the correct version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are clear by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for the developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not appropriate to seek help . please enter only one error when you find something in the correction of an error in am@@ aro@@ v itself .
after the start of &amp; amar@@ ok ; just a blank play@@ list appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
that &apos;s easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the start window is converted into the statistic window . you can find it under ex@@ tras st@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; the importance of these icons changed to Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are calculated for the assessment by users , while points are calculated automatically . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate the pieces in the play@@ list , the assessment phase must be displayed . Click on the title list of the play@@ list and select column evaluation . you can also use the short commands for Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button on your selection and then select from play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; drag a play@@ lists file with the mouse to the play@@ list and let them fall there , just as you would like to do it with other files . that &apos;s easy : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , right next to the Add @-@ button , you can store the button play@@ list . Click on it . &quot;
probably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS de@@ vel and install &amp; amar@@ ok package ; new . look even to lib@@ visual , this package contains many very beautiful visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the Equali@@ zer can be reached in the context menu ( via the right mouse ) . furthermore , you will find it via the menu bar under ex@@ tras equ@@ ali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; used a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm . as you can see , we support pretty much every possible audio format . G@@ stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; maybe you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be supplied with any MP3 decoder ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , input paste &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device needs to provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously ampli@@ fy audio ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; the issue of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and solution . for G@@ stre@@ amer , you may have to specify another s@@ ink ( for example ) . &quot;
&quot; it does not do so . don &apos;t forget that media need to be de@@ coded . G@@ stre@@ amer reads the best choice if you are looking for a white noise . G@@ stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can spend directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ spre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest priority ( real time pri@@ or@@ ity ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that species @-@ sw@@ addle su@@ id is set : &quot;
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs that can cause stri@@ pped playback . read this bug report . read the Sound @-@ Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can help well .
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead of G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine instead , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less sl@@ ug@@ ging , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; amar@@ ok ; why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . use G@@ ST regi@@ sters to record all G@@ stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C @-@ channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( end up am@@ aro@@ v before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg to download , comp@@ ile and install it . then go to G@@ ST regi@@ sters ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and execute G@@ ST @-@ register once again . then start &amp; amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; please report these under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of proposals / wishes , send them best to our mailing list : amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . in addition , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to your COP , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and execute the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p h@@ ok player play &quot;
this command leaves &amp; amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; amar@@ l ; runs before you go to bed then you will be stopped by the soft tones of music that you have stopped before bed@@ time .
how to find the currently available in &amp; amar@@ ok ; current title if one is on another computer ?
&quot; if a functional SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows : the command gives you interpre@@ t and titles of the running unit : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ us@@ ername amar@@ ok player fiber Pl@@ aying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your us@@ ername with your user name . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA .
&quot; visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; amar@@ ok window ; press down the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer , in an independent , in the size of changing windows . &quot;
&quot; the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + rights Mau@@ le puts a piece in the qu@@ eue position . by pressing the input , the first search results will be played and the search returned . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the play@@ list have tri@@ ck@@ eted functions , but how does it look with the symbol in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , click on the title of a browser window . you can select which browser should be displayed . &quot;
&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of am@@ aro@@ K , the collection database cannot be created and on the console appear many errors . what now ? &quot;
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; amar@@ ok ; doesn &apos;t work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; place the CD , then click on Audio CD &apos;s . it opens up a file browser containing multiple folders . to normal read , change a few pieces and drag them in the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . to automatically add files from the folder mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ str@@ ing@@ List Val@@ ues = query ( Q@@ String ) , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , perfor@@ ated F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( Esc@@ orts String ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this fits the previous assessment with a decl@@ ining value , based on how many times the piece was played . the more the piece has been played , the less influence has every single evaluation on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can insert the review for a piece yourself , by clicking with the right mouse button on a play@@ list in the play@@ list window . then you can click on the evaluation of a piece in the play@@ list , and edit : review by selecting or F2 . you can also change the review in the met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
developers don &apos;t want to inform you when you are to publish a stable version of am@@ aro@@ k . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed date of publication which is not related to the short @-@ term plan of am@@ aro@@ K .
&quot; this is a new function in am@@ aro@@ K , but some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon playing in general settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool bar . choose settings tool@@ bars ... and take the required changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create a own . install this then under am@@ aro@@ K ... set the image context @-@ browser design , click on New Design .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ quest@@ .com ) to avoid difficulty , it was removed . &quot;
&quot; quer@@ or navigation range allows you to monitor monitoring and control of &amp; amar@@ ok , while you are in the Con@@ quer@@ or Brow@@ se . then click Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to the navigation range . click on the button settings ( the top ) and select the drop @-@ down menu Add amar@@ ok . &quot;
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces will be played on an independent server . the service is free and you need only a free user name and password . audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; amar@@ ok .
&quot; if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crash@@ es and caused a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably it was compiled &amp; amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have not compiled x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore it has not compiled the output modules . you have to configure and install &amp; amar@@ ok ; new configure and install .
&quot; now I have &amp; amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules are still not released . and now ? &quot;
&quot; probably use a distribution , which can install the development files separated from the actual program . although G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine de@@ vel . afterwards you have to re@@ comp@@ ile and install x@@ ine . &quot;
I get the error G@@ stre@@ amer Crit@@ ical * * : factory for &apos;@@ Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix this ?

&quot; opens the DVD copy dialog . this also allows you to create copy of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also write a copy of a DVD with the help of copying dialog . furthermore , the target medium has to be large enough to absorb the entire ( video ) data of the source in the original form . &quot;
opens a CD @-@ RW dialog . you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive .
&quot; open the dialog to form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to choose between the writing modes and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; a pre @-@ stell@@ ated CD image is burning . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can now be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not supported yet , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
bur@@ ns a previously installed DVD copy . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
&quot; a previously trained DVD video can be converted . this dialogue window appears normally after reading a DVD in the ingredients , but can also be used stand@@ alone . it contains information about the read video , code settings and even options to change the size and cut black edges . &quot;
shows information about the set medium . these information are displayed in the content view and include properties of the media such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
&quot; displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is crossed , the tool bar is now visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small pl@@ est at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information on the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not connected , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view is on or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is activated , their contents will also be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or dis@@ card of the media . &quot;
&quot; if the contents view goes on or out . the contents view allows the output and drag of files into the project view . the ingredients are also selected to read audi@@ ble audio or video CDs , if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head@@ line turns out in the project view or from . the head@@ line is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view has open projects , it looks pretty pretty and divi@@ des the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialogue window to change the keyboard arrangements for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key order below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup drivers . thereby , the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator rights are needed , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; opening the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . here , general programming settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should function for person@@ alization and fine adjustment of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many others &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more convenient program k@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are crucial in the function range , therefore it is rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial that the accompanying programs will give you . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to be able , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following in the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , all &amp; K@@ DE ; program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ COP @-@ interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD , and further features for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ 2@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ 2@@ d@@ Image ( ) , called &quot; D@@ COP@@ ref ... ) &quot; s native D@@ vd ( ) ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ project method , one gets a D@@ COP @-@ reference to the newly created project : COP@@ ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can create a project about the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to modify the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the top @-@ listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface that is applicable only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; code manager ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String , ) . add@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) , called add@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) , called Pad@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ String : ) . &quot;
&quot; so it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ at@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT / home / tru@@ ff@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; audio @-@ Creator ; is a audio CD ; with him , audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&amp; audi@@ o@@ ster Creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the read of &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ ers that code this WAV files ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) . further Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , this WAV files ( usually one title ) will be compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG files or other formats such as the los@@ s@@ less F@@ LA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , read the &amp; CD ; with cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must now be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ers need to be installed . however , all these programs are not necessary to comp@@ ile any kind of Linux . but if F@@ LA@@ C is not used , the installation is not necessary . &quot;
which code file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compres@@ sing factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy of protected audio CDs ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ster ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read any copy protection , it is not possible to avoid any copy protection . in any case , it is not possible to avoid any copy protection . in any case , it can &apos;t avoid the purchase of copy protection . it is simply avoiding the purchase of copy protected audio CDs ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while keeping only once has to be done ( the setup dialog can be accessed through a suitable configuration ) , the daily use of a &amp; CD will be explained later . this leads ( hopefully ) for the slim approach of the user interface , which you will be proud at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ erer programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc . ) &quot;
can &amp; CD ; you can fet@@ ch information from Free@@ DB from the internet or can work completely without a network but everything is recorded manually .
&quot; this is only a short list of commands of the main window . on the page step for step , you will find further information such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program &apos;s configuration . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB will start on request by CD data according to the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case must first be connected to the Internet . ) &quot;
starts the read and - when a encoder is configured in the tab setting for coding Settings - the encoding was set up .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of the available encoder , so that selecting a different encoder can be read as the standard . it &apos;s too note that the encoder in the tab setting is configured in setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that a file is already selected to code file instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and add . &quot;
&quot; open the alignment dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , p@@ ie@@ p@@ sen ) for programming events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; ) . &quot;
&quot; open the main setting dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ster , with various flash@@ cards ( such as Encoder , for setting up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you must go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ als and compression rates and helps you the right Ko@@ di@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information should be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides F@@ LA@@ C , there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on the psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG the most common . OGG might have a light advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rate ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above that bit rate the differences are less important as both co@@ den@@ ers produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , &apos; lame will still be provided with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high up to very high sound quality ( for high bit@@ rate ) , but compared with OGG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG play@@ lists is present .
&quot; MP3 - If music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 , these devices will mostly support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters to audio quality and resulting comp@@ atri@@ ation rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for additional parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting makes good transparency to most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 up to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of one song . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi@@ fi @-@ stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common Stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of one song . good companion for music by young people , portable devices and car parks . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you definitely want the absolute top quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information , which can be entered manually or by the program automatically via the internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used to create folder and file name to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the code programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the code of the code and these parameters here . the manual or help to the Ko@@ di@@ ers explain the switch to these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the sampling ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are encoded with lame , the switch -@@ tt of lame and the title Param@@ eters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ resc@@ ences ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button designation in the wi@@ z@@ ard ) :
&quot; this is what the Free@@ DB is : a free database where you can download the audio CDs that you can download and enter the information , so that all the other information can be downloaded myself , so that all the other information can be downloaded myself : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal but I ( An@@ m des U@@ e@@ ber@@ th@@ ers : this is the author too ) am not attor@@ ney . however , no one can stop that you will be done by the &amp; CD ; more or less value ; so all information can be done by a bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual , will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; it is active to select a check box ( sending a address ) . in this kind of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the server ( this can only know the programmer , which has reviewed the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; to use Free@@ DB , the ge@@ ographic is needed to use reflection server . this saves bandwidth on the network and compens@@ ates the load between the machines . &quot;
&quot; a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only updates the database . &quot;
which evaluation program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to be more detailed in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to be aware that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not yet .
&quot; to store the output WAV files , the code file can be selected and thus the desired file format can be selected . in the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for audio data ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compres@@ sing for audio data ) can be added to the tab of the code . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to this tab . &quot;
&quot; the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed by the appropriate Linux distribution , before the code can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined code . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are located in the category Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; after installing a code reader , more information about his switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . so &apos; lame &apos; will be replaced by the name of the installed code . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read whether cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio code for your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are installed . that could give a hint on what is wrong . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ proof audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step for example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; did you read the complete manual , everything understood , are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set everything up and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) of 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already on your computer . both programs should be found as a compiled package for your Linux distribution , as it is not completely free software for example . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , whatever you can do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd is and that you have write permission to it ( eg ; by trying to copy anything inside the Con@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ resc@@ ein , something which is probably done only once and &quot;
the second section describes the approach to read a &amp; CD ; which must be repeated for each lo@@ ad@@ ress &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
&quot; here we determine the code for compression of music ( lame ) and audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with that you can use Free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change with any &amp; CD ; if once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name will be handed over to the reading program that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your running . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is provided , a view into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the present entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the General Settings card . here you can do not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be left / entered the screen photo . &quot;
&quot; if you have to ask un@@ complete information , so that you will be informed when you are given to the testimony of sampling ( tags ) . &quot;
the card CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet of a Free@@ DB computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; connected to the internet to access the Free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second sel@@ ective box is easier , an &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately the read of the &amp; CD ; which is later un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting folders / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory entry or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you would like to manually insert everything manually . however , if you want to download it manually , you can be able to use Free@@ DB locally on offline mode if you need to be able to use Free@@ DB in the offline mode , so the two select fields will need to be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card . &quot;
CD@@ DB is provided for us Free@@ DB . this is att@@ itudes to the Internet &apos;s data request for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB server through the Internet . how does the system that want to get the CD ? read the section via Free@@ DB . put it all as it is displayed in the screen photo .
mode : we don &apos;t have downloaded the database but we want to work only with the remote database on the Internet server .
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the site fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org , looking for a mirror server in your area . however , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both do not work equivalent to the server , but there are many Fire@@ walls the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf in the internet . &quot;
in this example we don &apos;t want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to the Free@@ DB server . the first check box should be dis@@ able .
simply take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is used on your computer )
&quot; number of excluded pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author does not know , therefore just try . &quot;
CD ; to read out of the last piece : cross this on the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you need this switch , then the path / folders can be specified in which the WAV files can be specified . if only space is installed on another drive , the file can &apos;t be connected , if you want to do something with WAV files . &quot;
&quot; everything just as it is on the screenshot . the command is a bit long , under circumstances must be da@@ zz@@ ling to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting rate factor is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
&quot; note the entry &quot; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &quot; for the constra@@ int of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted as required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the names of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) . &quot;
set the rest as in the screen photo . some comments for future use outside this sample :
number of simultaneous WAV files : using a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
&quot; that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ster ; this configuration is used as a standard for each evaluation of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; in this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard drive , we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , as we want to pick up into the hard disk , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data is described in this section , must be repeated for each al@@ able &amp; CD ; to be repeated . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD , the screen photos are not included in Free@@ DB , see screen photos a little differently than those for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; comments should be hin@@ dered on the differences . &quot;
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example is to find . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD will now have to be defined in the drive , which was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen photo . this is only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
if this is not happening then you are looking for the questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by Free@@ DB , all titles are already completed and are displayed in the name of the artist and the album . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; gives a window appears , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best to your &amp; CD ; fits your opinion . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have selected the check box for the automatic cancellation of Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can manually select this by choice of the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have any local database but the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 2 : the CD Editor - input of CD data and title of the first piece
specify the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Update &apos; title &apos; the rest of the data on the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
&quot; the artist does not need to be entered in the &apos; Update Title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments ini@@ que per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments together for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from Free@@ DB is not empty , but it contains already the data as in the following screen photo . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor or not only ... ) but also to check whether there are any undes@@ ired notes . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limit the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and titles of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set to enter the code settings . &quot;
you can change the tag information of the generated files anytime with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files and you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
&quot; tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ ers and file formats . see the help of the Ko@@ di@@ erer , in order to obtain more information . &quot;
&quot; simply select one entry , obviously with the style of the selected CD ; matches . in this example , this is not important as we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example , find under Rock . &quot;
after the election of &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second one .
&quot; the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album is already filled with the set data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the current piece in any case and other information you want . &quot;
Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the cover dates of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from Free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected or selected . make sure that all pieces are selected or put the button to select the bottom edge of the screen to select all pieces at one time .
&quot; by clicking on the button selection out of the reading process , this window appears to be confirmation . Click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the essays and track what is going on . &quot;
&quot; Click on the tab to switch on the job window . it is in the left top half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program will be shown in the left bottom part of the window at the status bar .
this error message you can see if you are trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ ver that you haven &apos;t yet installed . pieces that are not successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the list list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folders are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have a write access to the temporary files and the target folders ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus you can read and en@@ code parallel . notice the status message at the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and de@@ code . in case of powerful machines , the use is un@@ clear . the used machines with an am@@ d@@ 64 seems to have no problem at the same time reading and en@@ code ( of however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is encoded with a third order in the qu@@ eue of the Ko@@ di@@ zer . after the last piece is encoded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left of the window . &quot;
&quot; for successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ resc@@ ein , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x. or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is maintained today within the &amp; K@@ DE ; CV@@ S as part of the case @-@ cultiv@@ able media package . however , if you already have a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ resc@@ ein . most distri@@ butions do already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ resc@@ ein . if you read this , you probably have done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to people who comp@@ ile source files , and not intended for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help looking for your needs , if it is running once , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; one program that calls for many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step for example to get the options and settings . it displays screen photos of various flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still at read ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first time of the program , without any reference point what to pass on from this somehow empty display ( especially when the program starts with no audio CD ; in the drive is found ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it ? if you read this , probably the program has already started . it should look somehow like this : &quot;
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can not reck@@ on this manual . it &apos;s as the first version for a manual on &amp; kiss . it is thought to have something useful or change it . at least not only after contact with the author . and if you read this he has to agree with this proposal .
&quot; strange if it has been able to get the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - und Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ an of &amp; K@@ DE ; besides others , he did not have some properties with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real @-@ show texts that do not have other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system and should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; K@@ DE ; support work . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver supported for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is involved as soon as it supports a Sequ@@ en@@ zer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the song on the screen with changing colour so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of each MIDI channel activity through high@@ lighting the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so you can use in &amp; K@@ DE ; each MIDI file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; Windows can move to K@@ Mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( rec@@ ti@@ ques or tex@@ tures ) . K@@ mid obtained the procedure automatically .
&quot; meeting support . if you finish &amp; K@@ DE , while playing a song by playing , K@@ mid will start with the same song again next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first you can select ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you choose your desired song . &quot;
you can also add a file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window to drop . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and reset the button to play in the tool bar , select the entry to play from the menu item or touch the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you pull it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows . ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then play down one another . )
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the kno@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or slow down , you can click on the arrows and to the right of the Tem@@ plate . to get the original pace , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ plate . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button pause or select the menu order break in the menu , so interrup@@ ts play . put the space bar while playing , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
song texts can be stored on two types in a music piece . some pieces use text event ; others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are supposed to be displayed and even better : the event type will automatically be selected , so you don &apos;t need to adjust the kar@@ aoke text , so you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up an event type , select from the menu settings the entries of tex@@ tual events or rec@@ ti@@ ques . the same feature also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summar@@ ize . these are played by the series . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . in these , you will find in the menu collection below the point , click here to New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
&quot; if you have more than a collection , you can set up the program you want . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when applying this application , this collection is not stored . if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , you have to add to the collection manager . there you can add to the button Add a song . in turn , it appears to select a song with which help you choose your desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song , depends on the setting automatic adding to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic add to the collection , one piece is automatically added to the active collection ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must select the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on the removal . &quot;
&quot; you can select the sequence in which the songs can be played . if you select the series after the sub@@ menu match of the menus , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or select random order in the menu , the order is set new . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collector manager or use the select list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu , or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song , select the button previous piece , the entry predic@@ table piece from the menu , or press the arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button to delete a collection . &quot;
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter if it is not stored on the leaving of &amp; k@@ mid ; it is not stored . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events translated into events which understands syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map that conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always lets the trumpet sound when originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the respective file from hand ( with your favorite dit@@ or ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that saves all the required changes for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . requirement is that each appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further Key@@ map ... &quot; End De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... End options ... End
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and end , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your Map file as e @-@ mail , so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices which are not general MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the patches of General MIDI is displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign will be ignored . it is believed that the GM patches are in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument supports , on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can define a drum for example ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which is similar to a tissue surplus . for this purpose , use the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( a tissue shooting ) , it takes a patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of what tone is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the concept drum patch of the patch is meant , with which any sound represents a different per@@ cus instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the clay is the pitch of the same drum ( as some keyboards have ) . &quot;
KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to indicate how tones are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important as well as its presence . so you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several Key@@ maps for every channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first row .
&quot; in particular , Key@@ maps are used mainly to form tones on the Per@@ k@@ ah channel . check out as an example the supplied keyboard maps . &quot;
&quot; this section can be used to exchange some channels on others . if you want to change the first and second channel , simply make it easy at the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; n is part of the channel , which is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , you will need to change the key@@ map with the name name for this channel ! if you are using the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , then always Patch x is used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the Per@@ k@@ ite patch on the per@@ k@@ ite channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio , in which proportion of Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multiplied , if a MIDI file is converted with the value n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) , and then it will be for@@ warded with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then the value of 40@@ 96 is used to be found in the Map file . &quot;
this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard that should be playing a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately some keyboards around two sounds can be played higher . to try the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use an MIDI @-@ map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
&quot; the Kan@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole series of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ vi@@ atures , you see what sounds just played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a select list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed a instrument , the button doesn &apos;t use any more green but red , to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
&quot; the channel view ( now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . the view from the Settings menu , select the Settings menu : settings &quot;
&quot; the pace @-@ LCD displays the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the temp@@ o of a song . so , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played . it contains the scores , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . so that I can perform the same MIDI file on two different devices at very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same scores in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can force ni@@ em@@ it to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file requires a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this may happen if you compiled a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support has been compiled . to solve the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; understood , that is , supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
specify advance the setting of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files are added to temporary collection .
you can click on the arrow keys to slow down the Tem@@ plate . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on one &amp; K@@ DE ; Desktop - &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; open windows with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a Karaoke file ) or delete a file ( if I want to play a Karaoke file ) just into the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; windows and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file just once , without them to add a collection , turn the automatic switch to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection of added files &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. listen@@ er just want to play the first file . so , set the automatic switch to the collection and open it exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then , join B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to play and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ? &quot;
these people have sent MIDI files or postcards . thank you ! if I see these songs or see the postcard animated me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; too .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment , I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment , I &apos;m trying to take a little time for my Hob@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to collect MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where you can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an expansion of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rac@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make me a giant of giant , if you send me a postcard from your place or a Mi@@ di@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you would like to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will receive a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to contact me , since I already have the file . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid , completely written in my spare time and gets no eman@@ cip@@ ation of money . I therefore want to mention that I will only get more pro@@ gram@@ er because / if I receive feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Bü@@ hler - Keep the error that the pitch was high at AW@@ E cards .
&quot; my thanks also applies to Jose L@@ us Sanchez , for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Garcia for the testing of AW@@ E support , Peter Gr@@ itsch , Magnus Pep@@ per , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Magnus Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch to notify me an error , or also only a supp@@ or@@ tive e @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; and of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians in the net , which give us this wonderful Mi@@ di@@ - and kar@@ aoke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also on his website can be found , which can be found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rac@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . you will find the development along with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you could have a sound card except that you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if difficulties pers@@ ist , contact one of the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ player , phon@@ o and FF@@ m@@ peg . the program will be used to play video files that supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD , VCD or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; my name ; was not yet finished as &amp; K@@ DE ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions or send the question to The &amp; K@@ DE ; User mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . there is an information window that will only be displayed if information is displayed in it .
&quot; it is possible to retri@@ eve the preferred connections under the menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should use the permanent play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional Hier@@ archy . if you have a entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category , and playback will begin with the adjusted entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent play@@ list can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do when editing and / k@@ m@@ player / , you can also choose from an editor , and then click on a name of a category . Click on the click of a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu must be selected from the menu and select either process mode , or select another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes are lost , when the processing mode leave or select another group without balance the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; following the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on using the XML configuration files . &quot;
the animation at Star@@ ts and Be@@ end can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c and change of &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; if the option is not available , it can be inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / credit / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at Star@@ ts don &apos;t need to be short , it will automatically end through the opening of another source . this would be an end to the end @-@ animation , but the user can finish the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be an advertisement of your favorite photos : &amp; lt ; ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G dur = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f = &quot; file ; / some examples of S@@ MIL die of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; supported . &quot;
&quot; there is a rider for configur@@ ing M@@ players in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here , the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the intermediate storage size from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this release device in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured manually with manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ amp@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module is played :
Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field Em@@ bed for YouTube in play@@ list XML .
&quot; so the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module has to be specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the dialog box assignment . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; used in a consol@@ es application and search for error messages concerning the shop of the browser module library . if no error occurred , the baking output within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; so there is always a given back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type ( of course , only if this is also determined ) , this must be done with manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be played by TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked , the scanner can be configured manually or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog can be used in the settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be Ports which have to be selected ( e.g. , it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably contains a DVB t therein . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support can only use X@@ Video , the X@@ Video should work only ( probably this kind of play@@ able video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also necessary to use the video servers only on the first screen ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; intern@@ ally , both names are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources of different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , d@@ v@@ d@@ nav@@ source , source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ d@@ ull , t@@ v@@ source , source source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the play@@ list . &quot;
are there instructions like I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter if I play from it ( not of the VCD / / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is run as a user root after the insert of the device . it is absolutely sure to make that / dev / c@@ drom is pointing to the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user interfaces and network support and is required to comp@@ ile and ile .
&quot; lat@@ ex ; : a professional script application . under Unix @-@ like systems , probably on the package &amp; texts live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) . &quot;
&quot; most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution included . for installation , the documentation of the distribution and installation disc should be attracted to / DVD . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable a simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - ir@@ respective of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions about this project should be taken into account . if the support for this project or documentation is desired , the contact via the k@@ ile ; website should be produced . &quot;
get questions about or at the compilation of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or any extensions desired this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; functional area . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to complete , comp@@ iling and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; the ability to complete , comp@@ iling and trou@@ bles@@ hooting within the source codes and transformation tools for this . in addition , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; Kate , and its possibilities was to learn the manual for Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can begin with the chapter of &amp; Kate &apos;s works directly with the editor of &amp; Kate . &quot;
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TEC@@ H is easy to use is also a La@@ ie ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ macro@@ s can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic dimension is that it may be taken from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
&quot; here , there is only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book to do it . for &amp; lat@@ ex ; right to be able , good conditions such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Us@@ ers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the same as other extension languages , includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction that can be specified as paper size , side number@@ ing and text file , with the command \ \ \ &apos; class , which starts with the command \ \ &apos; { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ \ { document } . &quot;
the rapid @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a great feature for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the document ( menu ) can also be made available to the document @-@ related settings .
&quot; document classes : this will hereby referred to the type of presentation document : article ( article &#93; , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ m &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom &#93; . &quot;
encoding : this is the character encoding . it should be used to use the encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most common @-@ used package for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration you can only apply only in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( subject to compliance with German DIN standard ) . they should always be used in creating German text . &quot;
new users now don &apos;t have to worry about . this is simply a brief description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just like other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; you should have a simple way to find out that some mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it will result by the modest appearance of output file . however , it saves you through the high@@ lighting time and increase . &quot;
&quot; to enter a new command ( e.g. \ \ $ { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a space line ( e.g. \ \ \ \ { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu ( e.g. \ \ \ { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings . &quot; &quot; La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; encour@@ agement the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the h@@ ott@@ est and sub@@ jective element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in structural view , each individual elements can be changed and viewed on the respective single mou@@ sec@@ lick . &quot;
&quot; for creating the own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; ger@@ ent &#93; file format was created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer at the respective line at the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format document and also other information such as the font , and is in addition to PDF the full output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the edges , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file is spec@@ ulated with the editor , the exact opposite section is spec@@ ulated in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source : once upon a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source file is spec@@ ulated at the appropriate place in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
Master @-@ Document : this function will be used in working with multiple files . with a Master document the work with other integrated .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide Master document can be set up .
quick : the lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code ) .
&quot; file monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ file will be over@@ grown , and there is no use of &amp; Ok@@ epi@@ ece ; according to the quick building . &quot;
&quot; considering the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large @-@ scale selection fields should be developed for the quick setup of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the quick breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex commands are : &quot;
&quot; the selection field further is available for articles such as tags , fu@@ sions , notes , or references . the options are available : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a description for section , image or other element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection for a selection box ) .
using quot@@ ation a select list with literary entries are displayed . at &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; this only works if the file is required for a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; b ; the author can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; written by hand .
&quot; the last radio box with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¶ e is used for the resolution of font size . it can be used to describe the font , the fox notes , etc . , the following font size will be available : &quot;
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two com@@ bat@@ ches are available : 1 . the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document and of the settings . 2 . the document may be written with the hand .
&quot; the bra@@ ckets on the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font name . if the font screen is not fixed , it can also happen in text . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the above source code was entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to this is the use of men@@ ding , or the button of button . &quot;
the source code must be saved before the compilation . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
&quot; if the compilation of the document should be sought after errors , in the log@@ ging it should be searched for the errors . if this is not the case , the log@@ ging should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; a environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the font size will have created a different font . the command \ \ \ { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ \ \ { environment } . &quot;
the changes will only be careful within the area ( from \ \ } { environment } to \ \ ( { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the change within a environment .
&quot; there are many attractions to increase the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain font , fat pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. are added . these commands can be added either with the \ \ &apos; command or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ $ { recep@@ h } : this command is suitable for the course of a spa pressure and is closed as long as it is closed with a \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; or another environment . a single word can be recur@@ sively represented with \ \ recep@@ h { Word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ menti@@ ons { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ &apos; { quota } .
&quot; after the background to the writing of the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; drawing language is shown , now follows a step @-@ in @-@ step instructions for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; once in the wi@@ z@@ ard , a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . at this reason a quot@@ ation , a few places in fat and cran@@ c pressure and a poem is used to view the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , the editor &apos;s view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( at an external viewer ) . when an external viewer must be closed . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
DVI ; the file format is a wide file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi edition such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF @-@ converting or computer screen umbre@@ llas . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed using a file printing ( in the viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool bar per@@ ch the conversion of DVI ; -@@ file in other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source file , the conversion can begin to reverse other formats with the volume P@@ FE in the tool bar . &quot;
the privileg@@ es encour@@ ages direct jump from the editor to the same position within the DVI ; file .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; Bin@@ h files . for this , only modern under settings can be set up ... tools B@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; to find out the preliminary search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in one line of the source code and join the step @-@ search , the leap to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer takes place . &quot;
this function in &amp; Ok@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; open and at the appropriate row . this needs to set &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; Ok@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ... editor )
&quot; if using the Quick Construction of &amp; DVI ; viewer can &apos;t handle , an error can be fixed . if there should be an error , this is summar@@ izing in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file extension refers to the source source in the source code . in the editor you can click on the Error List , in which the error appears . to look at error in the error , the error in error must be cli@@ cked and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to the error line . &quot;
&quot; once on the appropriate button in the tool bar , a window to choose from the presentation of the document is displayed on the document . the pre @-@ set documentation are : &quot;
&quot; when choosing an empty document , a document may be written either from the reason or the wi@@ z@@ ard to the rapid creation of a new document . more information can be included in the section . &quot;
&quot; he@@ dged users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be created or created a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by means of an existing document and choice of file template . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , some character chains can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in settings in settings . &quot;
&quot; in order to create your own presentation , it is therefore necessary to know which character strings of which variables are replaced : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by input in document class . typically , they will be used as follows : \ \ &apos; class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { items } . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wi@@ z@@ ard and the associated entry in the editor . once the document has been created , the following steps have been accomplished : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , its own presentation can be assessed instead of the standard@@ . &quot;
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be created . a simple way to create a template should be looked after one in the internet and can be folded under the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and her@@ b@@ ulation of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be done in the menu tools right from &amp; k@@ ile ; out .
for more about &amp; Kate ; and his comra@@ des could learn the manual on Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can you start there directly with reading the chapter of &amp; Kate ; begin playing with the editor of &amp; Kate .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be called for the menu help La@@ Te@@ X reference , which allows for almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use them as well as their syntax . &quot;
a double @-@ click on the C@@ tr@@ l button to cut the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ .
&quot; when pulling the text , the printed text is copied automatically into the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys , parts of the source file can be used in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the opportunity to search for the most diverse types of source codes and emphas@@ ize it . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex commands are different from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ as are emphas@@ ized by another colour . &quot;
&quot; a lot of wi@@ z@@ ard dies . this is an own way of book@@ marks within the text . the menu option is highlighted in the text or the appropriate button to jump , so that it is automatically issued on the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; the work is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; even though &amp; Kate ; outstanding features , have been added to &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; important functions for their selection . under sub@@ missions are the following commands for the text code : &quot;
&quot; there is a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing on both sides an empty line ) . this extended meaning cl@@ asp the tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . thus , the only preventive cause can be separated by two empty rows . &quot;
&quot; there is also the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also an extended meaning , since this command also commands the lat@@ ex ( \ \ ) and a separate star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to listen to a document of the document , of course , it can be removed and remove by pressing the key . &amp; Kate ; offers the key@@ note C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the following commands to remove the text of the text : &quot;
&quot; remove a complete paragraph . the definition of a ship@@ ments in &amp; k@@ ile , is contained in the description of editing the ship@@ ments . &quot;
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; this is why &amp; k@@ ile ; for some additional commands under the work area for a large simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
&quot; with this command , at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the command to the outside the environment . &quot;
&quot; with this command , at the end of the current surroundings ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the area . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor before or within the command \ \ menti@@ ons { Sur@@ ro@@ undings } , is spec@@ ulated at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the input of many cas@@ u@@ ded environmental commands , the preferred view can be lost quickly . this command will close the last environment , so that the f@@ iller structure will not be broken . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by bra@@ ckets { ... } . under the work Te@@ X group are some important commands that meet from editing environment .
&quot; with this command , at the beginning of the current group spec@@ ulations ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the soft cl@@ amp . &quot;
&quot; with this command , at the end of the current group spec@@ ulations ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the dra@@ fting bracket . &quot;
if the cur@@ sor before or behind the wheat bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # is located to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; in the input of many f@@ aked groups of bra@@ ckets , the preferred islands can be lost quickly . this command will close the last group so that the scra@@ per structure of the &amp; tex ; group will not be broken . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two basic applications are used as a grid solution . for the purpose of the application , the sign will be used . &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign will be used for two easy access signs . &quot;
this automatic set @-@ up for double application character can be set under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X - and to be trained .
&quot; it can also be used as well as specific settings ( e.g. n@@ ett@@ or French ) , and thus German or French land@@ marks . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; at the push @-@ off of Shift ; In@@ puts it &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is within a lists of environment ( e.g. breaks or it@@ em@@ ize ) , feature &amp; k@@ ile ; not only a line breaks but at the same time the command \ \ item also . &quot;
&quot; within a tables &apos; environment , &apos; t &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close turn of line breaks off . &quot;
&quot; even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ washed &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments , can be set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added . &quot;
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables and to arrange all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other , trying to encourage this . although this tab@@ ulator is unable to convert &amp; k@@ ile ; according to the most common tab , add &amp; k@@ ile ; some intermediate space allow for the current Tab@@ ul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; though &amp; Kate , already offers a good source of source , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( usually for the lat@@ ex ; ) are still existing , and the other two are suitable for automatic loading positions . all these modes are used to allow different ways under settings . &quot;
in the beginning a new environment will be added with the command \ \ \ { surroundings } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically added the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; by pressing the press bar , the last letter of the input will be removed and m@@ oo@@ red the link list . on the other hand , the list can also shr@@ ink with another letter as well . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions become visible by selecting a command . alternatively , jumps from &amp; k@@ ile ; also jumps to these positions by means of Edit Spr@@ ung@@ stamps N@@ Ã ¤ ste jumping brand , and the perceived parameters can be preserved . &quot;
&quot; using co@@ ile , set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings on these lists can be done . you can catch different W@@ Ã ¨ res for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as regeneration of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is ready for the completion of environments . there is always a few letters with \ \ &apos; be entered and the call for completion mode is used to result in a large number list with environmental commands . on the other hand , the environments become so often used to ensure that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the implementation of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the process mode , the menu has been automatically split or the key Alt + Shift key space , the order to change the environment will continue automatically and it appears as \ \ Tell . after that , the environment may continue to finish in the easiest way and can be done by pressing the input bar . &quot;
&quot; after this is accomplished , the area becomes automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; knows that it is a list of lists , even a first \ \ item command is frozen . &quot;
&quot; using co@@ aches , set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings on these lists . this mode uses the list of completion of the full @-@ time mode for &amp; tex ; - and lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; supports user @-@ defined list of ab@@ dic@@ ed lists , which will be replaced immediately by l@@ n@@ g@@ ere strings . as an example of a drop list , the ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl file serves as an example of the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the Word play@@ able mode has been replaced , the letter L will be replaced by the code \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large amounts not helpful . however , it was found that many of them can be written in a document more than once . that provides &amp; k@@ ile ; the completion of this is already written . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set in the volume settings K@@ ile ... ile failure . here , the swelling can be specified for the display of completion . &quot;
&quot; the file size files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / the pers@@ ist home folder . mode is available for use ( devi@@ ation ) , and tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog contains the creation of graphics as simple as possible . in view of the basics , the basics of the graphic formats should be considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for change and re@@ direc@@ tives of pages . the PDF edition is required , then you can download the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are arranged and then with ps@@ 2@@ pdf converted into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to fill the result of the work , you need to comp@@ ile the source code . all devices are group@@ ed to Cre@@ ate Cre@@ ate Cre@@ ate Cre@@ ating and Cre@@ ate view . &quot;
&quot; for the comp@@ iling of the source code as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used by Alt ; 2 ; later , the DVI ; -@@ file converted to a PS file converted to a PS file , and by using Alt ; 5 the PS file can be considered . &quot;
&quot; when using the command signal , a viewer is usually called for the compilation . if no internal viewer should be used , each time a new window will be used . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the project new project .... By the following information we asked for the project :
when used the file name -@@ window must be the relative path of the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows you to manage EC@@ MAS@@ cript coding Co@@ de . scripts can be managed by scripts in the vertical lending .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; still .
&quot; first , first must be said that the exit environment of scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods : &quot;
&quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite elabor@@ ated system , in which the basic functions are expanded by a variety of multiple packages to be extended . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides a lot of different help to support the user . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; lyrics ; are supplied with many documents . this includes a documentation for the contained packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; a fully functional Re@@ ho@@ z for &amp; tex ; and there is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a fully operating instruction manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; but rather , it is a very large document that is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; because of the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / texts live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy ; the small application of tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; supplied documents and here for a graphical surface area . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories , and the great advantage is the search for package names or whi@@ ps . of &amp; k@@ ile ; only the results are displayed . &quot;
double @-@ click on the mouse or the subject of space bar you can read the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source text editor , which can be combined on all systems with installed &amp; K@@ DE ; - and Unix ; also available on &amp; Mac ; also installed on &amp; Mac ; installed with installed OS X . &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who continue to sacrifice for the development of the &amp; k@@ ile ; project , and offer for many hours on the development of tools that we can use all the contemp@@ t of the &amp; GNU / GNU / license page . you can use information about the contributions . &quot;

&quot; version 3.2 of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; . all of these tools are used as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
everyone who has worked with the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentary has been working on pro@@ c and how over@@ h@@ aul@@ ing it is . we need it a piece to give it a graphical interface ! no longer need to go on a terminal ; simply click the icon for the XML processor and finished !
&quot; this application is based on a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is attached to the current working folder . if not , then remove the current working folder and give it to the required folders in the field of other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time if supposed .
&quot; as already said , anyone who has worked on the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation has already worked , white , how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; now there is a great graphic surface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the straight @-@ opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then they can simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and give it to the folder , where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to a display on the screen , your file is er@@ ron@@ eous . please check the reported errors and try it again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already highlighted in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; then let &apos;s simply delete the current file . if not , delete it in current file the skins and select the file to edit the file and select file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ called well @-@ called file is well , you can click on the Well @-@ label review . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; DT@@ D file ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , choose &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) , and enter the place of the &amp; DT@@ D ; file selection . both for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG review is the definition of definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has an &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if you have already selected the file in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then let &apos;s simply select the current file . if not , remove the current file and select the file from the file selected file . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should have named , the file is normally stored in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ in , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have to do with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; even though , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . in this way , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can &apos;t wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; quantitative information ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used . &quot;
&quot; to install a Plug@@ in or K@@ Part , we begin with the plug @-@ ins . so the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
this dialogue allows to manage all plug@@ ins available and add new . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ ELE@@ MENT in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ in without a location is used &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in .
many people often work in a type hier@@ arch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves for unique identification .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as sub @-@ project manager . &quot;
the user can look for yourself from the list of te@@ amm@@ ates who it is . this happens by sending the team member from the list and pressing the button . currently the selected member ( your identification ) appears bold after which you are : text .
nickname and attitude of your own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for further information about comments .
&quot; in addition to an overview of your team there is another advantage of the members of the team : it can be created an event to the team leader , if something specific is happening . see further information in further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed if something specific is happening in the project . an example would be able to draw up the opening and closing of the project , leaving a message when a file is assured , or a script that will be added to the CV@@ S as soon as they will be added to the project , etc . &quot;
&quot; on the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , it can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the addresses selected in the recipient . the add@@ res@@ is can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see in which such ladder can be set up .
comments are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
insert notes is simple . it can be selected either the note record from the editor menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a commentary text followed by reading text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a determin@@ ant member of the team . in this case , the syntax of the team member states , the nickname is the nickname : team leader , Sub@@ project leader Sub@@ project leaders , should be led to the lens or sub @-@ project leaders such as in the examples below . &quot;
nickname and roles names are independent of wholesale or small sh@@ orts but spaces around the stap@@ les and the cl@@ as@@ ps are invali@@ d .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scri@@ p@@ ting and form@@ att@@ ing languages that supports DT@@ D ag@@ nost@@ ic and web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing and script languages .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; specific settings are treated , a short description of which can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be called by att@@ anta using the settings of Qu@@ anta . the dialog covers a number of pages which are treated to each other .
the behaviour of &amp; quantitative information ; concerning tags including car completion may be modified . the entries are :
&quot; large / Klein@@ sch@@ reibung of tags : large / small scale of tags automatically added to tags . normal big / small notes , tags are as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / Klein@@ sch@@ reibung of attributes : large / small figure from automatically added attributes . normal big / small @-@ description means , the attributes are as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if adjusted , for tags , for which the exclusive day is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; no optional tags automatically include : as top for all other tags , except the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; start and end @-@ up day automatically update : when switched on , the appropriate closing day will be performed and vice versa . &quot;
automated acquisition of accent : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in appropriate coding during enem@@ a .
M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to identify various types of files . once again the default settings can be restored .
standard character encoding : encoding the encoding of newly created or in other way as with file open @-@ open files ( where the encoding of the file can be translated ) . but this setting is checked out of the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files that DT@@ D is not recognized . but this setting is checked out of the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regularly backup copy , so that with a power loss or crash when next start of the program can restore the document of this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . even for any stored documents a backup is created regularly , according to the set time . &quot;
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or an own view ( or the documentation in a box ) which makes it possible to look the documentation and the source code at the same time .
&quot; set the window settings on the standard back at the next start is useful when the user interface comes through changes of M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters . &quot;
the warning messages is provided with the tax of possibility to dis@@ able war@@ nings from war@@ nings by non @-@ more in@@ quiries .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the indication of icons instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source @-@ view in the shared mode . with respect to different modes .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the figure of par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , may be dis@@ continued in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure @-@ tree , the following action is possible to change the mouse button by clicking the mouse button . &quot;
in the structure of structure settings the visibility of no@@ des in tree that will be automatically opened on the tree and how deep in a change the structure will be opened automatically . empty knots are empty areas in the text and empty groups are found in which there is no element found in the current document .
&quot; the area to set abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) that can be un@@ folded when working on a larger text . abbrevi@@ ations , it can be valid for several &amp; DT@@ EP ; this means that it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ ice does not mean anything else than in a group valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript . &quot;
&quot; plug@@ ins can be administ@@ rated in the plug @-@ ins . plug @-@ ins are the third site , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part application , the most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; in the inser@@ tion of a plug @-@ in must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to plug@@ in if there is not at a stand there as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is given to the Plug@@ in when starting , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check whether the plug @-@ in is denied . only @-@ read @-@ K@@ Parts refuse to load the store , if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the Plug@@ in : is this activated , then test &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the given information is correct . if the input is not available , if the plug @-@ in is not available , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting was completely developed . Die@@ ug@@ ger was set completely new , as well as the support for the d@@ b@@ g de@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bug plug@@ in concept was implemented , which enables various implem@@ ent@@ ations via plug@@ ins . &quot;
currently a Plug@@ in is available that adds support for the use of &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert .
&quot; the use of the deb@@ ug@@ gers for a project starts with selecting a matching de@@ bug plug@@ ins in the repository settings . with the button options next to the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in selection field , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a deb@@ ug@@ ger is activated , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface : &quot;
&quot; a view in which the contents of supervised variables is displayed , appears normally in the left do@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed , appears normally in the lower Do@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; a view in which the output ( like in HTML ) of the deb@@ ug@@ gers is shown , appears normally in the lower Do@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the deb@@ ug@@ gers , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action is connected to the deb@@ ug@@ ger , if necessary , produced , or it shares the Plug@@ in with plug@@ ging on debit requirements . this action is fired by default when a project is opened , that will not be considered in the normal case . &quot;
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session Start the session . closes the connection to deb@@ ug@@ ger or termin@@ ates the l@@ ashing according to requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to look at the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
&quot; comm@@ itting the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script and the updated variables as well as the updated line running . if this happens , the execution phase is continued , the execution phase will start . if this happens , the script will start with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; comm@@ itting the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script , without information to super@@ vis@@ ing variables and the current line number . if this happens , the execution phase goes further . if this happens , the execution phase begins once a requirement is made . &quot;
&quot; the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next directive in the script , without going into the functions or includes . &quot;
&quot; the deb@@ ug@@ ger performs the next directive in the script , whereby when possible in functions and includes instruction . &quot;
&quot; comm@@ its deb@@ ug@@ ger to leave the instruction and go to the next so , as if the current is not . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialogue with which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the surveillance value seems to be monitored in the variation view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable . &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; front @-@ end and a K@@ DE from x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that it can be found at htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many more works of Keith .
this chapter describes how to custom@@ ize &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; can help to become better .
documentation : editing packages ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quantitative information ; to provide support for market and scri@@ p@@ ting languages and &amp; CSS ; their simplicity and flexibility makes it easier &amp; user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the market up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; . &amp; DT@@ EP ; s are hand @-@ oriented bodies of image buttons ( above the edit window ) , the text and instructions can insert faster into a document than a user ever could . &quot;
&quot; DT@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; DT@@ EP ; &quot;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ h@@ c ; file contains the rules and information on the &amp; DT@@ EP ; file contains the rules and information on the &amp; DT@@ EP ; itself . tool@@ bars allow quick inser@@ tion tags to a document without any risk of a writing defect .
&quot; day folders are nothing than folders . they contain only the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the names of the write language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML , declared whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better viewing and more information in working with them . &quot;
&quot; the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations are laid in simple manner . &quot;
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document , but it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains only one element type above themselves . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid for class type class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
valid only for Type Method . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; yes , if yes , the day has an common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
&quot; set a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag , this is an only element element . &quot;
&quot; describes an attribute of an tags . this item can only happen once for every attribute . it contains the name and the type of attribute . additionally , there is another tags that should describe as this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc . this is a only element element . &quot;
&quot; speci@@ fies the source code for the attributes in tag editor , and in the attribute tree &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; will be used to meet the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a inter@@ section and a method@@ ology . the arguments that can be handed to the method . can be empty or per cent daily , that means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container day group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only occur for an attribute description . it is an only element type element .
&quot; speci@@ fies the attribute texts of an tags within a dialogue . this day can only happen for every attribute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) , the element is empty . &quot;
is the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be available for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the final tags . this item is an only element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; Declaration : &amp; lt ; XML version = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be dis@@ closed and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools will start the dialog in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to boot and checked Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions will follow . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , verification only occurs when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; in the following an example for a family 1 day XML file , this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; ELE@@ MENT from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; diagram . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; in the following an example for a functional family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; transfer function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; function = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; option = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; option = &quot; string &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; type = &quot;
&quot; the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is as simple , and there is an editor that can be handled via DT@@ D edit DT@@ D settings . this can be edited via DT@@ D edit DT@@ D ; for a list of selected &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; General &#93; Version = uses 1 for &amp; quantitative information ; version &amp; lt ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( -@@ / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname . &quot;
a action can define the action with settings ... created . Click on New action to the same dialog :
&quot; in accordance with the button &apos; button , the button &apos; button &apos; button can be assigned to a ke@@ yp@@ assing button ; you can remove the current button . &quot;
the sim@@ pl@@ est promotions . it can be entered into a text in the detection settings and inserted into this text in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action external applications ( usually scripts but it is not limited ) to change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick launch dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML DT@@ EPs .
first the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ on variable in command line like sh % scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh@@ anta / scripts in the following locations : $ P@@ AT@@ H / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
&quot; % f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file is removed : / from the document names . &quot;
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the ongoing &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus process ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control the control of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the external script is used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document , or path to the repository file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the enum@@ er@@ ated methods described above , a script exec@@ utions of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus can be determined by default . in the selection field input can be determined , which can be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected field of document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally sensible with this setting .
&quot; according to the input can also be re@@ directed the output of the executed application . there are two types of output : normal output , written on the standard output ; error messages that should be written on the default output , by default value is set by default : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool bar . in a given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool bar with the name of the marker . &quot;
&quot; once a tool bar is added , you need to add actions and configure . select settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are fairly self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New action button at the bottom end of the window will start the Edit mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add it to the appropriate tool bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the day attributes , and you are planning to set up your use , dis@@ able the dialog &quot; Day , &quot; when available , a input when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ug@@ ly symbol . who should note the action in connection with this icon ? will we replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; menu ; , graph other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution centre ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol will not only help you , to remember what the action does , but also to all other users in the &amp; DT@@ EP . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by the use of green ( green will usually be sign@@ aled ) , or should at least , a message to the user , click on it ; -@@ day in the current document will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this happens to the menu with att@@ itudes ... ( in &amp; quant@@ um lus ; ) and selection of the required action . in addition to the text field there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder , in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the user button and put it out with other tags , so there are , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
assuming you want to add some usual &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for tool@@ bar and it should set this for a better overview by some separ@@ ator in several groups . make sure that the desired tool bar is selected .
&quot; I would like to choose the Tren@@ ner ( top left ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element , the tool bar should be added , press the arrow keys to the right . this adds the element to tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to add a quick way to access the trans@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the separ@@ ator support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; button the opposite of the start button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool bar must be tested by checking all symbols , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; in the correct folder . after new@@ ly@@ XML does not exist , there will be im@@ bal folders , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please watch out your tool bar ( s ) if a file is open at the appropriate folder . &quot;
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for normal users the ability to like documentation for the script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language which you like to like . this is why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; -@@ document tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , check out the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory whether somebody has done for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you have to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; language . then you have to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we have to give you the second part we handle here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c thee = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for example , ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for those document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Section Section 1 = .@@ html Section 2 = # 1 html # 2 = # 1 html tag@@ 1 = # 2 html @-@ 3 = day 2 html &quot;
&quot; the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so somewhat : &quot;
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c thee = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 N@@ etting Start@@ ed = Introduction : ... Introduction = Colle@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax = basic syntax = basic syntax = basic ...
note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . that shows that there are sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the box office ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out .
note that the contents of the table is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and it is evident at the top end of the building view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is shown ! ) .
space characters influence nothing but watch out &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resour@@ c@@ end@@ points .
&quot; the contents section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which should be displayed to the design of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array function would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separated text elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c and get to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / goo@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / goo@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as if you do this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth to be divided , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation has been used to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for the use by the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Community . they will not be rich , but proud to be with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ating resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources may be sent via email to friends , partners or anything else . at different places there is an email send menu entry , as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , tool@@ bars tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions will be reviewed and only available if our team needs them as correct and usable for the release , for example , if our team needs them as properly and usable for the release , for our team as well as for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) or in the case you have several key , you can click on the input fields . in the dialog New resource , you can click on the input fields below ) and click OK to upload the upload . &quot;
&quot; upload the pole DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) to upload utility tool bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts are to be started . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , investigated &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by exam@@ ining the integrity and the significance . if the integrity is given and the resource can be broken correctly . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the statement of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work with XML @-@ languages which is currently not created by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is currently supported by using a DT@@ EP package . however , the preparation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files can be converted into a DT@@ EP package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D store and conver@@ ge of DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with DT@@ D description , which should be used afterwards . after that , the following dialog appears : &quot;
objective name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / d@@ te@@ p file .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition line : the string that appears in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Tag like HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d should be released
&quot; DT@@ EP after conversion : if activated , provides &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are several key concepts . in order to understand these concepts and full benefit from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore , one must first understand these concepts about these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; little use is needed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , the working range is divided into three areas : global , local and project management . this distinction affects a series of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; available , available . from tool@@ bars on actions is everything that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; quantitative information ; this enables the group of administ@@ rators different tool@@ bars , promotions and patterns in the global tree which will then be available in a multi @-@ user environment at the system . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be used within a particular project . this can be done with special promotions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns within the project em@@ o@@ gli@@ cht . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ or@@ window , the architectural views , the assembly lines with information and the tool@@ bars . please strike in , and for further information related to these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the Cart@@ a button with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as close to current , other or any cart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter , re@@ load or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right hand @-@ click in the Edit@@ or@@ area lead to another context menu on the processed document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / insert ) , editing the file below the mouse poin@@ ter or open the file when the string is named under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editor there are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional is shown as standard for which a set of tools will be shown . in the course of further development of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and thus connected user requirements . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert into a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; you want to insert into your document , then click on the icon representing several attributes ( such as weigh anchor ) , you can add several attributes ( such as weigh anchor ) , you can insert several fields in a dialog . &quot;
&quot; the construction projects ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and to pass through . in the representation of mapping modules , project , sample boards , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; provide all the files on the project , allowing you to manage files in the project by right mou@@ sec@@ lick . actions such as adding , removal , upload or delete the files from the memory medium can be done with the displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . all possibilities are open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which context them are used . the category depends on the &amp; quantitative information ; global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the respective users and templates . more to templates are available . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of incorpor@@ ation in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can also edit the information available to a script . the right mouse button are available , such as the script , edit or send your email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , the internal structure of the active document indicates the cur@@ sor in the document on the position of the element . by right click of an element , the cur@@ sor is open to a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ h of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among other construction projects . with it , some attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace can change . the modification of all available attributes can be cli@@ cks with few cli@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . it can be downloaded for documentation documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided by the quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ ons at the bottom end of the window can be reached via the beneficial information : the message window and the problem @-@ window . &quot;
this cardboard box displays information about each in the Qu@@ anta running script . for example the DT@@ D of the current document and any changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
&quot; this cardboard box shows all the mistakes in the Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; quantitative information ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and you &apos;ll get the corresponding command . the chocolate @-@ manual page of the tool@@ bars is the option to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with email . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , sends the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar Archive via &amp; mail ; . if you receive a tool bar in an email , they can save them in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; as any other secure and load ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . in order to get a complete list of options , which can be transferred to the configure script . to understand a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
if you have problems with Star@@ ts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin Fol@@ der . you should ensure that there is no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimised for a rapid web development and combined with a large variety of functions .
&quot; during effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what would be if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , ext@@ end@@ able market @-@ up language editor would be ? well , this would be an absolutely great web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; it should be defined &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore , the appropriate &amp; IDE ; &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; Develop@@ er is not only this possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore , it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore , as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web development to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this may increase productivity . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , it can be able to mem@@ ori@@ ze it by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars . ( more about it can be found in . ) &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ anta , Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and has quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta . the original developer left the GP@@ L @-@ cen@@ sored version and produced a commercial program .
more in detailed documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL into &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; enter or help@@ full center help : / qu@@ anta exec@@ uting ) .

&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file that is not on it , whereby the oldest record is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later use , check in the section above templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template . &quot;
&quot; converted to insert from the clip@@ board there , special characters for &amp; HTML ; verify that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as form@@ att@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; note , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day . &quot;
&quot; switches the block selection , or from . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; touch . &quot;
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if you &amp; PHP ; script error messages are available !
search for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
shows the message box or not . that &apos;s the window where you see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
evaluation and en@@ roll@@ out of the problem business on the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem is activated once you change to the structure tree .
shows the tool@@ bar left from the main window . this column allows you to re@@ mark your book@@ marks with a mou@@ sec@@ lick .
&quot; when book@@ marks in the current file , you will appear in the menu together with entries from previous or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sors . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
a existing project from the hard disk . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects will be saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presenting a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searched the project directory for new files that might be there . this enables , e.g. graphics files into your project folder or a sub@@ folder , and then add it to the project . &quot;
download the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; as well as if you have another input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects can be found in detail . &quot;
loading a project tool bar . these are kept in projec@@ tors / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool bar . that creates only the name . actions must be saved by settings actions , or you will be asked to check the tool@@ bars , whether you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; remove a tool bar from the visible range . delete it from the hard disk . if you don &apos;t delete the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do this . &quot;
&quot; to send your own tool bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so the tool@@ bar will be present in the next release ) . the menu option opens a new email message with the tool bar . &quot;
allows to upload tool@@ bars on the main server where any other can access it .
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; you or someone else has made and convert into the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description section .
loading / ch@@ auff@@ eur of de@@ ities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; DT@@ EP ; to renew them without the whole &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this global is not present and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file does not fail to fail .
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags which are available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is an menu menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day installation dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;

&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu points . click to click on the plug @-@ in plug . &quot;
select the syn@@ tax@@ able mode for the current file . the list of available openings schem@@ atics depends on the canc@@ els ; -@@ version .

&quot; immediate change@@ over between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the change@@ over may sometimes need time or in@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the cart@@ el mode , which is also the default setting in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu for each open window has an entry . with selection of application , the corresponding sub@@ window is activated . &quot;
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window frames respectively .
&quot; the changes in this dialogue needs any application to use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web brows@@ ers . &quot;
editing the behavior of the Edit@@ ors . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you can delete entries from the tool or add the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should produce a help according to the mouse environment , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free , but as in any open source project , developers can always use aid . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top of the project , for example , after filling the project , the whole directory structure for the rest of the project automatically complet@@ es . all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is automatically filled . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces in the expansion web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory . &quot;
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine to which one wants to access , one , except one worked out local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examples ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if one can empty this field empty , the default settings of the chosen log can be used . depending on the remote user setting , an adaptation may be needed . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set to the standards . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , in which the tool@@ bars for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set to the standards . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . several files or whole folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you want to download and change the static web@@ content you want to download and change . in case of server scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; let me leave , if files that are located somewhere in the main file of the project , should be integrated . if a project of reason is started ane@@ w , not an@@ ha@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders will be displayed inside the main player and you can make a precise selection of good colour . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want , or , by removing the skins , clips from the project . &quot;
&quot; the last screen of the new project wi@@ z@@ ard contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . this settings can be handled in the menu features for project properties in the sub@@ window profiles , or with the ke@@ yp@@ h Shift ; F@@ 7 . &quot;
some settings correspond to those in the project wi@@ z@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) which are re@@ located in project related operations like the project folder .
&quot; supplem@@ entary option for up , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which will be loaded with opening the project , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to select the desired de@@ bug . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed is found in . the deb@@ ug@@ ger Plug@@ in can be set with the button options . in the deb@@ ug@@ ging , deb@@ ug@@ ging is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as the display of a supervision for the contents of the server for each profile , by poin@@ ter a separate supervision for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see for details . &quot;
&quot; in the event of event configuration , one can switch the event actions and add these actions to change or delete attempts . event actions are executed once a particular event occurs , such as the sigh@@ ting of a file . see in details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project , which was opened . currently , you can not influence this behavior . &quot;
&quot; to open a different project , select the project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool bar . the dialog Project will open and allows you to choose a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pri@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically stored . you will be asked whether you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project management gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , but if you are able to open and open the opening menu with the right mouse button . &quot;
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information on the site of the highly added files . see .
&quot; allows the removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent removing the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be kept in the core memory and forget the program . this possibility is useful if frequent high load of files is necessary , and the rather uns@@ afe password will save on the disk -@@ option not in question . &quot;
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ loads profiles are created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to various servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears : &quot;
this is the name of the server that will be copied onto the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE , and the installed Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally this must not be changed , except the network administrator runs a service to the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it in your discretion . password will be stored on the plate , so that it can not be easily read , but everyone can see with programming skills it can easily be seen in the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be placed in a project many views , that is , by simply plug@@ ging of the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored in the Menu project or the Project tool bar , accessible via settings Tool@@ ing Project tool bar , opened or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this does not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quantitative information ; to their own work mode . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; best on the menu tool can be fixed . use and adding itself . adding tool support is treated below in section adding of tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; tool@@ bars and symbols can be set on either via context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action is created , you can adjust other actions such as tool bar , tool bar ren@@ aming or tool@@ bars , which can be specified in the dialog where can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool bar , additionally the entries will remove and action shown that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and setting up actions .
&quot; templates are created in the main document , code sni@@ p and files to link . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; templates are basically like a common file system with extended organisation and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any of the system available in the storage space in the storage space . in such templates are templates for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified in the beginning of each template .
&quot; binary is all that is not pure text . it can be added any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . bin@@ aries will be placed in storage space under global templates . further information regarding templates are available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be made by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , specialized documents can be found in corresponding sub@@ folders . a few examples can be found under global templates . see in for more information on the templates . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not to be inserted a new document based on a template but the same text area to be inserted back to a complete menu system on Jav@@ as@@ cript , or Perl based . some examples are in the storage room under global templates . see in for more information on the templates . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , this templates are used for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents that can be arranged in a folder set , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar Archive . there are currently no examples in &amp; quant@@ um lus ; . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure for popularity ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select file as template as local template ... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the repository . look at the storage room under project management . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document , and click on file as a local / project template . alternatively , the choice may be dra@@ gged along with pulling and drag to the size view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file into a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as pulling and dismant@@ ling or insert over the file tree of Con@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder or in the project files building view to a folder on the right and secure site template , but of course it can be saved as local or global presentation . &quot;
&quot; project managers allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can make head@@ lines and foot@@ er , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , files , or to link with them . additionally , you can keep some things using templates in projects very profound in the eye . &quot;
the pre@@ m@@ enstru@@ al structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files purchased in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Tem@@ plates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Tem@@ plate / Tem@@ plate / Tem@@ plate / Tem@@ plate / Tem@@ plate / Tem@@ plates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as described above .
&quot; to determine the behavior of a folder , in the template overview , you can click on the folder and select the context menu features , the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a sel@@ ective box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as ter@@ restrial attributes is inherited . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits for everything except the regular folders . if a regular folders would be set to dis@@ able unless they would be explicitly enabled , in the case of a normal folder the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text @-@ structures . if nothing appears , you probably find in a trunk folder . &quot;
permitted or re@@ listed text for templates in this folder . this may be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and enables copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ er .
&quot; in addition , you have the context menu ( pointing to the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quantitative information ; two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor , which can be reached via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the second will divide the editor @-@ Editor into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor is as follows : it invites you a document such as a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and reset the source code , in which the required changes in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document , the &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ en@@ nig of &amp; PHP ; source file . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor to edit &amp; PHP ; there is no plans to change this behavi@@ oral pattern . &quot;
&quot; the second mode is exactly like the first , except that simultaneously changes the changes in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor is syn@@ ch@@ ron in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor input is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ck is able to maintain the active cur@@ sor from a window to others , whereby the position is maintained in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . in addition , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation can be set automatically . in general , the recommendation can be set automatically and a large range for slow hosts . &quot;
suppose you want to change the title of the web page so the documentation of invisible tags is possible . this is also called the processing of invisible tags in work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is used to change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document even e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows you to change the content name and keywords keyword keywords in the column name and keywords keyword .
&quot; CSS rules are the new path to design the presentation of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list , or delete a change on the list is exactly as the met@@ a @-@ elements is currently not supported . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to involve an external CSS style template by pressing the button , and select the corresponding file . &quot;
&quot; the cur@@ sor is used as in a word processing , through evidence of arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor is pec@@ uli@@ ar . the markings works as usual . text can be inserted into the type and be deleted by plug@@ ging or distance button . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags is made in the same way through the tool@@ bars as in the source file , so that the inser@@ tion of tags should not be removed from existing identical tags , e.g. , if an anchor day is inserted , any other ro@@ unding anchor must be removed . &quot;
some tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the lists of lists are disabled . you will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will be used in this release the tables or lists tool@@ bars .
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the analysis of styles . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for specific elements is possible and the style of style can be followed . &quot;
&quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compiled , need except &amp; K@@ DE ; the libraries lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t , li@@ be@@ x@@ sl@@ t and lib@@ x@@ ml ; which are available at a typical installation of &amp; K@@ DE ; already available . &quot;
&quot; in a template , in one place in one of x@@ t@@ ld@@ b@@ g invited stil@@ - or x@@ ml file or at the current no@@ des . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db device mode , the ai@@ ste gri@@ ps can be set in a specific file and line number . &quot;
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without arrows . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top charged style file names with rel@@ ativ@@ um to working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is for example a Stil@@ me@@ tic file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ db is the following input possible :
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete compliance with a pre@@ age called the QNAP ME or a specified module name is checked . &amp; eg ; template wins with each QNAP ME , which contains the template chain template . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; &quot; F@@ ME &quot; &quot; will be added after the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace specified in the X@@ SL : test@@ 1 &amp; eg ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / trans@@ forms : test@@ 1 &quot;
a sought hold on hold must be dissolved in the respective UR@@ I and line number . this will be automatically re@@ checked when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each flow .

there are many graphical tools for the same . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the posts made many changes and at the same time he had corrected much changes at the same time . another programm@@ ers had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was a large number of conflicts .
&quot; the program used by me was shown only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within this lines . and there was no evidence in the places where perhaps only the impression was changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 was added ; however , differences were added to a line and modifications to white characters . later , some more useful features were added later . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you would like to compare the text , you simply copy it into the clip@@ board and add it in one of the compar@@ ative window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
&quot; also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful if two people work independent from each other in one piece of co@@ de and changes to changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . this editor shows three Qu@@ ell files at the same time : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the compar@@ isons and merge file . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; with folder mer@@ ging :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the precise differences , and the possibilities of current colour monitors . if you frequently need code @-@ monitors , you will like this function . &quot;
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters you can see that at a glance at the Sum@@ mary in the column on the left side . ( no anger more if no one changes the entry . )
&quot; when a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates that file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can simpli@@ fy the ti@@ p@@ par@@ work by simply writing the file names in the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; photo folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder , diff@@ 3 folder , diff@@ 3 folder , folder 2 folder 3 folder 2 folder 3 folder &quot;
&quot; the opening dialog allows the manual of fil@@ en@@ ame file names , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or select one last file from the open@@ er list . you do not specify a third file ; if you have to leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences with two files will be done . &quot;
&quot; in the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons and co@@ aches of folders will be selected , for B and C , but uses a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file names from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merge is working , the input field is active for target and can process itself . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately notice an output file immediately . you can also do this step further when saving . &quot;
the set button opens a dialog with settings . here you can define the options before you start with the compar@@ isons / merge .
&quot; sometimes you do not want to compare all the file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board into the active compar@@ ative window . compared begins , you can &apos;t select files easily with the break @-@ button . &quot;
you can also use drag and drag : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let him fall over a compar@@ ative window .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you would like to figure out what these functions are , it would be quite a great effort . you would need to copy only two corresponding files , then compare and compare it to the relevant sections . &quot;
note : currently you can do nothing of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 . only the drop of text in a compar@@ ative window is supported .
warning : some editors will interpre@@ t the draw and drag text into another program as cutting and inser@@ tion ( instead of copying and inser@@ tion ) . in such a case your original data may be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional ) , leave the mouse to a while above the line . then you will see a small relief window to the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three sources are assigned the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this default settings can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is detected , one sees in the color that distingu@@ ishes itself . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . colour scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) well . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the text , the summar@@ izing column is found . if differences were found , the color indicates the appropriate color . in some programming languages , the colour is not so important , it is useful only to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white characters are relevant only in strings and commentary , for the processor and in a few , rare cases relevant . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the summary column from the text , is interrupted in places where the respective source file is not enabled . if the line breaks is activated , the line is shown to broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the comparison list ) also has a info line with the inscription output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Change &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! till all the conflicts have been dissolved is the Save Off ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the top dissolved / un@@ solved conflict in order to find out the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ isons members are used , each difference is also to be replaced by the manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window , the group &apos;s first group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this is also the first group of the group will not be visible . ) This group is then emphas@@ ized with the color background colour for the current sector and each on the left will be a black beams . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , by automatic merge or manual editing there is no further line left in the group ; then it is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you can change your opinion , and perhaps again choose another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marker you may want to copy and elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; conception is required , but appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy these text from the back window . go carefully with this feature . &quot;
&quot; note : if the sources select the options to ignore or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated as white signs . &quot;
&quot; this will navigate mainly with the picture run and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are using in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys to the right , side down , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ beginning and C@@ tr@@ l @-@ end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . you can also click on navigate to navigate . &quot;
in the eye window you can also use the other buttons to work . with the inser@@ tion button you can switch between insert and over@@ clock mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
&quot; one click on the left mouse button in one of the combination @-@ columns , the view of all windows are synchron@@ ized at the beginning of the respective group ( as stated in the context and the ed@@ itable exit window ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / former conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture above ) or the next / former conflict in conflict . therefore , the conflicts has to be solved as a conflict . therefore , the conflicts has to be distinguished between dissolved and un@@ solved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marker into the clip@@ board , you &apos;ll have to copy the copy kno@@ b ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l In@@ sert ) . if this is enabled , you will automatically mark the clip@@ board , and the manual copy fails . be careful with this option , as you could accid@@ entally write the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line @-@ up are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . UNIX variants are using a row @-@ in @-@ lane \ \ \ \ \ \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the line @-@ up of the source files with \ \ \ \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the line @-@ up of the source files not , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of the last used files are automatically stored and returned at the next start . ( menu setting un@@ gen@@ - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; select a let@@ tering with firm width . ( on some systems the dialog can also be selected with variable width , but you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences are shown in ital@@ ic Scri@@ ptures . if the chosen script does not support this representation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered power@@ fully automatically . on these systems , the button settings will automatically display an un@@ just color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , when pressing the tab@@ ulator button , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted . otherwise , a tab character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you enter or press Return , the submission of the previous line will be automatically used for the next row . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , every selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . manual copy into the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ende type you prefer to store . the default value is commonly used in the operating system used .
&quot; during the compar@@ isons of files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all complete identical lines into the source file . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . in this step , white signs will not be ignored . even when mer@@ ging white signs are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car @-@ back sign &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others turn back only a row @-@ line feed &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the car @-@ back sign , but then could not be treated with different sizes in the side @-@ to @-@ side comparison , but then this option may be disabled . in default , this option is de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; the default setting is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; -@@ &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; -@@ &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
inten@@ sively search for smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files but slow to very large files .
&quot; automatic @-@ jump mode determines this setting , as long as the result of selecting is displayed , before the next un@@ ting conflict will continue . &quot;
solves automatically dis@@ solves all conflicts in white signs by selecting the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if you need only conflicts of time in numbers or comments if the options are ignored in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or ignore Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in chapter to scanning the folders and execute mer@@ ging . check for details below document@@ ing a directory and comparison .
&quot; if a file is stored and there is already an older version , the original version is called Su@@ ff@@ ix . original is required . if already a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ conf exists , this will be deleted without any additional backup . &quot;
&quot; the language of the user interface does not fit the current running program . you must finish and restart the current running program . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is dis@@ continued over the control centre there . ) &quot;
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry , if you use this option , the top setting is used for all entries . &quot;
about the selection fields for encoding appears a short notice which is local code . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has a purely inform@@ al character here . )
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences such as special characters treats and re@@ interpre@@ t . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , you can compare files with different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have processed a file , you can define the coding to store . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( e.g. , your files should be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option can set the encoding of output commands . &quot;
&quot; turn off this to supp@@ ress the settings of changes in text or consider@@ ations . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are ignor@@ ing or ignore Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is available only if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may see only the differences between two of three files . according to selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is not displayed next to the standard . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; submit the compar@@ ative window to each other , or ski@@ p each other . this may also be useful for viewing of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot;
&quot; sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge into the merge menu , even if you compare only two files . a simple click will start the merge file as default for output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge file , then the name of the recently used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it will be handed over to this external command first . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor , which is exactly your own assignment . you can use this function for example to un@@ cut un@@ disturbed parts or . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be handed over to this external command first . if a normal pre@@ fabri@@ cation command is specified ( see above ) , then the command of command is only used at the line of command , which corresponds to your own processor . each input line has to have an appropriate issue line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to enable more flexibility when setting the sealing results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l fully sufficient . &quot;
&quot; in this context , use this pre@@ fabri@@ cation command for the input in capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;@@ S / \ \ U \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s text chain refers to the found text in the first cl@@ ung . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper case letters . &quot;
&quot; * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you may be able to understand it and perhaps do you like this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre@@ fabri@@ cation process for line @-@ off suitable suitable for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ normal@@ ities . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so basically deleted . &quot;
sometimes you may want to perform several objectives at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; to separate the lines from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / Switch / switch &quot; However , per@@ l only needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data according to normal pre@@ processor are maintained for display and merge . further operations change only the data indicating the line @-@ down @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; note : in rare cases , when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ down pre@@ processor see the output of normal Pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful but , as with any function , the text changes or differences , you can accid@@ entally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and get a complete folder . &quot;
... &quot; making a proposal for each object ; you can adapt the proposal before starting , &quot;
... can sim@@ ulate the co@@ sim@@ ulate and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without it really perform ;
... select selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) .
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and co@@ aches of individual files . you have to specify only folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three file is merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target file is specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folders . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not the merge . to select the merge button , select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you are informed a little news window about the current progress . if you break the scan of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared until then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
any file and any folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mou@@ sec@@ lick .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right . open the directory menu with which you can open all sub@@ directories and fold all sub@@ directories .
&quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison begins and it appears a compar@@ ative window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folder , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case the merge action cannot be chosen automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about this type of problems . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , columns A / B / C are used in columns A / B / C colours red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; however , in identical entries the colour is identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
ste@@ wards are considered identical as the identical content is identical . then the folder also have the same color . with folders that age is in@@ significant for its color .
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colours reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red is red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C identical but not B : copy from B ( or if B does not exist , del@@ eting the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , del@@ eting the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , del@@ eting the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same data type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such in@@ correct objects , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. , A folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such in@@ correct objects , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode to synchron@@ ize is active if only two folders and no more explic@@ it target folders were provided , and if the directories are synchron@@ izing , then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is to be identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : mer@@ ging and save the result in both folders . ( the user looks as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for output file only B ; directly after the merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders will be merged and select the new file instead of merge ( un@@ safe ) , then exam@@ ines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files are different , but the date is identical , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange may not be eliminated , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during the merge , one file is working according to the other . status column shows Fer@@ tig on if the merger has been successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected is completed , you should make a final review and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; when in alignment dialogue the file compar@@ ative method of Full Analysis is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or collected . ) &quot;
you can select either the just selected entry ( file or O@@ dner ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all inter@@ connection actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) you can start the merge .
&quot; please note : if you have not specified any target folder , then in the three @-@ folder merge mode C will be used as the target and synchron@@ izing A and / or B as target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the target folder , even in the folder structure , there are some options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directories and continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the ke@@ yst@@ er@@ zel ) . in order to execute the current record or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if contradic@@ tory data types still exist in@@ invali@@ d actions , a message appears to appear on the defective elements . you can then select a valid action . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options , sim@@ ulating and break . &quot;
select Sim@@ ul@@ ses if you want to see what would happen if you really want to do any changes . you will receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual operation is necessary ( summar@@ ize a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( notice the screen photo ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select another directory and proceed or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; continues to work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , there will be a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some errors that will help you to select the problem of the problem . so you have the opportunity to try to select another action for the entry or to continue the problem in any way you proceed with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were put together individually , not@@ ices &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries are not together ( in the current session ) and leads them to the later merge together . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped , these entries will be dealt with . only if you merge into action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
&quot; now , the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called a directory with these options : &quot;
only files that fit to the specified pattern are displayed in the Element@@ baum . several samples can be entered . separate plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . file does not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the Element@@ baum . it can be entered into elementary @-@ tree ; use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the Element@@ baum . it can be entered into elementary @-@ tree ; use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
ignored files that will also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mat@@ ically produced files are ignored by CV@@ S . the major advantage is that this file is specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a specified attribute . in other file systems a specified point system is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the Element@@ tree or not . this option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to the links below . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links how normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sive . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ) will not run on possible rec@@ olle@@ ctions and crash@@ es on itself . ( see that this option is switched off . ) This option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; a complete analysis of each file carries out and shows statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ folding , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when they are applied to files that do not contain any text . ( specify a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare great folder via a slow network , it may be faster to compare the change date and the file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of safety . please use with caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to confidenti@@ ality date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical , if it is equal to us if copying the alter@@ ation date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ize mode if two folders are compared , and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging files are identical . also , the results from the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copy of the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , as it is assumed that the other file is not changed . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder is replaced or deleted by another file , then the original version is renamed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file is already deleted , this will also be deleted without additional backup . this also applies to normal recording , not only the mer@@ ging whole folder . this option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge doesn &apos;t remain visible . you can turn the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can turn the window directory and text window to divide the main window in the window menu and switching between the two views between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file via double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry into the directory menu . as soon as you save the folder , the status will be done directly , and the file will not be group@@ ed together when you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote computers . &quot;
&quot; the first command line is compar@@ es a local file with one FTP server . the second command line resem@@ bles a folder within a compressed archive file with a local folder . &quot;
&quot; a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should you consider : &quot;
a path can be relatively large or .. contain . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls . these are always absolute .
&quot; special characters need to be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty draw &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol , it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
or it can &apos;t be drawn whether a link should be displayed on a file or a folder . then a file will always be accepted as a link . ( FTP : FTP ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change of change . the per@@ missions or change of change from the original . ( note the option of confidence in size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose @-@ purpose is currently being the differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts to start in the built @-@ in differences of K@@ Diff@@ 3 . press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then choose In K@@ Diff@@ 3 Part from the context menu .
&quot; normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as K@@ Part , takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file doesn &apos;t exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch starts to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work when any of the original files exists . also , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since production of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is performed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge is not supported in K@@ Part mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is com@@ pare ) there are already . additionally the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge together as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I use GP@@ L programs very long and have lear@@ nt a lot when I saw in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all those who have gone this way or so go .
&quot; you probably have compiled the program from the sources and to configure the correct PRE@@ F@@ IX to K@@ DE . in default , K@@ DE cannot find resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you can find more detailed information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , only a non @-@ white character is treated differently , the line will be treated as not identical . i@@ F similar , next to Each , this is , but this figure is more than the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor indicates every difference in the files where it starts and ends where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as text file and it &apos;s too much effort to design an own file format , that could save this information . &quot;
the effort for it was so far too big . you can always restore any specific version by choosing a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text should be used .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; published and the text can &apos;t be extingu@@ ished . what does it mean , and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to lift off differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
a list of the last changes you can find under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ ic or in the Ch@@ angel@@ ica file in the Qu@@ ell package .

&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . should still difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists . &quot;
cut them into the clip@@ board ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift ) into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . insert the text from the clip@@ board on the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current mark .
&quot; show differences : files that are identical in all folders , and therefore not in folder structure , and therefore not in target folders . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you have to restart the folder with the function Update . ) &quot;
&quot; there are only entries to show the differences . this also does not contain identical files when the merge doesn &apos;t contain these files . if the target file does not already contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( behavior may probably be switched off in a later program version . ) This option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose from the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines of the selected group will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) , when the lines are already available , click the button accordingly . &quot;
the default setting is de@@ activated . under@@ go in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature preview of all virtual desktop space . it is quite convenient to see the ongoing programs on the working areas to stop it or post@@ p@@ one it . this works both within a working area than even at several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual desktop space as well as to display applications . applications can be selected and even moving on the desktop and to another .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , window within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved . the movement is possible both within a working area and other working areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; it is cli@@ cked , the context menu can only set up the two entries of p@@ ager ... and end . if , however , the context of the application as well as entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , working area and end . the commands are following : &quot;
&quot; maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . only , when it was cli@@ cked on an application . &quot;
&quot; sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only , when it was cli@@ cked on an application . &quot;
&quot; this check@@ box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved in the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the virtual machine name is displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual machines . together with name , it is provided with name , will have the names with ordin@@ ate numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . working area . &quot;
&quot; if this field has been crossed , the background is displayed as a background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its standard icon and pixel map shows a small view of the real program window . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very quick systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main focus can be determined : classic leaves &amp; c@@ p@@ ager ; in some other window managers are known ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual machine surfaces in a horizontal row and vertically in a vertical range , which is very good for viewing side on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ ature program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can display in size , display windows , or with their content and move it outside the control bar . &quot;
Click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent removal of switch switches ... lets the dialog appear .
at the moment this can not be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do this manually :

&amp; k@@ may ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding around new functions . it is optimised for use on powerful machines .
if you &amp; k@@ may ; launch a window as above . the main window of &amp; k@@ may ; displays the enlarged section of the screen . in the following this window is displayed as an enlargement window . in the following this window is described as a magni@@ fying window . in the following is an enlarged section of the screen and is listed as a selection window .
&quot; in the default value increases &amp; k@@ may ; the range around the mouse poin@@ ter , such as an movable Lu@@ pe . alternatively , you can display a selected screen area in the screen window ( selection process mode ) or the area of mouse pointing at the screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter button . please note , the &amp; k@@ may ; currently not able to recognize the form of mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can shift it with the arrow and buttons , and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can cut the contents of the enlargement window and move it with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the &amp; Shift key , press or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the box window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window will remain firmly and just to move the lower right corner . &quot;

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive strain in@@ jury syndrome ) and each mouse click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people who em@@ ulate the repet@@ itive strain In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and those of each mouse click pain . this requires a little exercise .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that are caused by clicking the mouse , and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can also search for pain that are related to your computer using the use of your computer , if this is not done yet . &quot;
&quot; to say it even more : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain prevents , when cli@@ pped with the mouse , it is against pain that are caused by pressing the mouse , it is us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result may drop for each different . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you break down the movement briefly .
&quot; the smart shift is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it is executed by pressing the mouse button . you now move the mouse button until the end of the mouse is executed . at this way , you can perform the drag with pressed mouse button . this way you can get a little exercise , but you get used quickly . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the mouse movement , this ref@@ us@@ ement must be hidden before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es is switched on , the turning time is switched on ( 1 / 10 s ) , the set time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the supp@@ ress the mouse button lets you get rid of the mouse button , if any mouse is due to the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now activ@@ ates the click through the mouse button . this function is activated , followed by a break , followed by a break , a click on the right mouse button . a slow down to the left and return a double click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can reduce &amp; K@@ DE ; to do this , the response time is shortened . open the sound system and here the riders here . there is a sh@@ al@@ eg@@ ler sound buffer that you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , will &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; K@@ DE ; this function is currently only under &amp; K@@ DE ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please check the respective documentation to find out how you automatically launch a program . &quot;
&quot; set all settings on the values back , which were set when opening the dialog . have you already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the last pressures of users . &quot;
&quot; best use you &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular the smart t@@ anning , you should first be switched off . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can leave the smart shifting . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease the response times by &amp; K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not represent a link . you cannot park the mouse at such places until you would like to use it again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse is ru@@ ck@@ eted , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to pull out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear when you check out the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
if you have removed the ball you would have to see the rolls . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . dirt and so@@ iling can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or finger@@ nail .
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system opens the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you just use a shift in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the surgery cannot stop by rele@@ asing the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , using another window manager and move one window . &quot;
the solution for this problem is that you can carry a mouse click here . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
&quot; problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse click and sets the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor position to place where you want to make it . but you can &apos;t bring the mouse on a neutral area of working area if you don &apos;t want to make sure that the mouse is un@@ solved . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter and menus and the front@@ lines of windows .
&quot; I &apos;m trying to work with smart movements , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart t@@ anning is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes its time before you can cope with it . it &apos;s very probably possible to add it into the clip@@ board or to add it to any other action . however , it will probably get some problems whatsoever . here are some advice on this : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart t@@ anning , if you just start to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use text instead follows : perform at the end of the text area a mouse click here and hold the Um@@ sch@@ alt button , while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and once again the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . by doing so , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button closes the shifting time . so you know exactly when the smart re@@ plac@@ ements are starting . later you can use the smart shifting also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X window ; installed , which should be the case in most system . &quot;
the audi@@ ble cli@@ cks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers that are set correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; used the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter shortly . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I Syndrome and to which the fe@@ ed@@ itary pain is preparing .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured as if a certain time is waiting for you to get rid of the mouse button before the mouse button lets you get started . in this way you can also remove the pulling and drag with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which silent users can talk to their computer for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . users can select from a list of a list of talk movements that will be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the assistant ( left screen photo ) , enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . more details can be found in the description of the setup dialog@@ s . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , you can choose the standard textbook manual . in the text passages you can often choose the textbook without typ@@ ing . the text passages can be processed naturally . &quot;
&quot; on the third side ( right screen photo ) , you determine the dictionary for the word office . &amp; mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can compare the p@@ lists using an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only properly sp@@ elled words can be taken into the Wor@@ ter@@ elles . &quot;
the main window of &amp; mouth ; it is obvious and contains essentially an input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ uting of your movements ( the lower white field of screen photo ) and a delay memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field of screen photo ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth ; right , you can enter the pro@@ positions you want to listen to the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the memory memory . you can select phr@@ ases that are spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the Settings menu settings / mouth ; set up ... Read the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , speech output and settings , the word of the user , and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the Cart@@ a Card , you will give the command to the voice @-@ click command . in the box below , the code is fixed , with text on the language generator . &quot;
&amp; mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text remains unchanged as standard input on the language generator .
&quot; the check box is not selected , the text can be submitted as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; of course , the order on voice is made from your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation on your language generator . examples for this will be found in App@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with possible kt@@ ts@@ d as language service is used &amp; mouth ; as the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , the further settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d @-@ language service is an &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ uses a standar@@ dised interface for speech output , and which is currently not installed in SV@@ N . this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selection of a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the key@@ note or by choosing a text passage in the text passages or in the case of text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of immediate response the selected text passage is spoken directly , and in addition to the input memory , the chosen text passage is initially only entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection box of editing the Processing tab , you can define whether the textbook book can be saved automatically by switching the edit window . &quot;
&quot; when you select the selection of text passages , the book is stored . if you don &apos;t select any changes , the textbook is not stored on you , will ask &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the textbook is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the section of the word section includes a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word @-@ use . in the main window , next to the Command field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a sel@@ ective box , if this list includes more than a dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for the word @-@ type . &quot;
&quot; with buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add dic@@ tion@@ aries of the books , or export them into a file . below the list you can adjust the language and the language for the dictionary . &quot;
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; mouth ; reads the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply collected by comparison of the occurr@@ ence . in addition , you can compare the speech list using an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to include only properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
this option allows you to merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries is collected and how they are weigh@@ ted .
&quot; with this option , insert a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re@@ issued words automatically in the dictionary , you will create a dictionary for your vocabulary throughout the time . &quot;
the main window of the window for processing of text passages is double @-@ divided . in the upper part the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you select a text passage , you can change the text passage or the related key papers , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions like new text passages or books , or select selected text passages and books , you can either delete the choice in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar , or over a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; the sequence of text passages or text passages , you can change by drag with the mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ button . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied into the clip@@ board . in case a text section is selected , otherwise the selected areas of the s@@ etter is used . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied into the clip@@ board . if the text section is selected , the selected text is used , otherwise the selected areas of the s@@ etter is used . &quot;
&quot; the currently active movement is spoken . if text in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the s@@ etter is used . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is connected , a different tool bar with buttons used for frequently used commands . the tool bar is arranged directly under the menu bar directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the sli@@ pping left and drag the tool bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed on , there will be a narrow base in the bottom part of the main window with hin@@ ts about the condition of &amp; mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is connected , a different bar for text passages with entries is displayed . the bar is arranged directly under the processing window directly under the tool bar . by mouse click on the sli@@ pping left and drag the tool bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; you probably have the command to do not properly , or not fully entered the command for speech output . open Settings ... , open the page General settings and enter the order for speech output in speech output . ( see application dialog for speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . ) &quot;
&quot; Festival is a German edition of the Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ z are currently supported . the license allows to use the festival free of charge , and spread no restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to indicate an example of the command line for the language issue , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / us@@ r / local / festival . the command is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently he only supports English pron@@ unci@@ ation . license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and spread without restrictions .
&quot; for example , to show a command line for the establishment of speech output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / us@@ r / local / local file . the speech is then possible with one of the three command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option has to be turned on as default settings . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . he conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ emen in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei . therefore you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ em@@ es . license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text in phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / us@@ r / local / local / m@@ bro@@ la is installed . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax is happy to send the last sign of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples : &quot;
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / us@@ r / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ file / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ;
all parts of the command must be written in one line . sending data as default input must be enabled .
the speech output of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is an &amp; K@@ DE group ; a standard interface for speech output is available . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various speech output systems .
&quot; since the language can only be seen in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use week@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; mouth . &quot;
&quot; to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD language , which appears in the dialog box of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully used , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on each of your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&amp; mouth ; is an application that can &apos;t speak with the people who can &apos;t speak text by the computer . it is saved by a list of already carried out pro@@ positions that can always be able to re @-@ release the user .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer contains . on the computer a language syn@@ thesizer has to be installed .
detailed user documentation you will find with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL into the address Bar of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or start help@@ help@@ center help : / mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - The speech output system of &amp; K@@ DE ; - is a service provided of modules that enables every application to use text via the &amp; bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for speech output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; programmer ready to be equipped with the applications using T@@ TS skills . also the users can offer interesting opportunities .
read texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; also if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications embedded .
&quot; the speech is carried out by the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , the various background programme such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
the generation of language expend@@ itu@@ res allows the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ help program .
&quot; in the future : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; speech service of &amp; K@@ DE ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ bus ; offers . &quot;
application of &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d on kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a web page or parts thereof .
&quot; a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; , with which a text file can be read all or partially . &quot;
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ops . subscribe to the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ box / list@@ info / K@@ DE Acc@@ essi@@ bility . the developers can also be found in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # K@@ DE Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts , you will need to install command @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set properly . see also &quot;
&quot; for the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or so long as long as no speaker are set up , the card speaker will be displayed . see also . if you have set at least one speaker , the card card will be posted . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as various male or female , or such that differs in volume or speed . you should also set multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher may use the standard speaker . &quot;
various speakers for the same syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable with multiple printing units for the same printer .
&quot; when you click on the box speaker , the speaker speakers will be displayed in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . this will appear automatically if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
&quot; all actors appear on this list . the preferred speaker appears above in the list . the speaker is used for speech output , when an application does not require any speaker . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker on the list a line further down . the sequence of spokes@@ persons in the list determines its priority . &quot;
Click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system .
&quot; here you choose a voting type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a jun@@ k and girls . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new spokes@@ man will appear on the map speaker . to change the settings of this talk , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost run . go back to the map and check if language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to allow text to read and manage text . Click on the card to create and manage text orders . see .
&quot; if you have set at least one speaker , you can start the language output system of &amp; K@@ DE ; Click on the cart@@ el card to open the card card . here you can adjust some general options . &quot;
&quot; check this check box in order to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this will start the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text orders and read text orders . see . remove the marking , will be K@@ TT@@ SD and read the T@@ TS system of &amp; K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field output is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed . &quot;
&quot; if this check@@ box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr automatically appears in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the advance is completed . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this row you can start text orders , ab@@ ort , stop and recording again . &quot;
with the buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; clip@@ board or read a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a mission .
&quot; Click on users or OK , then all changed settings on all sides are taken over . &quot;
&quot; the flash@@ card orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD was started . in order to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the box and cross the language issue ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check the text , which should be read before , and select the main menu tools read text . after a short time , the speech should start . &quot;
it is almost always sense to mark the desired text of a web site . you can also ski@@ p this step but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ er and other un@@ seen brands are also read .
&quot; in &amp; Kate , the advanced text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read the text , check it out , and then select the text that should read before , and select the main menu tools reading text . then the language output should start . &quot;
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta .
K@@ Not@@ ebook is the message system of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can inform you of the specified events . you can also read the text of this messages also from &amp; kt@@ ts .
&quot; in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can set up different types of messages ; for example , you can notify several kinds of messages when in an IR@@ C channel is a message appears in which your Nick@@ name is found . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C news release . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; program K@@ Not@@ ebook , appears to be a menu entry messages in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ not@@ ebooks differ according to application . &quot;
&quot; you have a good option in &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example to correct . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is sent to the scope of delivery &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . you remove the tags b@@ r and b from the news that is sent by mail , and additionally the expression / local / In@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases than provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not required .
&quot; in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to substitute false words or short@@ cuts , to select a matching language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differs four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the release of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ars has the highest priority . it is drawn to all other orders and holds orders . if the release of the screen readers will be read , orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; Process@@ or is reserved for hot . a warning has prec@@ e@@ dence and holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the release of the warning .
News have the next batch priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; you can welcome a long text on a website . &amp; K@@ DE ; you can welcome someone who has just entered the room . &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also news .
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order you encounter by the card orders , is a textbook . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that are used essays . text orders are thought for the output longer texts that have no special pressures . &quot;
&quot; all four tab@@ s are working in waiting long , with the exception of the issue of screen re@@ a@@ ars . when an application sends the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre@@ ti@@ led , this edition will be stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters never be applied to the issue of screen re@@ a@@ ars . they are used on normal war@@ nings , messages and essays as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News . &quot;
filters work the text and give it on the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are made as modules . in the future there can be more types of filters .
&quot; replace parts of a text by text , replace parts of a text by other text . it can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will enable the use of chat @-@ che@@ ek icons ; or by text or for the format of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding of comprehen@@ sible shape . &quot;
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) around &amp; XML ; produced by a format in another format . in the scope of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are contained in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with talking point filters you can depend on the content of text or , depending on the program that send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to an speaker . if you have sent a female voice , for example , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters can be applied , according to which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter shows that its rules does not apply , he will remain the text unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent out by all activated filters , which are set out on the side below . the processing of the filter is carried out in the list below . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the included normal filters . filter is not enabled , it is not enabled and is not used . filters will be removed after the top down . &quot;
&quot; Click here to insert a new filter . select the kind of filter , and it will be displayed below the following setup dialog@@ ues . &quot;
&quot; for the device of strings filtering filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison sample , then the text will be exchanged in text , then the text is exchanged for the associated replacement parts . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name , it must only differ from the name of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter resem@@ bles the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it with the string from the column . the list is shown in the shown order from above down@@ wards .
Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons you can download a list of words or regular expressions of a file , save the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered , the filter is only applied if the speaker for the text order is one of the listed languages . Click the button to select a list of languages . you can also select several languages if you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button on the mouse click . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID @-@ run programs will receive you with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ numbers need to wake up . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 allows you to enter only . &quot;
&quot; the string filter filter is only applied to the text , if all conditions with one entry in the box sealing filter apply if necessary . all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when compar@@ ing words , the drawing filter filtering filter regul@@ ates regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited on both sides by part@@ itions ( spaces ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find no manual for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions in the package am@@ big@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such formations . it can only be used on well @-@ shaped XML . the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough . &quot;
&quot; with the speaking filter you can send texts to a certain speaker , who is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can choose to read the text by k@@ mail from a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text placed on the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker properties that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send the text on the card speaker . with the Speaker display , you can write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is applied if the text contains the specified regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regul@@ ating the button to get help at entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression on the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you place the properties of the search for you . when the text provided the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected to display the desired requirements at the most likely . Click on the right to display the dialog button . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to save , store or delete all settings . &quot;
&quot; the speaking filter is applied only then to the text , if all conditions with one entry in the box sealing filter apply if applicable . you have to apply for at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the speech API , from &amp; K@@ DE ; , with the programmer to give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with which the language syn@@ thesizer are added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that it can use this syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
the following section includes a short description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ interface of the language issue API of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can find the full documentation for both AP@@ Is ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice services via the &amp; bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; K@@ DE ; the program kt@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; this includes text from the text to read and option a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are more commands you can apply . for a list of all commands .
&quot; open two &amp; console ; open windows , start a window in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ re@@ formed filter , but not read for the use of the module for festival websites . &quot;
&quot; due to a bug in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone , so that you do not work at all , if you do not have this voice to read Web pages . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or inter@@ section characters seem to cause mistakes when syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so all pro@@ positions of ski@@ pping or just Kau@@ b is spent . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain characters or words , may these may be fixed by a string bag filter . &quot;

KT@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesizer which can be started on the command line in one &amp; console ;
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , consider the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , after information which are not yet contained in this manual . &quot;
the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of other syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , you sit with the Develop@@ er team . &quot;
&quot; the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not compulsory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ts ; for comp@@ iling , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the pack@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; System disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you refer to the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text archive for k@@ de@@ ya , or you can currently download and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if you are using a speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher with your language syn@@ thesizer . in addition , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts . 4.4 is the first version of the product disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed directly , so that the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed directly and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer required . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken into single sentences . the user can go or go back , repeat the output or break down . &quot;
&quot; if an application has text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; over , you can request the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you choose a speaker , this is used , otherwise the best matching speaker would be selected . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker is chosen , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the map speaker , click on Add to edit a speaker into the list or click on Edit , the card speaker system will be displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown . details on the modules can be found under . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you &apos;ll just need to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the text encoding for text that will be handed to festival . by voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is generally accepted that Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 to use eastern languages like Czech or Slovak ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you don &apos;t choose a few controllers and you cannot select this grey , you don &apos;t let the voice selected these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ sy@@ n votes require a few seconds to be loaded after their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already syn@@ thes@@ ized at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with greater memory consumption ) the first sentence will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster . &quot;

&quot; this check box is indicated , at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window is indicated . otherwise , only the icon was visible in the system section , but not the program window . Click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the check@@ box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not running , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . by doing so , you have the opportunity to read or control otherwise . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders in the qu@@ eue recording , along with the application that has set the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the just worked sentence . the spokes@@ man ID corresponds to the ID ID on the card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this row , you can put a sat@@ in on the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;

&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices covers all PCM devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device with you . in doubt , choose standard . &quot;
&quot; on this card card you can set special action , which will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the release of Screen Re@@ a@@ ars has the highest priority . it is drawn up to all other orders and re@@ covers these orders . after the release of the screen readers will be read , orders received are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warning have the next room priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; Process@@ or is reserved for hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the advance of the warning .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that reads messages . if you &amp; eg ; just leave a long text on a Web site , you can begin with &amp; mouth ; nevertheless someone will welcome you who enters the space . &quot;
&quot; will be a text contract interrupted by a message , warning , or issue of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output is waiting for the qu@@ eue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both single @-@ conduc@@ tive sound is active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card card only apply for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and the editions of Screen Re@@ a@@ ars there are no particular actions , if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;

&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark the text for a speech output . this standard contains brands for control of voices , voice speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also brand for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of language abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are present :
&quot; you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as this is the standard voice , is the festival in the issue of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch configuration is not limited to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , the SS@@ ML text is generally speaking very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter ( SD@@ B filters ) . thus , it can start &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with reading , because only the first sentence must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus , you can also stop or stop or break out , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically established as a set @-@ level recognition filter , but you can change its settings or add other pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filters . &quot;
&quot; at the sim@@ pl@@ est you will learn the setup selection , and enter text , and enter text to read , please add some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s selection has changed . of course , you need to have some more properties and check how the filter &apos;s selection has changed , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then can begin with the advance , since only the first sentence can be processed and not the whole word block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; if the language syn@@ thesizer are not supported , you can refer to the card memory , or if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter will be set up automatically if you start week@@ t@@ gr for the first time . it can not be switched off , unless you know what you do . &quot;
&quot; compare the pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter , compare text with a regular expression of pro@@ positi@@ onal and paste a tab@@ ular sign ( dec@@ imal number 8 ) to the proposition sign ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard pro@@ positi@@ onal sign filter controls the character . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; messages ( k@@ is@@ ) , war@@ nings , messages or the issue of screen re@@ a@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from compar@@ ing the normal set @-@ bor@@ on filter , you can insert this again by inviting the file _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; selecting the card reader , you can write the message settings for the application . the card card is displayed if possible . &quot;
use of the default speakers ( the top on board speaker ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
&quot; use of the matching speaker , which shows all features of an integrated microphone , cho@@ oses or edit it ; select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker out , the most likely , originally introduced properties . &quot;
&quot; select the method for entering the desired speaking properties , click on one of the selection button . &quot;
&quot; here , select the properties of the desired speaking part . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , enter nothing . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other features . you can also set up several markings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when understanding is the issue , it is always treated as a priority attribute . you will rarely use this attribute . the only case you may want to specify the attribute language , if you know that a certain application has been introduced in another language as the result in the environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the field of speaker , which is the most likely to be deleted , click on the selection button , and then apply on speaker , which is equal to the following . &quot;
in this case 0 for the last text order in the qu@@ eue line . you can also state a order number . ( without order number is the input 0 required ) .
at the kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr crash@@ es immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support but I don &apos;t get any tra@@ ce@@ ability .
&quot; G@@ stre@@ amer is down and finished . G@@ stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , you may have an un@@ compatible version of G@@ spre@@ amer . you may try to update or install G@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
the audio output of AL@@ SA does not work when I play music with another application . if I get a text order fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message that says : &apos; to open PCM .
&quot; on your system , there is a problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA will be able to prevent the simultaneous opening of several PCM devices . for possible solutions , please visit the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I uploaded an additional voice on the Internet . I installed them and can use it in Festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show that voice . &quot;
&quot; in the file , add $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / Vo@@ ices the new voice . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if that &apos;s successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the card audio , there is a setting speed . thus , the program SO@@ X has to be installed and via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ des such as festival Interactive offer a setting for speaking speed . depending on the selected voice this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts . ( this is because the HTML is controlled . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are very cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ yz file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML file format , and put the talk speed up . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t create it that web pages are prepared with a female voice . I have set up a female voice speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts . reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER is not functioning . this will not be a mistake , elimin@@ ating the X@@ SL file to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a specific string bag filter , and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more sat@@ in @-@ way or go back . on the flash@@ back orders will be displayed , the mission stood only of a set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; inter@@ section characters ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . use a filter for the pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems using &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org )
&quot; G@@ stre@@ amer at version 0.@@ 8.7 or later , please note : make sure the modules for G@@ stre@@ amer are registered by calling for the use of G@@ stre@@ amer at &amp; kt@@ ts . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org ) &quot;
some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with the audio issue . if your system is also part of it you can &apos;t play music and start a text and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de has not yet supported any real breaks . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , then the current sentence will be read . &quot;
&quot; the audio program SO@@ X is used for the general attitude of the speaking speed , but otherwise not necessarily required . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ X with the command apt @-@ get install SO@@ X . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , log in as normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball in a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4 will be the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only on request .
&quot; the following modules for voice syn@@ thesizer are created by default . some of them have a running time @-@ dependent movement of non @-@ free software . ( not @-@ free according to the direc@@ tives of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) . the configure parameters , which results in the process . &quot;
&quot; the default value is set &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 , this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify as option --@@ pre@@ fix = target . for example &quot;

&quot; before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if your language syn@@ thesizer operates properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices are generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , voice speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
you have to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that are supplied with festival . you would like to read the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for these voices , you have to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code from the festival . the German voices are subject to limitations . &quot;
&quot; this voice sets the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ zip the software in festival / li@@ b / Vo@@ ices / etc . if you enter the Russian votes , you have to use C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; check boxes as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the code should be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use Russian voice , the encoding must be set to a 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . then Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ik@@ al analysis and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; creates the audio output . the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ program and the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; no complete voice play@@ system is . &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; generated language from Di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone .

&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ il@@ lo@@ ff language syn@@ thesizer , which has been written in &amp; Java ; that you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you cannot set up pitch , volume , or talk speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled at a console ; on the command line can be controlled . &quot;
&quot; best to use a command that writes the speech output into a temporary audio file ( wav ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; storage center ; allows network interface management , ro@@ uting and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; storage center ; allows users to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; may be called by selecting K menu . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package is designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; the network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; menu . &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware can &apos;t install . physical devices and their drivers must already be operational and configured in order to be configured and configured it to the network characteristics .
&quot; in most cases drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed on installing &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . network devices later added , the drivers must be loaded by adjust@@ ing the following files , according to the kernel version . &quot;
&quot; the network settings will be loaded when the network settings will be selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; -@@ Index is selected , when the module &apos;s network settings tries to automatically detect the used platform on the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform can not be recognized , the free choice is offered . it is the platform made from the list which will meet the distribution and Rel@@ eas@@ ing and best . by marking the setting of non @-@ res@@ ent@@ ment it may be made permanently . at the next start of network settings , this selection will be set automatically . &quot;
&quot; the change of network settings is possible only in the system management mode . before , all options are displayed grey , which means that the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can click on the right bottom end of module . it is necessary to enter the password mode . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the module &apos;s total functionality is available . this is divided into three riders : &quot;
the riders network interfaces to manage the system &apos;s network devices . all available network devices are displayed . from the riders network interfaces the following tasks can be performed :
the settings required network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button interface ... in the dialog device can be set up .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the button extension refers to the dialogue with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; automatically retri@@ eve the TCP / IP settings by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP server will provide all the required TCP / IP information at any system start@@ up , and therefore no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with selecting manu@@ ell , the TCP / IP address can be made available without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the required TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alize the network interface in boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog , values are displayed as properties of the device in the device box . &quot;
it should be ensured that IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can find if the required address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off . switching from a switched network device is performed by selecting from the list and click Interface ....
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off . off , activate a activated network device by selecting from the list and click Interface .... &quot;
&quot; speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical link to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be connected to the network where the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a machine with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS resol@@ ves this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the machine for the name resolution part of the company name solution enables simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed value @-@ .@@ DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a read and execution in the list with buttons up or down in priority . &quot;
by clicking the button e ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution can be added a DNS server . it will be added to the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry is inserted in the list .
&quot; from the Group hosts for the name resolution , select an entry and then click on button Edit .... The dialog box will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the list of name describes computer @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily in boats , if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networking , it can replace the DNS server . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains some famous computers , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses are supported . this still in the test version of IP is intended to replace the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well known computer and click Add .... The dialog New also is displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known computer , and add the button to add several alias names , de kno@@ b adds several times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a well @-@ known host from the list and select Edit .... The dialog box is displayed .
&quot; one of the following tasks can be executed , then with click OK the list of static hosts is updated . &quot;
&quot; settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system , to enable the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command should be removed . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net to download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distribution ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; K@@ DE and Q@@ t are installed .
installing the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool with a graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE is sufficient ; not , but additionally , development packages with libraries and other things are required . &quot;
&quot; this is only highly experienced users recommended . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; for comp@@ iling . the following commands should make this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental network technology will be given , in the second , all by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changeable configuration files . &quot;
this area can not replace any knowledge about IP networks . in this anne@@ x only basic information is communic@@ ated via the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network .
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . it has never been widespread circulation . from IPv6 , it is expected to focus in near future . therefore , this description is based on the widespread IPv4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is to acknowledge the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is possible or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be selected . in any case , IP address may not be simply chosen . &quot;
&quot; when using an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a particular reserved area to avoid IP address correspondence with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , hence their use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by adjust@@ ing a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , usually addresses in the range of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the range is designed for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask will usually be on 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all hosts participants are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route will be needed for IP further . &quot;
&quot; the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address is assigned to a fully @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit . &quot;
&quot; in this part , the configuration files which are stored by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , this file is changed dynam@@ ically in DSL connections , so it is not surprising when in the event of active DSL connections , there is a different content than specified there . &quot;

&quot; &amp; dat ; is a security program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar , which presented my wife : how much longer lasts it when you sec@@ ures ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; dat ; it can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat ; sp@@ ells the band back and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the tape . recogni@@ zes &amp; dat , if the band is form@@ at@@ ted on the tape , you will be asked whether the band is form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
det@@ ects &amp; dat ; the pre@@ sp@@ ell is looking for the matching index on your record . can it not be found if the band index is to be created .
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol changes for the tape drive to indicate that the band was integrated . in the Status Bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before dis@@ card the tape , first , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this : &quot;
&amp; dat ; can be seen through a change of the symbol for the band that the integration of the tape was solved and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar . the band can now be kicked off without a risk .
&quot; before a volume of &amp; dat , it is to be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; dat ; form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; a band of tape must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can use to store data . this process does not have to form@@ at@@ ted with the form@@ att@@ ing , it must be form@@ at@@ ted before you are form@@ at@@ ted by the band of &amp; dat . flo@@ ppy tape drives are usually not form@@ at@@ ted . flo@@ ppy tape drives are not on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after entering the tape and the capacity is &amp; dat , with the shap@@ ing of the tape . all data on the tape are lost , the band is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you have to select the secured files . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or the folder is secured .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
mark files in the local file tree with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . only the so @-@ selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are secured .
&quot; to the right mouse button , click on the local file @-@ tree and select in the menu ... &quot;
&quot; once the backup was introduced , the dialogue settings for backup is opened . in this dialog you can check the selected files and modify the settings for backup . &quot;
when you have confirmed the settings the dialog appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
&quot; mark a file or folder in one of the files for the drive . it is checked , only the selected file or the folder . &quot;
mark the files in one of the files for the tape with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are checked .
clicking with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry button ....
&quot; once the test procedure was started , the dialog appears to check . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the inspection process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can recon@@ struct the restore , the files that are to be restored will be marked . this can be done on two types : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the tape drive . it will only re@@ produce the selected file or sub@@ folder . &quot;
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . only the so @-@ selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be restored .
&quot; with the right mouse button , click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu .... &quot;
&quot; once the restart process started , the dialog appears to restore . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears to re@@ produce . this dialog displays the progress of the process and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing in@@ dex@@ files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this will create a backup profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for the safety profile :
&quot; the current working folder , where the backup should be made . the list of files are automatically updated according to the selected work folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folders that are listed under the backup files , the files are stored on the same file system , as the folders . folders that are on other file systems , you can enter separately under the backup files . every record is considered tar by tar . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last domestic backup , a snap@@ shot file is secured , which have since changed since then . &quot;
&quot; the name of the file , which is used to consoli@@ date changes since last time . &quot;
&quot; delete the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created . &quot;
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; LT ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of the creation of this documentation .
you can adjust the settings on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to device file for tape drive ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the band@@ th@@ ier .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat , before the band is integrated into the drive . in some drives it is necessary before reading or write operations can be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , tries &amp; dat , to lock the throw at the tape drive . possibly this attitude will not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , the option is enabled , if the bond is cast off , automatically the band will automatically be kicked off . don &apos;t use this option for flo@@ ppy streaming . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , tries &amp; dat ; the hard@@ war@@ p block size for tape drives . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must notify &amp; dat ; in any case the block size for your band run . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , it is writing a file at the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this sequence is computer name : seconds , whereby the host name of the system is form@@ at@@ ted on which the tape has been form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds , which has been form@@ at@@ ted since the era , in which the band has been form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can directly manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental f@@ uses . &quot;
&quot; examine the contents of a backup book . this symbol is only active , if a band is integrated . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log , is a &amp; K@@ DE ; panel viewer for system protocols . the program is not suitable for experienced users or where the system can get information about your system or where the system enables quick access to information about problems that will appear on their server . &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users understand what your calcul@@ ator is doing in the background . the program is suitable for experienced users that can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , business system log ; experienced users enables quick access to information about problems that arise on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore , attempts to provide some extended functions , which can be filtered and analysed with the help of the protocol . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log , has a number of useful features . among other things , include : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions also are also included in the other chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen photo , displays &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; features the individual protocol @-@ lines of a protocol @-@ file easy to filter and sort . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start &amp; track system log ; initially the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - to open the system log , and it opens with a small message window , so you don &apos;t have a small message window , so you don &apos;t have to own a small message screen . the protocol files usually do not have a permission to read in the folder / var / log . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter for the selected crit@@ eri@@ on , or to filter for a selected crit@@ eri@@ on . in the default setting , the list of protocols may be displayed next to the filter . in the default settings , a protocol line will only be displayed next if in one of the columns containing the filter value chain . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry at this point . select the string search term , and then apply only with entries in the according to selected columns , and then apply the filter system into the name of a process , and show you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines , which were sent from this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in default settings and helps you to detect the important protocol @-@ lines . protocol @-@ lines of level errors are displayed with a show@@ down color as the protocol lines of level note . the colour display of protocol @-@ lines can be switched off .
&quot; if you want to display only certain processes ( for example , in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , you can choose the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . for example , if you want to investigate the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , you can use the filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can adjust the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window , to display all new added protocol @-@ lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . in order to open this function , use the entries in the menu to open additional sub @-@ window and manage . once you select a sub window , select a protocol to display . &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website to htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more recent information about the development of business system log .

&quot; welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather well known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it rapidly develops to the standard for control of the system start @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ in@@ it . &quot;
I will not continue to go to historical aspects ( including because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it @-@ Bin@@ der file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . This is therefore important because someone might try to recon@@ figure a machine on System V In@@ it , without a new installation and new format . the &amp; Linux ; kernel will be sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was there . &quot;
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it differs from BSD In@@ it that configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this file is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following more folders :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a complete set of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service that you would like to start running the system or change to another Run@@ ning . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services include not such things as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for this . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection . &quot;
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can throw at a glance into the second column and probably notice that the pre @-@ set Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change , then you can manually repair any changes and change the 3 . if you want to change something , then you will rep@@ airing the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start with all the correct scripts ? if you type -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead each entry is a link to one of scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does it start and stops in@@ it system services ? quite simply : each of scripts is written so it is an argument like start and stop accepted . you can actually start these scripts in fact by hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would keep the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if a K includes , the script will be called stop using the argument . if it includes an S , the script will be called with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people wish for setting up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server @-@ level , that can only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; running ; , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy to say not to say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry in the range of availability system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also shift scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or modify the position within one level by turning it somewhere else . this will not happen if they draw up one entry from the range of availability .
&quot; note : entries are post@@ pon@@ ed if you have to put them in a new range . in order to select it merely on a new run@@ level , you &apos;ll have to select from the menu Edit or select from the context menu and then merge into the target range -- even if the same statement has already existed in the target range . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of a entry cannot be charged sometimes . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : there is currently no way to restore entries , which were thrown into the tr@@ ash . be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab button to activate the various work@@ areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move one entry into another lap level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired lap level with insert ( with c@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change sorting number or the name of a entry manually , press the tab button to switch the properties dialog . use the tab button to accept any changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre@@ ferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if they are available . otherwise they are saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the pre@@ ferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts up permanently . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the li@@ lo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode , then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable lap ( 3 should normally be in order ) . &quot;
&quot; I planned some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under run level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only present in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the species , such as system services are started in these distri@@ butions , is simplified the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately not standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using any other distribution , please check if all configuration files are available ( and also if they are located in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) just end without message when their configuration files are not available or false . &quot;
&quot; the importance of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ ning varies from distribution to distribution , can even be used by version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about Run@@ ning so that this manual may be added . &quot;
