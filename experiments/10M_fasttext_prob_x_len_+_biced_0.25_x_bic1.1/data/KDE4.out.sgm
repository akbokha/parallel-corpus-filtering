<seg id="390">"normalize: this method scaled the leukaemia levels above all the image, so the darkest point black and the brightest point so bright as possible without its color shady. this function is often a Magical correction for images which are dark or washed."</seg>
<seg id="391">"the same method uses the brightness factor of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. at times the same very good results with improving the contrast of a picture, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation which causes either miracle in a picture or destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light boundary conditions and improves the red, green and blue channels on the complete histogram area."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast extend: this method improves the contrast and luminous intensity of the RGB values of a picture by the postpone of the lowest and highest values on the maximum possible area and a new jibe of all values. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">"the white-right of & digiraffe, is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white-down of a picture."</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white-equal correction is somewhat limited to a colour space with 8-bit per suit. so, if you can do well from the original picture, areas with overload-mode can be done, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities will be better to correction better."</seg>

<seg id="399">"on the right above, a histogram appears that dynamically changes, once you have a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed. the sum is called Luminanz."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow of your photos or dimming up."</seg>
<seg id="401">"play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then anywhere on the picture-looking for the calculation of the color temperature of the white comparison. on this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the White leaves with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:"</seg>

<seg id="405">The button settings sets all filter values back on their default values and the associated neutral white drop-down. note that neutral settings are added to another photo as your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed. "</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set the coding per color channel of the processed picture here. however, 8-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding is also required for high quality images. this coding is also required for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue such as the processing of raw images. it uses the modification and assignment of color profiles. color tone mapping can be carried out by the forepanel for the use of color profiles. a detailed guidance for the use of color profiles can be applied to the chapter of color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is available in the menu under colors tonic correction. this tool provides an integrated way to save multiple colour channels simultaneously, so this tool is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always require the same mistakes and therefore always require the same correction. in the manual for audio correction you will find further information."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool to gradation that you will find under the colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the color effects gave you four colour effects, a solar effect, a Velvia filter, a Neon Effect and a cantonal filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in the times of the chemical processing was Solarisation, also called Sabatier, a effect that was completed by a short lightening light, and the colour of dark areas protected by the additional light. this result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>

<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy efficiency. the original image is the (1) and that is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy to embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a daylight optimized paint film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. its name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours during daylight and high contrasts. but Velvia offers some of which little landscapes seem too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neon filter simulates Neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonlichts. in large pictures, the filter can upgrade the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual you want to correct the colour counter and lightest photos in the menu. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you'll be used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you are making a photo in bad light conditions you can get the reverse issue: one too big saturation. even in this case the tool for brightness / saturation can be able to increase your saturation. if Him like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tools Gradation and the simple Leuchment / Contrast / Gamma, the tool is also based on improving the exposure. even if the dialog appears to this tool very complicated, you need to explain the use of the use of the slider. more concrete is the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, histogram, active channel or selected areas. under the graphs three sliders are clicked into the inside and can be postponed to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and right side of the bright areas."</seg>

<seg id="479">"& digium, there are three different tool to sharpening. each of you have advantages in other areas."</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool to sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"Unsharpen mask works on the contrast of the edges with a picture sharper. indeed, it is not a bit more psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric dark and it is done here a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and he is protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"the focus is possibly the best of the three, as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised images require a correction of the sharpness. this is the fact that the digitalization process can be put together with only minimum differences to a colour. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras do normally need more than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG pictures, a camera has been applied for internal sharpening. images in the rough format, however, must always be screened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners are already using an sharpening filter during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can receive useful outcomes by sharpest a photo with the sharpening of sharpening. you can allocate to the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should handle it carefully, as the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, you will find more information about the menu entry. under refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution, the image a little soft to draw, is considerably easier than it. use the tool for a soft character with the menu entry, adjust the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">Filter unsharp masked is a very good tool to remove mudge from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help edit the picture. it shows the preview of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or amount increases the effect. if you make the unequal mask to strong, noise and impression of grass in the proximity of sharp edges produce."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels are affected on each side by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radio stations. therefore you should sharpen images best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount indicates the percentage between the original and the illustration, which is added to the original. thereby, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the differential amount. it can therefore define a minimal difference thus, with a soft change between tones of sharpening and therefore beauty errors in faces, heavens and water surface."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp filter. the original picture is the (1) and the processed picture (2). unsharp masked with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiraffe; tool refocus is focused on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected unfissing filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool is trying to make a picture & quot; refocsierc. this is better approach to sharpening. this is better approach to sharpening images. this is a better approach to sharpening images. you can usually start editing images as unsharp. you can start from the menu by retrieving colours.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular flow is much better than the Gauss's Foot. the Gauß's Foot has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixae, which is far from the original cable pixel, which is far from the original pixel size, causing unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular file. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should be 1 good results. if your image is very unsharp, however, in Heiligendamm."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: increasing the correlation can help to reduce arteries. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpensive effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values can be reduced from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 is very bad. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a suitable value is 0,03. a high value will continue to merge the picture."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauge's sharpness. use this parameter when your unsharpen is caused by unsharpened filters. in most cases, you should not use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts, so you may also increase the correlation and / or check the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"size: this value determines the size of transformationatrix, which can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular edge or the Gauge of the focus. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"storing as well as shop buttons are used for that purpose. any Refocus parameters will be placed, that will be saved for later and then can be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all the cutting, colour and intensity structures on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture below. the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read pictures and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, it produces unsharp masked for better results than sharpening. this could be caused by a sharp masked one larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, it is always necessary to produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of unsharpen. for the Viennese filters you can show that it is the optimum linear mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better for processing of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below, you can see a comparison between different filters on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to unenough light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information regarding the methods of sharpening processes in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator is decomposed by the sharpness of the division's sharpness, to create a more natural pupil. "</seg>
<seg id="514">"the colour tinte allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want to keep blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image bugfix is one of the most advanced tool to remove non-desired arteries with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting Algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various preferences as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail protection p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a smooth glass-heap over the image. if larger values are concentrated mainly homogens regions and are sharp. a value of 0.9 should get more details that no sharpening should always be subordinated."</seg>
<seg id="520">"alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothed evenly into all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a movie setting or CCD noise will generate a high level of wave similar patterns. JPEG Artefakte will be best fixed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then define the relative glassment. therefore, set this value as a degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: indicates how often the algorithm is run through. usually 1 or 2 goes out.</seg>
<seg id="524">"Anisotropic alpha. Anisotropic alpha. Anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small selected, it should also be selected small. make sure that small angle produce a long runtime. make sure that small angle produce a long runtime. so, you should select this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral step-length [0,1, 10]: integral step-length in pixels. you should avoid the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the more high quality you can get by selecting this option is only low. it doubles the running time. we recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons stores and loading exactly this. any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="528">"image errors is comparatively very fast to work. however, it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load. so you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button demolition."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors with little artifacts will be corrected. the module will be applied on a photo that is created in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see there is a distinctive black Arteet in the foreground that creates a bad movie camp during the journey. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiants; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Hert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selected image filters to remove spots and other artifacts which come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor screaming from the camera or moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about digital cameras, you can read this tutorial in English in this tutorial."</seg>

<seg id="534">"in the following example, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the sub-window advanced settings can remain at default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time required for filters per pixel. the image is pumped over the image and the color in it becomes smoothed and thus smaller bugs fixed."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpening distance. this value puts the pixel pitch of the filter to the front, if it is increased, you may need to change noise levels. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can't get more and noise or smashing up."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong it can't remove the whole noise or noise damage. if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the picture. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings will not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerance of the picture. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings will not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the eye tolerance of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker sections, which are typically stronger, however, the shadow areas too."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls the adjustment of phasenjittering attenuation. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance may occur. if it is lifted, noise and Phasenjacks may appear on the edges. it can remove noise levels and is the recommended method for this."</seg>
<seg id="542">"store and loading: these buttons are used for this. all parameters for the noise reduction, which you have set, can be stored into the file system and later charges later."</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how caterdecrease your life can change. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected version (2) and is used with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">"sometimes a picture is crunchy for your purpose. the solution, the picture is a little soft to draw, is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen, and experimenting with the glar. see the impact on the right side of the dialog it shows the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiants; photo Restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo file.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for the restoration process gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, filmmakers, scratches, compression, compression and compilable pictures of image contours and thus preserves the content as it does the human eye."</seg>

<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the values exceeds the given threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixel size, which can be tracked individually and further on further subdivision, you can adjust the maximum depth of records."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn jittering, changing & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizers which are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events translated into events which understands synthesizer."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI-map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always lets the trumpet sound when originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you only have one sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map, because all sound cards are GM-compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"sorry, there is no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the respective file from hand (with your favorite ditor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that saves all the required changes for playing a piece.</seg>

<seg id="1659">"you see that Define is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for options) and end, that the end of a section is reached."</seg>
<seg id="1660">"please send me your Map file as e-mail, so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can offer for devices which are not general MIDI-compatible."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in this section, the patches of General MIDI is displayed on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign will be ignored. it is believed that the GM patches are in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument supports, on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can define a drum for example (e.g. with tone 60), which is similar to a tissue surplus. for this purpose, use the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (a tissue shooting), it takes a patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of what tone is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the concept drum patch of the patch is meant, with which any sound represents a different percus instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the clay is the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">KEYMAP section is used to indicate how tones are displayed on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important as well as its presence. so you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several Keymaps for every channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">"in particular, Keymaps are used mainly to form tones on the Perkah channel. check out as an example the supplied keyboard maps."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to exchange some channels on others. if you want to change the first and second channel, simply make it easy at the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"n is part of the channel, which is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, you will need to change the keymap with the name name for this channel! if you are using the Forcepatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, then always Patch x is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the Perkite patch on the perkite channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio, in which proportion of Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied, if a MIDI file is converted with the value n * (r / 4096), and then it will be forwarded with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then the value of 4096 is used to be found in the Map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard that should be playing a Pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately some keyboards around two sounds can be played higher. to try the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid. "</seg>

<seg id="1678">"the Kanalview is a window with a whole series of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on these piviatures, you see what sounds just played."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a select list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed a instrument, the button doesn't use any more green but red, to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>

<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played. it contains the scores, the rhythm, speed, & etc. so that I can perform the same MIDI file on two different devices at very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same scores in very different ways."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for the same. why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the posts made many changes and at the same time he had corrected much changes at the same time. another programmers had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was a large number of conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me was shown only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within this lines. and there was no evidence in the places where perhaps only the impression was changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3 was added; however, differences were added to a line and modifications to white characters. later, some more useful features were added later."</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you would like to compare the text, you simply copy it into the clipboard and add it in one of the comparative window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">"also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful if two people work independent from each other in one piece of code and changes to changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. this editor shows three Quell files at the same time:"</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you with the comparisons and merge file. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; with folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; shows the precise differences, and the possibilities of current colour monitors. if you frequently need code-monitors, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters you can see that at a glance at the Summary in the column on the left side. (no anger more if no one changes the entry.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">"when a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates that file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can simplify the tipparwork by simply writing the file names in the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">"photo folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder, diff3 folder, diff3 folder, folder 2 folder 3 folder 2 folder 3 folder"</seg>
<seg id="2294">"the opening dialog allows the manual of filename file names, selecting from the file browser (file...) or select one last file from the opener list. you do not specify a third file; if you have to leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of differences with two files will be done."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"if merge is working, the input field is active for target and can process itself. however, it is not necessarily required to immediately notice an output file immediately. you can also do this step further when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set button opens a dialog with settings. here you can define the options before you start with the comparisons / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you do not want to compare all the file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window. compared begins, you can't select files easily with the break-button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drag: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let him fall over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you would like to figure out what these functions are, it would be quite a great effort. you would need to copy only two corresponding files, then compare and compare it to the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can do nothing of & kdiff3. only the drop of text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors will interpret the draw and drag text into another program as cutting and insertion (instead of copying and insertion). in such a case your original data may be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"in the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional), leave the mouse to a while above the line. then you will see a small relief window to the full name.)"</seg>

<seg id="2306">"in addition to the text, the summarizing column is found. if differences were found, the color indicates the appropriate color. in some programming languages, the colour is not so important, it is useful only to see the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g., white characters are relevant only in strings and commentary, for the processor and in a few, rare cases relevant.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line, which separates the summary column from the text, is interrupted in places where the respective source file is not enabled. if the line breaks is activated, the line is shown to broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (under the comparison list) also has a info line with the inscription output:, the filename and [Change] if you have edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts."</seg>

<seg id="2312">"sometimes, by automatic merge or manual editing there is no further line left in the group; then it is only a placeholder for the event that you can change your opinion, and perhaps again choose another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marker you may want to copy and elsewhere."</seg>

<seg id="2968">How does it start and stops init system services? quite simply: each of scripts is written so it is an argument like start and stop accepted. you can actually start these scripts in fact by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would keep the httpd server. init reads the name, and if a K includes, the script will be called stop using the argument. if it includes an S, the script will be called with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish for setting up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server-level, that can only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; running;, network & etc;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to say not to say trivial: simply drag an entry in the range of availability system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also shift scripts between Runleveln or modify the position within one level by turning it somewhere else. this will not happen if they draw up one entry from the range of availability.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are postponed if you have to put them in a new range. in order to select it merely on a new runlevel, you'll have to select from the menu Edit or select from the context menu and then merge into the target range -- even if the same statement has already existed in the target range."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of a entry cannot be charged sometimes. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: there is currently no way to restore entries, which were thrown into the trash. be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab button to activate the various workareas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move one entry into another lap level, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired lap level with insert (with ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change sorting number or the name of a entry manually, press the tab button to switch the properties dialog. use the tab button to accept any changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu require a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if they are available. otherwise they are saved by & ksysv; changes to the preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts up permanently. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"enter the lilo -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode, then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable lap (3 should normally be in order)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I planned some system services with & ksysv; for running under run level X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only present in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the species, such as system services are started in these distributions, is simplified the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately not standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using any other distribution, please check if all configuration files are available (and also if they are located in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) just end without message when their configuration files are not available or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of the & Linux; Running varies from distribution to distribution, can even be used by version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about Running so that this manual may be added."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"this documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program, you can manage the users and groups of your system."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & user, it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of & user."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you've made changes, you need to save them. either use the appropriate symbol of the tool bar or the entry to store in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"user / user; is an easy application. the main window is made up of two flashcards, the user and user groups. for Edit, select the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry. it appears the dialogue user and group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some flashcards are displayed only if you have switched extended system settings. only if you can make limited availability (Quota) for users, you will be able to make individual settings. additional flashcards appear, if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD-Unix."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the card password is published, if shadow passwords, or such as / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD -Unix."</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card appears only if for at least a built-in file limitation (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can be changed for each user parameters: the limited limitation of data in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted separately for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the field.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the card groups informs about the group assigned to the selected user. the standard group, which belongs to the user, will find the user in the field of primitive group. furthermore, the user can mark in other groups by marking them in the large field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog Features of the Group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or a group, select from the user or group or click on the appropriate link in the tool bar. editing or delete the selected user, or the selected group."</seg>
