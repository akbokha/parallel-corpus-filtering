although I had visited the USA for at least once a year I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is extremely big .
&quot; like many of my generation I also grew up with American movies , have been dancing to American music , American authors and powered his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a profound impact on me that I was mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less journalist who had faced with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura @-@ student of the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil Magna as the Supreme Court with the judges who wanted his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was it as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; America is the only country in which I ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people . &quot;
I even wrote a very warmer love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me how he goes with his narrow @-@ minded .
he never stops behind the mountain as you are saying so nicely .
&quot; he tells what he thinks of a former colleague , and explains his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his testim@@ onies and agreed in dro@@ ves for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won with the Republican Presi@@ dential elections , was the highest number formed by the nominated candidate . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support these big@@ s person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not be able to meet Tr@@ ump and his voters I had met with people in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; like for example my Professor Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , people from all over the world , a deeply believing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps , also voted among Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I experienced for Sandy B@@ ahr , who fights for their lives to the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as their son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with patience and gent@@ l@@ eness and helped my colleagues to acc@@ ust@@ om us to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then Andrew Lec@@ tures , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me have helped me much in my career . &quot;
these people and those em@@ bodied by they em@@ bodied my love in America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump gave his way to the nomin@@ ate Republican Presi@@ dential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part of its limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the idea of the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump , because they either divided his rac@@ ism and fan@@ at@@ ism , or because they were willing to over@@ see these things , broke my heart almost . &quot;
perhaps it is un@@ fair to call Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as R@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; to arrange people , one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and respec@@ t@@ ful , and imp@@ lies an in@@ ability to understand those who act on another way and think . &quot;
it shows people that their concerns and fears were not taken into account through the hec@@ tic changes in their communities .
&quot; could it be that this voters , of which most of them are , for tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that she dis@@ ap@@ points ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments the cruel decision to rise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t upon those who look different . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m . WC . : as much as the re@@ jection of white against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities &quot; ; word game from white into bac@@ kl@@ ash into the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the big Van Jones called , exactly what America did so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world estimate the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have , America is always welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ i@@ an@@ ers , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; but with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promises and says : to hell with vers@@ atility , religious freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in the Americas , after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the ruin , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
on a rally for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have been my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; Mr Khan . &quot;
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; if Muslims had a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ ared the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if anyone who is not as you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and silent &quot; NO &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; that is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , &quot; said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could no place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ dish town Cat@@ e@@ ura in common ?
&quot; the music that is played at both places , not only the life of children has changed , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the apost@@ asy
&quot; Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby magnificent Tuscan Ru@@ ins and its famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years , La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) is now playing in the municipality : one of the children and adults of existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which has found their musical instruments an opportunity to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and gangs violence . &quot;
but this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hop@@ el@@ essness .
the young band members take their comm@@ itments to the music group very seriously . the local press not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
&quot; once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you always come and play with shining eyes and play in the tur@@ f you learn day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , forest horn , ti@@ mp@@ ani , Bon@@ g@@ os and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from W@@ aste
&quot; more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically on the largest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments which are produced from re@@ processed waste materials : &quot;
&quot; music with prepared instruments made up of local firm waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where recycling works under the direction of Fa@@ vio ChÃ¡vez had begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate violin , viola , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets and trump@@ ets were produced . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio ChÃ¡vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musical teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , remembers the starting time : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where the children had known no music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
&quot; that changed when Fa@@ vio was somewhat shown , which he had never seen before : a native violin . &quot;
&quot; today , there is a complete orchestra which plays on instruments prepared on instruments and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic land@@ fill ) awards the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of waste every year .
&quot; those who live with him and of him are the stum@@ bling , like men in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectac@@ le of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .

&quot; these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can succeed illegal fishing successfully , &quot;
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that wild illegal fishing fights .
&quot; this entry , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental issues reported . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ issued in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices , will come to the common use of content . &quot;
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already been operated in Liberia &apos;s waters of illegal fishing before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were gradually cancelled and incl@@ ined , a law@@ suit of this species to their coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised quickly against the ship . they refused to share one of their har@@ bors and refused to share him a fishing permits . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the Premier was surrounded by countries that are simply refused , &quot; &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan f@@ isheries authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and persecuted . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; finally , it was forced to pay $ 2 million on Liberia for pill@@ aging of fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects against criminal practices and protects resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded by the N@@ RO Stop illegal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are among Somalia and Madagascar , six countries , who then driven out the Premier from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equal and working together . you can exchange information and stand each other for illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is captured , is hidden because of it is extremely difficult to track . thus , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate mis@@ ing existing laws , with which certain habit@@ ats and species are supposed to be protected , illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems , which have an delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; however , while actions against illegal fishing once were ham@@ pered by bureaucr@@ atic obstacles and also through the snow@@ y emp@@ o , with information between individual countries , the actions nowadays occur in real @-@ time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists existing licenses , news to susp@@ icious activities or details , which one can notice or experienced during a harbour inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , if they move on the open sea , by satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in banned areas - such as susp@@ icious driving routes - such as those that indicate a ship of caught fish on other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ide@@ al@@ case , such investigations can show whether the ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing connections , on the basis of this information we may deny the adoption of such ships in their ports . what means that ships can not be forced to sell their load , as in case of Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will then take significant financial losses for the owner , which means illegal fishing is fin@@ anci@@ ally no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Executive Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a Ber@@ ater@@ man that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
closed Front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD of lost sales in order to lose the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of Il@@ legal Fischer , which penet@@ rate eastern African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies located in the world of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these even those illegal fishermen .
&quot; among other practices , such actions count as sailing under false flag , fake licensing securities , speci@@ alizing in identi@@ fi@@ en@@ amen , fishing @-@ protected species and fish in nature areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are targeted specifically to use the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ mosquito @-@ organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; previously , a ship could fishing illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; You must not start my port &apos; . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and this legitim@@ ate conclusion seems to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
&quot; so far , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its foundation , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspected ships . &quot;
&quot; criminal networks are being exposed to counter@@ feit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities used , and it has found wing@@ ed ships and found it . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency to fight crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i may share information on illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far to the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to provide susp@@ icious ships more precise .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed further , helps to find illegal ships to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the Il@@ legal Fischer use very refined techniques to conce@@ al their activities and their location . &quot; &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , Head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a N@@ RO , which also deals with f@@ isheries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be used by satellite . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Cop@@ eland helps to build a system which links different informations ? it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ating ships with larger precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of afri@@ can nations actually take effect on the un@@ question@@ ably global issue of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos : President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth believes .
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the ocean protection organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of every tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of it , who knows what is doing - that makes sense &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and join her resources for the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run , with which a global system permits the tracking of ships . &quot;
there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities cannot only feel criminal but they are re@@ loc@@ ust@@ s .
&quot; ships that previously f@@ ished without a license sooner and hardly any consequences , we know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the F@@ ISH @-@ i participating countries have meanwhile increased a 33 % increase in f@@ isheries , since fishing boats increased more licenses since then . &quot;
&quot; when F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board sli@@ pping , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa will disappear several hundred million dollars annually by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there are six countries close to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force , too . they are now fighting illegal fishing , after exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; security is the aim of letting go even more of such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member land Somalia &apos;s first major triumph report : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag , and not only the ship was used without a license and have been banned by to@@ w networks that are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also enclosed in forbidden waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; said Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time , the evidence that such a special , collabor@@ ative working methods to protect the oceans really works in the entire world of sea .

they are considered protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela had rejected the opposition for the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ tians responded to the political and economic crisis in the country in which they assembled on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the withdrawal of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures from these demonstrations and arguments against them .
&quot; the debate will also be guided in other parts of the country - among others , in the low@@ lands of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central North @-@ eastern federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ as@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation in the country deterior@@ ates continuously , what makes the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an everyday life through an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition , in the office of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro saw the chance for a fundamental change ; however , the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of government regulation in this way : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the end of the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered to be the opportunity to rec@@ la@@ ze its institutional structures and close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the election of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round Table of the Democratic unity ) , in which the opposition would be joined to support the National Assembly , on October 27 , the demonstr@@ ators gathered against the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , and a march to Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace , the Venezuel@@ an government , should continue to continue on the 3rd of October . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter amongst others as follows :

especially great waves beat the news about police repression in the central @-@ north town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral , to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they could safely leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ State T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira . &quot;
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not carry a skirts because you could not see what many national gar@@ den@@ ers do not have !
&quot; meanwhile , a Inf@@ ographic is already doing the turn that forms the extent to oppression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship supp@@ ressed the land .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a counter@@ part in question - these have now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of numerous human beings on the streets .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities at La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said in the context of the large La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in CÃ³rdoba province against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined that were committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano is not looking for his life .
&quot; starting with the burden , same name as his father to bear up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he retained the family sec@@ rec@@ y for himself .
in the situation then I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret .
&quot; when a child has 15 years of age , you don &apos;t know that it is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I couldn &apos;t realize that my father was a thief , fol@@ ks and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in the prison La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppressed , who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities which he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows , which great power has a parent about his child , and how this child chose a way of redemption . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to join me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an ass@@ hole , you have been friends with the ERP system . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t be afraid that they will not be afraid of one day , and I must save you . &quot;
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back into the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
he told me I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that was fine . because so my father had moved me .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; all possible documents : University conduc@@ ts , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ da dr@@ ens the prisoners are tortured &quot;
my dad took me altogether four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time he commanded me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small , wrapped @-@ bag , and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that a large cl@@ ums@@ y silver was located . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard . &quot;
&quot; suddenly he pointed out into an open space , saying : &quot;
to practice the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I came in , and saw a couch , tortured on man . &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
&quot; later I found out that it was the end of the cable , the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there . &quot;
&quot; they settled a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , ski@@ pped him with water and pursued a load of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the tank there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty Win@@ del .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same od@@ our came out of his room . &quot;
&quot; I realized the smell immediately and I became clear , that the smell of a body is in need . &quot;
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can harm so much harm ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me the third time to work , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were har@@ assed . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian , who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses , on which naked human beings with the face down@@ wards - all were in hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people still keep silence on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; my father noticed that I saw the prisoner , he said , &quot; What do you look like , ass@@ hole ? &quot; &quot;
I replied , &quot; Why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; they were thrown into a dit@@ ch , and killed by soldiers and buried them . &quot;
I know this because my father told them at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed a man .
&quot; ( according to the survivors of the civil society Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was also charged in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , headed by the La Per@@ la Memorial , is headed by the former torture chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way you came in here is also the way , on which the discoveries came here . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the map , see that they took about this way and then tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned to a number assigned to the process .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came , that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father yiel@@ ded all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was later in the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war tro@@ op is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military emblem which one has fought against an enemy . &quot;

&quot; but if you walk into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... then it is not war , but V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always asked myself , like my father , who could join the head of security forces in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t get it .
I was also an officer at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything therein .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered : and you , whom you threw cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded , anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you stub@@ born . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
that was my father .
I have not the only good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of at that time , on whom I wore a jacket and a roller pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father out of La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he brought clothes with her home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence , accused me of being a wor@@ shi@@ bi@@ al of such crimes . I said , no problem , they can lay me to load what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway .
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ sc@@ ary act .
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if one has only children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a lifetime . &quot;
&quot; one has developed further , and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill . &quot;
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you were ex@@ cre@@ ted during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why use children ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they would have just been able to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not also have families who were transferred to their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ ical act which one can do to man .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was introduced back , they turned machines to eliminate the remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were destroyed and disp@@ osed of somewhere - no idea , wherever . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my father . &quot;
but anything remains forever .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the thought , showing my father , was created during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I made him accus@@ ations for all the abomin@@ ations , which I had to experience because of him . &quot;
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt out@@ war@@ dly and asked me , why the whole of patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &apos; Western and Christian emotions &apos; , they supposedly defended them , were actually well @-@ defended . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me what to tell me ?
I have seen how to kill people !
&quot; you have committed dre@@ ad@@ ful crime , and you were forced to join me as a child . &quot;
&quot; he only said , &quot; Now I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot;
exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I filed the first ad . &quot;
I finally knew he was a criminal .
nobody can dis@@ card me that I was vo@@ iced . I eventually said it against my own father .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magn@@ itude of the sentence .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera Process ended with crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 . &quot;
&quot; 43 Now as for crimes against humanity , he found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life sentences between 2 and 14 years in nine cases . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 accused died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , Tort@@ ure and R@@ ape by Office . # Es@@ war@@ p terrorism &quot;
&quot; all the accused were members of the military , including former military officers , former police officers and civilian . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidnapped and kidnapped by his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the court case is a historical milestone for all human rights organisations that have been working for victims for many years .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization , H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the process lasted more than three years , but research took 39 years . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO to &quot; more fear@@ ful auto@@ drivers &quot;
the sign with the transmission error in the Kyoto &apos;s centre where you can extend his driving licence .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
processing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Kyoto city of Kyoto , customers were able to extend their driving licence in which one can extend his driving licence in the last month of a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word , which means &quot; the older drivers &quot; means , the &quot; older drivers &quot; means to be fal@@ sely - but perhaps also with ar@@ mp@@ se back@@ grounds &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as a &quot; aw@@ ful motor@@ ist &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the wrong translation was on electronic ads from September 1st to 20th , on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself . &quot;
&quot; editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake had fallen to the interpre@@ ter Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also who made the local lo@@ ids carefully . &quot;
the Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n &apos;s publicly released daily newspaper wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult for older people and an international city as Kyoto &apos;s just un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; said Holmes . &quot;
&quot; the fl@@ a@@ wed English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; &quot; Dri@@ vers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; awesome car driver &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , even gramm@@ atically not entirely correct name &quot; El@@ der Dri@@ vers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto &apos;s police pre@@ f@@ ade ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , they declared that the error had already been included in the text , which they had been tested by trans@@ lators and that the translation was not tested on their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the exc@@ use :
&quot; we are very sorry that older people felt by the in@@ sufficient correction ( translation ) us , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News sat down with the phenomenon of the &quot; awesome &quot; older driver in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ oun@@ cing as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved , but quite a reason to worry . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by seniors . this represents a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , seniors finished 1.@@ 8@@ 03 from a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has sun@@ k in total , the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period increased . &quot;
&quot; the rep@@ utable writer did not appear in the version of the article comments on the light , showing the pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese apparently against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo , about the translation errors , received the following comments : &quot;
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; horri@@ ble car drivers &quot; ) about reality not ?
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a real translation . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in Asia
translation errors are widely distributed in Japan and across Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true mine for these bizarre bugs in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of trans@@ lators are mani@@ fold .
&quot; for transfer@@ ring , you need two major skills : passive language skills to understand the output and transfer language skills to transfer him into the target language . &quot;
the latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in case of native language . in general the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language .
&quot; thus , a French native speaker , for example , should translate into French into English , not by French into English . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a mother tongue , which could make translations into English . this may be due to understanding , cost , or the relatively small number of English speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that do not have foreign employees themselves , have yet to be made public . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is better than the best , become a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely distributed - often with funny results .
&quot; the r@@ end@@ able and en@@ ig@@ matic phr@@ ases that arise by machine translations , show that this technology can not replace yet a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English formulation in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints that are often used in t @-@ shirts or bags , are not used for sty@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood at all . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be un@@ acceptable or at least harmless . however , by large companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can see more careful translations . &quot;
the Kyoto city will hope to use a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protest and maintenance measures on the Internet and television
&quot; main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y So@@ c@@ ie@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , 7 April , Venezuel@@ an Internet users , that they would have no access to the online transmitter Viv@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users signed that the Internet setup of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV also wrote no more accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online broad@@ caster broad@@ cast@@ ed recordings of protests in Caracas , who were organized by op@@ positi@@ onal groups called Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was coupled , and recommended users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that website of Venezuel@@ an providers are closed again .
this is from the page of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers as Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in periods of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ itated by reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations were to report them with fin@@ es and closure if they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission continued this as a call to violence . &quot;
I have logged into @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national TV channels .
amazing that this continues to be cheaper than two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ e@@ tro confirmed later that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a blocking of the domain name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the Internet meeting their meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , reported that the local Internet providers can also use DNS . this is a technique used by the DNS servers of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server comm@@ ent@@ lessly or denied the request when calling to such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS sper@@ re : @ el@@ k@@ oli@@ ot@@ v @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ e
&quot; when V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday , 6th April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flo@@ res , who handed over the protests in Caracas , was taken into custody . &quot;
Flo@@ res was beaten and was placed in custody for police custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went again on show .
&quot; even though some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government is being regulated by Internet connections , so the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ers will always keep access to multi @-@ media coverage of the current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay many girls become slaves to slaves , to get an apprentices@@ hip &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and colle@@ cts witness of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo by Cec@@ ilia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly permission by Kur@@ d .
&quot; the following article is the shortened version of a report by Kur@@ a , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices , courtesy of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , slo@@ ping schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where they did not live together with the family , who lived there . &quot;
&quot; just before the university degree , she returned to the house once more and heard how the owner of the house full of pride over her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to work to school . &quot;
&quot; the shop is very simple : a large family with little money over their under@@ age son , or her under@@ age daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children have to afford countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and sacrifice of abuse and ab@@ uses , and all that can &apos;t stand up in the context of a contract which you can &apos;t stand up . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , these as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go described practice in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completion of their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she talked with Cri@@ ad@@ itas , especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go - collected testim@@ oni@@ als and den@@ ounced them . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call the things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , is generally not silent in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the family , on the other hand , is the family who shut up their daughter in faith to improve their position in society and can make something out of itself , to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand the family , which takes up the girl with themselves and just@@ ifies the exploitation by faith , that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise be no training , and maybe even was star@@ ving . &quot;
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
&quot; if the girl is har@@ assed , his family will experience many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experienced them .
&quot; in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon that is found in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , however , has a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of violent sl@@ aps . shortly thereafter , she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military belonging to Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official at the shelter .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small place with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ reira struck Fer@@ reira as long as a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n , until they suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of a young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported over the incident . &quot;
she emphas@@ ized that the murdered child was a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society of the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go responsible for the death of a girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest in protest together and demanded that there were no other Carolina in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; without paper , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the husband and nearly 60 civil society organisations required a breed investigation of the fall .
&quot; they want to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who was to be sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes before the court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n will be landmark , if the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go before Court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
&quot; Cri@@ ad@@ itas won &apos;t only be exploited as a workforce , they are also isolated from other girls in her age . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k worked in which her father worked to en@@ rol and her father lost his work .
&quot; their brothers now had to go all work and started selling sweets on the street or on the market sweets , to make money . &quot;
they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita into the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in their employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; thus she had to share the time so that you stayed time for learning , too . &quot;
she rose up every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
&quot; on Fri@@ days for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and disinf@@ ected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she finished with learning , the more leisure she had . &quot;
&quot; but this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employers . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had to be star@@ ving , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to bring more books from the library of the house@@ keeping as food from the fridge , &quot; she remembers . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the house master , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who had been in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; on some evenings in the House@@ hold Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , in addition to him and Editorial made from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince her , to grant the reports of the official media about the regime of dict@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; he endu@@ red for intelligent , but not kept with her . &quot; the house@@ keeper had found someone who spoke about politics as he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they were in mind that I would like to learn &quot; bad habits &quot; once again , that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who would hear that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who would speak to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would speak again their mother tongue Guar@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they were the education , which they had made possible again , explains them . &quot;
&quot; it was completely clear , however , that it had paid for everything they got from them with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discri@@ minated in the school . &quot; one thing , about which almost never been spoken , M@@ ob@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans that Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed if they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , is Cri@@ ad@@ ita . &quot;
I could not invite anyone at home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt especially clearly that I belonged to any group . &quot;
isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the Company Appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a fac@@ ebook @-@ group , in which we can view mer@@ gers for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s maid in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administ@@ rators of the group is Pep@@ a Ko@@ Å@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city bab@@ ou@@ in in As@@ unci@@ on district . &quot;
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
to learn .
please tell you .
&quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot;
the ad got five &quot; Lik@@ es &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ dest girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman who came from Ã@@ em@@ by , she also offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third commentary was written by &quot; a girl from the country inside , which would like to work . &quot; &quot;
&quot; then , the Constitu@@ tor of the display was once again a : &quot;
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again , if something is . &quot;
the shop was complete .
&quot; in the pro@@ log , Cri@@ ad@@ itas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long before ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history we managed to abol@@ ish systems like slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ada@@ z@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , who received the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ado@@ res , the women of Guar@@ ani and to their &quot; wives &quot; ) , read that many girls and boys will go back to a system of slavery in which they become a slight victim for abuse and exploitation . &quot;
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the vision of power are the key to the understanding of the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go .
&quot; bill is writing Egyptian users social media to register in the government , &quot;

&quot; sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections , recently voted a bill to have voted &quot; the regulatory declar@@ ations concerning the use and usage of social networks . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when he is accepted by Parliament , users and users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , then a place would be set up to share social media with citizens to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with adoption of the law , users would need to register their users in the site with their proper name and number of numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it be failed to do this , so that could be a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fine . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six par@@ agra@@ phs , consists of six par@@ agra@@ phs , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defined social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which is running via the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video files and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced if there is no indication of how Egyptian authorities are to make up the registration that the Egyptian government is not able to register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation at level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , member of the Parliament and members of the legislative situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall , which blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; that could mean that Egypt plans to judge a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit relevant information about their identity in order to access the network . &quot;
&quot; so far , it is not known that such plans exist . &quot;
experts and experts on site are sk@@ ep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; on the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R ) , the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ) , &quot; said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I have doubts about the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine how they could also control physical public and private spaces that could also be done online too . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , then it means that they may apply a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who require a approval or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of human beings and to bring them to a law@@ suit . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the legislative elections and the constitutional provisions before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his adop@@ ting and en@@ forcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating sc@@ ration is present on the image area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ k@@ y proposed a legislative state against cy@@ ber crime , which was intended for a life @-@ long prison sentence for those who were guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and to protest &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north @-@ east of Iraq , H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq began to protect the true Persian leop@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the Leop@@ ards that are st@@ ating through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to wild , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they always find less prey . &quot;
why is this particular kind of leop@@ ard so important ?
&quot; like R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard in the wild bo@@ bs@@ lei@@ gh is low , and continues to zero . as the team is in the video making it a recording of a large cat in the camera , breaks R@@ aza in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza passi@@ on@@ ately loved one other side of their country , which is not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programmes in Nature Iraq since six years .
&quot; since 2013 , she has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 , making it a protective zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 documented , launched for North @-@ nor@@ theastern Japan , daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made during the last six years to re@@ building the lives of those three @-@ fold catastrophe , tsun@@ ami and an atom &apos;s accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast pre@@ fecture with both the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced evacu@@ ated because the tsun@@ ami made whole coastline to disappear from the map .
&quot; the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture still experienced a nuclear accident that alone , about 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows the local perspective of which progress has been reached six years later in order to re@@ build the life of local rules .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building agency as well as survey results of the affected themselves .
&quot; the construction situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that , up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( which are only completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to list the largest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , and 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such homes , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima is the final light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; although still , six years after the disaster , evacu@@ ated by accommodation services ( which will be evacu@@ ated by Beh@@ el fs@@ u ) in definitive spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people had to live in dwelling accommodations . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima , and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , nearly 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hima evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated in 2011 was still more successful in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in the evacu@@ ation of over 75 percent of the evacu@@ ation of the evacu@@ ation in final houses . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the figure is at 34 percent .
the status of works and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by mis@@ fortune , their gates will be opened up until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures are far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of fishing airports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are back in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have re@@ opened its operations . &quot;
&quot; the tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land , attracted vast superf@@ icial . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of land destroyed only 690 hectares of agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , lying in the nuclear pl@@ ywood . &quot;
&quot; tourism has been re@@ covering in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , but again Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far off again . &quot;
the tourist tax in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent in the same state as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima in contrast can only be 75 percent .
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next great earthqu@@ akes ?
&quot; in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys among the indigenous population and evacu@@ ated under the evacu@@ ation . she asked them about the status of the reconstruction and also , as its conception has changed over the tsun@@ ami @-@ risk . &quot;
in their introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami consciousness under the local population .
&quot; the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , taking action taken in order to be prepared on future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents find that there is still not enough of disasters in disasters . &quot;
how it is to be evacu@@ ated out of the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
&quot; in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has intensi@@ fied its attention also to the position of evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima didn &apos;t only experience the enormous earthquake and the devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture was also witness of the worst , cat@@ astro@@ phic disorder , nuclear accidents , and Japan . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 evacu@@ ated out of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in early 2016 , there were more than 23@@ ,000 people back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima in a permanent replacement country . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 level , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima out of their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; most of the evacu@@ ated areas are evacu@@ ated in the disaster zones , older than 50 years old . they are still in proper understanding , because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima have to compete with massive construction projects . here , the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games will be held in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; if you encounter people from other countries , which speak a different language , the differences appear to be larger than the simil@@ ar@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one recogni@@ zes that more than it seems to appear at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they demand our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about speech and country borders . &quot;

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva on a widespread photo .
&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered week in the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer visited him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a striking cane against the head . nationwide participated millions of demonstr@@ ators at a protest rally against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal State University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skul@@ ls of trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors accredited him on this Saturday and then put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is critical .
&quot; the local photo@@ journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos from the attack on Mat@@ eus , spread rapidly within Brazil for a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , the face of the police officer will also recognize that , with a demol@@ ition attack , the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the completion of the incident carried out by the active service . &quot;
&quot; the pictures show the police officers , as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his striking stock to the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; would be a police officer from a demonstr@@ ators and landing at the intensive care station , would be his face for six months in television and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia divided by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ( recorded video on the web in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several sanitary shortly after him . &quot;
another video with the same scenes but from another perspective is also filmed in social networks .
&quot; in the shown below , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus down the 50th second . &quot;
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state of state , Internet users now have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) in order to stay part of the cost of medical treatment and allow to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is at the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;
against police force . &quot;
the drawing was divided several times in social networks .

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s in memory : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish from his father murdered , because he has been sabot@@ aged the Occup@@ y Movement in Sec@@ ond@@ ary School . and now we have been attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira , who has been attacked by a polic@@ emen who struck him with a striking stock . &quot;
police transfer
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police raid against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; polic@@ emen used protests at the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s protests in Rio de Janeiro , where protest@@ ers had a stage for speakers , g@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , the police asked via speakers to refra@@ in violence against protest@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again the Brazilian media prot@@ agon@@ ists have tu@@ cked up , making the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window fe@@ eb@@ b . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were targeted specifically on a bro@@ wn@@ ish glass windows to illustr@@ ate with a photo of their cover pages .
&quot; on the contrary , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set @-@ on bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic background , more about a broken window as above the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special issue . &quot;
this must also recognize if one stri@@ ve against any form of non @-@ damage .
&quot; here , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives a absurd , di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate significance , and the typical violent acts of the military police are disper@@ sed by head@@ lines with the title &quot; protest@@ ers on con@@ front@@ ational course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the loc@@ alisation of forgotten villages in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar mills in Cuba included the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a ) &quot;
&quot; the municipality of Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , regardless of that there is no significant sugar in the place . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were laid in the sugar @-@ tube factories .
&quot; after sett@@ ling the sugar industry in the area , the factory lost and after its plants , until only the smells of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
approximately 272 workers had to be re @-@ inv@@ ent .
some changed the work .
others signed and comm@@ utes to the factories a day .
&quot; N@@ ene , a Sol@@ dier Veter@@ an , who stands every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar industry does not smoke his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region of sugar mills , he returned to operation after a long time , because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he was not expected .
&quot; N@@ ene reminds you of having heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry is already resistance to pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , I@@ ne@@ ff@@ iciency , the bad administration decisions , and climate change . &quot;
&quot; production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the country for a couple of decades , but the bad appointments already have no news anymore . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane turned off ?
the old platform of the church looked even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
&quot; the reduction in the sugar industry was an economical necessity : the 155 sugar @-@ tube factories were technically dated , and hardly competitive , they were unbe@@ atable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production rate was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
&quot; they only left the factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) . &quot;
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ ves that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 through 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report &quot; Land@@ ing perspectives &quot; from the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate roughly $ 85 million for the country . &quot;
not everything was good
&quot; the day of today &apos;s day will bring security into the history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of re@@ organisation in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the dis@@ closure of a total of 98 sugar tubes , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the Sug@@ arbe@@ et Factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene is known as a soldier , he speaks of the closure of the factory , the word that he repe@@ ats the most , &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot; &quot;
almost all respondents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order to receive the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
the first letters started to come before the first movement year .
&quot; it was officially addressed to documents related to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister was able to appro@@ ve each order . &quot;
&quot; from there on , the responsibility was informed and the letters came increasingly frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was in charge for the dis@@ closed factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for which was still used in operation .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another complex , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved against his will at the dis@@ closure of the factory , whose construction he helped , took part . &quot;
&quot; in every part he removed , he made one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the best developed industrial area developed by Cuba and the most important work@@ stations was wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives for the work@@ places and services that were generated in the churches were created in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mamm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president in the eyes of those present persons , when he guaranteed for the opponents whose factories were no longer in operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar mills
sugar cane has been extracted only high since 2004 .

&quot; after two years the People &apos;s parish Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always to the better when one factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar be@@ ard came , or better said , when they began to edit it , they also heard it on , the road to asph@@ alted , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look up other factories . &quot;
they were to spare parts .
&quot; without future perspectives , many young people left the region once again . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even used to supply the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant remains imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene was back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; nin@@ ety @-@ forty appointments bring to the old soldier a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is not a bearing person , yet gives it the lies that they told him . &quot;
they have been pe@@ eled for ten years .
&quot; at the age of 65 , N@@ ene goes back in R@@ ente , not because it is missing in power but because he is bit@@ tered . &quot;

&quot; the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e @-@ communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will ensure that the young participants in talks on discussion topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , discussion , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or whatever their sense does come . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young@@ sters are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize a similar workshop with the tribe of the Win@@ neb@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ can@@ ada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were missing or murdered . &quot;
the cases were mostly not explained .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ o Cre@@ e First nation uses the motif of a video game to con@@ vey , as important to traditional customs and customs , despite influences through the glob@@ alisation . &quot;
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages even though the young people don &apos;t know the languages of the First Nations in the language .
&quot; in the following song , that Wh@@ ap@@ me@@ oo@@ g@@ i Cre@@ e First nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung in cre@@ ams . &quot;
the people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ olly of the North@@ stars hip @-@ Hop group that gave them one verse in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script as well as translation into English which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like no one ever interested in me .
&quot; but I &apos;m trying to go on earth for my days , &quot;
that &apos;s the day you will take our cry .
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
&quot; but I believe that we will rise to one day , &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow up and forward to our youth .
&quot; so , they can do so , for which the creator of the Creator &quot;
&quot; in the commentary part , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and add the verse in sil@@ en@@ code ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
in Japan plastic dishes not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; outside of a typical restaurants in Japan , with more than a typical restaurants in Japan . &quot;

&quot; in Japan , you can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers that is exactly on the menu , which is exactly shown on the menu , will be found near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ o san@@ pur@@ u ( which is served by any dish ) which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers can see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to manufacturing these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , there are a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes , who documented the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; most Japanese are these plastic dishes so usual , they don &apos;t even need them anymore . however , a new trend is transformed today in consp@@ ic@@ uous mobile accessory and other g@@ ad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; near Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the Blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ o san@@ to . &quot;
&quot; now in the special sale : new with plastic dishes , decorated with plastic belts , as shown at the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ igen objects , as in this case , refriger@@ ator@@ mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ k fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the essence is increasingly complex .
&quot; in this case , an ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel shell with seafood ) is transformed into a mobile phone support . &quot;
&quot; for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) , we found a good use as a mobile phone support . &quot;
we also produced this part in the Tokyo railway station .
&quot; here is an apple , which gives your mobile phone : &quot;
&quot; designed to look like an apple , using a not@@ ch for mobile , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing return to the county .
&quot; some mobile phone support and cell phone designer allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ au@@ ra and salmon are used , a popular t@@ opping which is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had doubts :
&quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appe@@ ti@@ ary form , for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant to surprise . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of mel@@ on ice .
&quot; moreover , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; more whi@@ ch@@ ile plastic dishes can be seen below : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # , which will take you on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # . &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trends , this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district which is devoted to the popularity of the restaurant industry . as for example , the sho@@ re@@ side san@@ to . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of battle against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media on the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug dealers &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mi@@ sts and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , this reflects not the extent of the human tragedy that brings together this struggle . &quot;
&quot; coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ ells , pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict entirely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , somebody looks at the dream or on the municipalities that have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind each bone fund in the centuries @-@ secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their wounds may never heal . &quot;
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico is called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; speaking with drug dealers &quot; ) that these victims should give a voice and stories by people who were talking to the struggle between prosecution authorities and cart@@ els .
animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime lets us not only fear our lives .
the effects are much profound .
&quot; for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and all communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
pain of victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ d@@ que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear lives &quot; ) tells the story about this story .
&quot; a main character is Guad@@ alu@@ pe , a father that searches for any weekend secret graves after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost her father at only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ phe@@ w . &quot;
&quot; Pri@@ est : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task that we have asked , to go and to the graves , after the people we loved to look for . &quot;
Guad@@ alu@@ pe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; he was going to be back on October 15th , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprentices@@ hip . &quot;
&quot; here is also my mother , who is also with me . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , they did not have income . &quot;
&quot; you are the insurance of my father &apos;s insurance , but they do not pay them off , because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
&quot; where should we get them ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; editors : why the project is so important :
we do not only need to show the faces of those who want to be afraid . we have to show the conflicts that show frag@@ ility and the sovereign power .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ AF , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post in Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that violence should never consider as normal , no matter what type they appearance : &quot;
I have already known a lot of illness and sens@@ orial journ@@ alism since a couple of years .
&quot; every day I have passed to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks each day and see the cover pages with pictures , which can actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel like if I &apos;m the only thing that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it seems like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the off@@ ender , when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , that is , as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear , that something happens to them too . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories to block numbers in a statistic .
&quot; the in@@ action of people is incredible for me , if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified that they were &quot; settled . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to agree , that they would fail from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still are still . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; &quot; Four months of ex@@ tor@@ tion in the main city district : as a family with threats issued pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; in this , she describes how armed crimin@@ als had taken money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business , but had torn their family apart . &quot;
&quot; you are thinking about everything you have lost and , as some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days . &quot;
&quot; pain never passes away , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , when you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed when telephone numbers are also changed .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
she graduated in words with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you do not know when they will guide you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , if we would dissolve my profound feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to weep . I must learn to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Kids of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of violence recorded . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions such as : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it possible to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Bryan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells us that he had to teach himself , how to make a egg boiled , potatoes , tortillas and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ acon with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells about the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
&quot; but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for one boy for whom all life of violence , and who had to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years earlier , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody ly@@ che of his father had been shot by armed men from a moving car . &quot;
&quot; Bryan was born in Bryan , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like : &quot;
&quot; Bryan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the existing social issues in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city of the world because of the number of murders according to the civil council for public security and government of the United States government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosecutor &apos;s office had 3@@ 103 murders per day . this represents 8,5 murders per day . &quot;
&quot; these are only some hundreds of thousands of stories , which leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the country &apos;s soul . &quot;
only few stories live in view of a new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ati@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project , whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug dealers in which the country has tortured in recent four decades in a comprehen@@ sible way . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is worth a thousand , un@@ true words &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r users Ni@@ kl@@ as Viking ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages on which he has left , include images , on which violence is represented . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to raise a rum@@ or , or to expos@@ e a fake . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years after the first time di@@ pped over the first time ? content in social media , whether true or true , incl@@ ined to continue to ins@@ ist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo seven years ago ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been used to have been used to test trage@@ dies that have actually been taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false head of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false description &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - den@@ ies not the fact that there are abundant coverage of events in the DRC , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
it throws questions about our desire to pictures on our desire .
&quot; what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo , &quot;
&quot; in 2010 , a tank carriage crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , the second largest country had been negle@@ cted for years and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became a dangerous path of com@@ b@@ ays that were difficult to drive . &quot;
trag@@ ically fell victim to the tan@@ ker trucks .
&quot; cal@@ ender representative described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ oped the dozens of houses including a movie in the vicinity , which was full of people who plays football world championship . &quot;
houses prevailed and ch@@ illed bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to un@@ mistak@@ able .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria &quot; . by Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the grey scenes this day . &quot;
an example is an example .
it shows rows of frozen body that surround the ground during people .
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years the same picture was f@@ ished several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real terms of trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on January 3 , 2015 Figh@@ ters Har@@ am attacked the ent@@ le@@ thal n@@ ig@@ erian villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on on 3 January 2015 . &quot;
&quot; witnesses reported dra@@ stically by atro@@ cities , before which they flee . &quot;
houses and shops were burnt down and car@@ cases were covered in streets and bus@@ hes .
&quot; reports were reported , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one went back to count bodies , &quot; said one inhabit@@ ant on Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were cut pieces , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only from satellite imag@@ ery , the following time could be illustrated . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army point in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again as it was fal@@ sely explained as evidence of the fact and the potential of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris two days . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ used use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of failure ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the image was taken as a cover for mass killing . &quot;
&quot; another step further , like this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange came also in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash message published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee were ra@@ kes , rape and some dead , some through burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported by violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following on which these descriptions were assembled with photos from the DRC : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from a Saudi Arabian news side , which in 2012 claimed that President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an is said to have participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to obtain this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , the AFP and their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ einer His statement , but did not have the image from the DR Congo in connection . &quot;
the global range of false data
tracks of these false c@@ rank@@ ings range back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; with a &quot; reverse &quot; picture search &quot; , you can see how far more information can be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; a reverse view of the search engine with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 images below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 344 images , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private sides , platforms of social media and community , as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded mis@@ reports , others have attempted to de@@ lar@@ v@@ ise the forg@@ eries . &quot;
&quot; we have entered examples of the ab@@ used use and associated with the respective countries , based on what side they were published . thus , we want to represent the range clearly than by the language only . &quot;
several examples of ab@@ used in some cases were also associated with each other ( in some cases ) .
here are some cases that can now be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
geographical sample of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange countries are still available on sites or servers , the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ si@@ ders are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in grey are examples , according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ feit examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Alg@@ iers and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; War of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this article , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City does not only refer to the bad notification , but also discuss the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions following the int@@ enti@@ ons of the people and the trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los c@@ rist@@ i@@ anos &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article on explo@@ sions in Northern can@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica is cited as its source the Spanish News Agency EF@@ E ( whereby not known is whether the original report contained the picture ) .
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; according to the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , like this one , who used the image from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; clearly no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster seen this . &quot;

&quot; Malaysia also offers two extreme example of an ab@@ used use of the DR Congo , on the other hand side of a blo@@ gger , the sympathy of the Nig@@ erian massacre and on the other hand to an blo@@ gger , the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya have been persecuted , because the photos were ab@@ used . &quot;

&quot; in Myanmar , the government of Myanmar released a correc@@ ting news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions with regard to Myanmar . &quot;

&quot; this post , who established itself to the members of the Russian orthodo@@ xen community , clearly indicates that the image of the DR Congo is NOT true to kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ a must have been in 2012 , that monks and politicians were involved in killing the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
&quot; the article was updated in 2014 , and at the time of this release , the picture continues to be contained therein . &quot;
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic near news page An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture was not taken from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it was a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ p attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the picture later , in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to ref@@ ute that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ d@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the image of the DR Congo appeared , signed up with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre and the port of Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities found these events , which took part in the name of the Islam@@ s , found a major attention . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
the picture was taken as proof for the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times weigh@@ ted ) . but the messages that were linked to nothing were taken up in no religious context .
&quot; instead , the aim of allowing attention to the relative numbers of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that was supposed to have been written by a &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; over the Nig@@ erian massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnamese and declared it to the Counter@@ message . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the image from the DR Congo was found , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; further confirmed examples of a defective use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( at the portfolio in grey ) are also not completely tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entry with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp exist on the web cra@@ wler and occasionally they disp@@ ose of picture names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the image ultimately insi@@ sts a proper description , but the original fee is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong topics or frames ( single @-@ frames ) , who passes these posts . the first frame is focused on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in relation to major discussions about the silence of Christians through Muslims or - in defence of Muslims - the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fri@@ day uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; religion Under@@ stand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth to investigate how pictures can be used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when reading these images can no longer be granted to faith . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are many people who have un@@ intended to share the amount of drinking water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of the false and false information , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ru@@ pe@@ ert it the actual horror of what actually happened in the DRC , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread for@@ cible pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that it comes back from pictures of a ref@@ us@@ al to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , care is that violent pictures reader and viewers disin@@ ter@@ ti@@ ze and give them the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , that function as violent media on it ) . &quot;
&quot; while there are some evidence regarding non@@ violent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; you &apos;ll need to worry about the situation in which a picture is somewhat sug@@ ary , which can actually be derived from the context or to completely mis@@ used type . &quot;
&quot; an investigation into false statements should , however , be considered as internationally as they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photography by Andy Simmons was used in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ ob@@ sol@@ vable ) stri@@ ves to offer professionals a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated .
&quot; such words exist in each language : you express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these un@@ mistak@@ able words are already well @-@ known ( as the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish braking ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly at each attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression does not satisfy , why a complete explanation , and sometimes somewhat context are required to understand what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected in an online list for a whole time .
&quot; most of these lists handle Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog , you will find the original words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - efforts to get your parents in recognition of your parents , as you have been trying for your younger years . &quot;
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ den language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , as follows : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth , which you feel after being caught in the sun in cold days . &quot;
&quot; in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words , written by his blog : &quot;
&quot; they grin@@ d other cultures , reveal different thoughts , and we@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of &quot; Treasure Languages &quot; being very appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka is the worst floo@@ ding in the decade
the island state Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and yield disaster in this decade .
&quot; the mon@@ soon caused by the mon@@ soon that starts at the end of May are caused by strong rain@@ falls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; following a position of the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ ate centre of Sri Lanka , 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundred people are missing because of the floods and s@@ lu@@ dge win@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe residence . &quot;
&quot; the ra@@ ins were gradually dropped on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water fires in some areas went back slowly . &quot;
&quot; health and hygiene ratios of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected , and still in@@ accessible areas . &quot;
the following pictures and videos con@@ vey an impression of the extent of the flood catastrophe :
&quot; high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water conditions of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am ants and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the high water situation . &quot;
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri L@@ ank@@ as fatal floods wor@@ sen the den@@ ces crisis , save the Children , after further rain@@ falls are already on the road . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da with G@@ alle also flooded during the last day of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations , and another five are made for transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants included in their flooded villages . &quot;
various organizations and start @-@ ups have also announced to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ I@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provides important information on high water situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
&quot; for all , who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims - &quot;
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
&quot; today , please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area . &quot;
&quot; the tax@@ er@@ aser app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ centre is informed . &quot;
&quot; last year following the disaster of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ anu , Pick@@ Me brought a &quot; high @-@ water aid &quot; key , which allowed users to pick up a vehicle for pick@@ up of assistance services and donations . these have then been for@@ warded to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ an Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; similarly , they led a &quot; SOS &quot; key , which included more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat strikes for high water and land@@ slides . &quot;

use approved . when in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love friend .
&quot; I confi@@ de unto her my four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
in the one minute we call par@@ ol@@ es for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; in the next channel , we are transfer@@ ring rights to trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head scarf , bound from an American flag , other channels against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my friend looks at me and says : &quot; these things do not affect you , right ? &quot; &quot; why , because I &apos;m not the Muslim ? , I wonder . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people , with whom I have been working or people who have been working for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; built in her introduction . &quot;
she was horri@@ fied me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different kind . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
this drawer is well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims as I do not fit there .
kidn@@ apping are becoming mi@@ li@@ fied
I don &apos;t get that alone .
that is even the poet that poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures are in mind if you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old how I was now he was an Orthodox Muslim acher and schol@@ ar .
&quot; Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in Western performance , religion was deleted from Rum@@ i , as well as the most popular translation of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reductions of Muslims ; the Western books have been pre @-@ colonial since centuries .
this temp@@ ting picture is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the landmark Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward Said broke the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures continue to stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood remains . &quot;
&quot; I have been working for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ ed sc@@ r@@ ents domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative overs@@ ha@@ dow the reality that in the last three decades of nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the United States could not even choose their first female Presi@@ dential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women have been hin@@ dered to carry out their head@@ scarf in public buildings and to cover Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which both are both sides of the same medal . &quot;
a powerful group exercises his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women to conduct movements for change .
it is also noticeable that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on an American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been ro@@ oted this way with slaves .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this narr@@ ative has occupied our collective imagination , deep and in@@ correct , that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ males and children become an@@ tim@@ ed attacks and ch@@ ic@@ an@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; because of this stories we tell and because of the way we tell you , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , the religion but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to 1.7 billion belong
&quot; in the news industry , we are doing more than only stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
&quot; we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives , who help us understand the world . &quot;
and my industry has failed to argue the sc@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and here we have failed , where seven million Muslims are representing the highest degree of religious &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim populations are African @-@ employed Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants originating from 77 countries .

&quot; four decades ago , my parents immig@@ rated to New York to live to their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue , and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers from New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh by name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan was rev@@ amped the world &apos;s Sky@@ lines , my parents were un@@ changeable Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I a failed Muslim and American woman now ?
&quot; sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of fet@@ ch my Muslim recipes or take my hand @-@ hand@@ ker@@ or@@ an that all Muslims apply to themselves - &quot; from respect for pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am singing , we do not wear all T@@ ash@@ enko with us . &quot;
we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected for an additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who make an effort to fight far widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies will be produced at the current band of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machinery with banknotes , think tanks and experts for counter@@ feit information which is already a faulty picture of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a fore@@ igner , who cap@@ tiv@@ ates a towel . &quot;
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the USA see below .

I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim , but I was only four years old when I was four years old in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientist describe religious life , they attack on the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are here . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf I think that I am the Muslim , when they could see through the 15 meters of concrete and air that our homes can separate . &quot;
&quot; she would see the sole rit@@ ual with my daughter , when I kept it in my arms , and her Arab verses to protect the Koran and the Qur &apos;@@ an . &quot;
I repeat each of them three times .
&quot; therefore , I pray that they are protected from evil , evil , which you can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging is the maternal picture of my grandmother &apos;s maternal side with her sisters ; as they win a competition of the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi for decades .
&quot; it is the image of you that I slept in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her complete and un@@ finished paintings , Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters you can almost rely on . &quot;
&quot; to be a Muslim , the prayers she said to me when I had a bad day . &quot;
&quot; to be a Muslim , how she taught me to relate to God . Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who has been colonial about centuries - through &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; , &quot; which has formed a company with the name @-@ called British East Asian India company , it has a deep meaning to call my lord the Lord . &quot;
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging , means to grow and to hear that men can not weep , but at the same time to see that my dear grandfather is crying . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books on the modern Islam and over the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana Ja@@ az@@ an ir@@ reversible around his family in India occupied K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he had not been able to close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know is that there are million Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have split the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;
&quot; the Muslim means to know that over the past two centuries , Europeans have colon@@ ised all to four Muslim lands . &quot;
&quot; it means , knowing that the first air@@ ed@@ itary ed@@ itary affair had been thrown over a century by a Muslim country . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time , Grand@@ father of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ish@@ ly sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was named as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he was the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before it was air@@ crafts , he travelled to more parts of the world when I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means remember@@ ing fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops that went on every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , to pursue mass destruction weapons that were non @-@ exist@@ ent . &quot;
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of war .
an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate amongst veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means to know that if a tragedy is home to the US and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story is recorded four times more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a released black slaves . &quot;
&quot; it means , that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar , called Bil@@ ali Muhammad , was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought to this country . &quot;
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel to fight as people over@@ filled the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .

&quot; an American woman , an Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim , a Muslim , a Muslim and a journalist , but to fail to mis@@ use them , but to fail to communicate to others . &quot;
&quot; the nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion is more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; &quot; against &quot; them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother , to take care of my child , and all the Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia consists of Muslim regi@@ sters , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama . &quot;
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it is in immigration li@@ aison officer , who takes up a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it exists in a country that closes his borders toward people from just the countries , which are bombar@@ ded . &quot;
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; which is largely driven by Arabs and Muslims .
&quot; it is the wars that we lead , and the bombs we cast on Muslim lands . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those who we do not tell us , we are here . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , North@@ western University participants showed a scientific un@@ real picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
conversation which we have to lead
&quot; we are too deep to reveal to the Muslim , or the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we stand for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the in@@ correct and dangerous prints that we state in our news re@@ productions . &quot;
&quot; at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to cap@@ turing our multiple of d@@ ash @-@ sigh@@ ted ident@@ ities and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the po@@ d@@ cast Lake Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ ler ; the po@@ d@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Bad@@ em ; the vir@@ al Vide@@ os@@ erie Secret Li@@ ves of black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sh@@ ust@@ s Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to multiply Muslim authors , and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American Super@@ hero - all this makes me hope . &quot;

but I &apos;m concerned because of this difficult global point of time in which we are located .
&quot; and this moment has consequences , that go beyond the 1.7 billion . &quot;
there is a reason for that con@@ spir@@ ators theore@@ ti@@ cian that existed in the dark corners of the Internet now the White House .
they grew exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they did Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , it had not been given them ; now they have large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the real@@ ities and the history , of whom I was not aware of how I was so old now , but those who now have made me to an illeg@@ itim@@ ate Muslim . &quot;
things I have left for a book in my speech here .
&quot; things that perhaps do memories are aw@@ aken , because in all the inter@@ section that our humanity is doing , a story can l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to another &quot; others . &quot; &quot;

&quot; why do I tell this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where is Edward Said , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people through creating the &quot; others &quot; in the public performance , four decades even Scientific of Stan@@ ford was . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions on the role of his , consci@@ ously and un@@ consci@@ ously the &quot; others &quot; ; as it was my girlfriend and I did not believe in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the idea that we have no pre@@ sidents in which we have no pre@@ sidents who have already broken countries and &quot; to other &quot; people , far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ ative art wants to preserve urban lingu@@ istic diversity
&quot; tell by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Daniele Rossi , using the CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license . &quot;
&quot; can it be a way to enter here , and now , despite a language barrier with somebody in connection ? &quot;
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the stories of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ voc@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain the language diversity of great cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not given to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; mass mortality of the world can be avoided , if we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces in which inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget , who they are to belong . &quot;
&quot; often , listen to it often is to understand &quot; be@@ ating these events instead &quot; to appreciate , to appreciate , to link . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers ask their story first in their own language before and transl@@ ating it into English . &quot;
&quot; although the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their de@@ vot@@ ion and representation is that the listen@@ ers of listening to it . &quot;
&quot; they call laughter and emotions , than the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;

Puerto Rico calls for the US re@@ constitution of sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a new examination by public debts of Puerto Rico , which participated in a mass demonstration on 72 million US dollars , took part in the capital building of the capital , and went up to Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n , in the old town of San Ju@@ ans on April 3 , 2017 . &quot;
this was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ da@@ d@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( the front of the ne@@ ural inspection of debt ) and the Ã@@ kom@@ en@@ ean National Assembly in Puerto Rico .
the princip@@ ality of the re@@ constitution of the debt have also filed a pet@@ ition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their call :
&quot; the Puerto Rico people demands that politicians , banks and government agencies , who are responsible for the debt , will be considered to be responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for financial examination and an open committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions equal compensation , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we will press and supp@@ ressed .
&quot; the people of Puerto R@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt , which is not their own . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king pension@@ ers .
we require immediate measures .
the island - not in the United States of the United States - suffers from a heavy financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico requires vast restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; the measures imposed by the outside imposed measures without the participation and conviction of citizens , to be rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; Night@@ watch for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :
demonstr@@ ators are preparing for the march .

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missed since more than one year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and his relatives continued his freedom and recall the contributions which he performed for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference of the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , dedicated to the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara RÃ¼@@ hl@@ ing , a publisher , produced by the so @-@ called &quot; book Spr@@ ints &quot; completed books , within three to five days , laser extracts from the book Cost : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ de@@ ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which has been published last year and is licensed here , contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is an homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it says :
&quot; this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge will be established , and what the real cost is to do with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , designers and writers who have participated in the movements for free knowledge have been working on page to see over the neb@@ ula which gives our news@@ feeds and create something for our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , which has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was kn@@ itted from the A@@ dra prison directory where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that , on his release , and they want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom . &quot;
&quot; as Bas@@ sel has paid a high price for his participation in free culture , many of us will start to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we today ?
what have we decided for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of tim@@ ely extreme trans@@ itions ?
the web developer of open source and digital activist has been held in prison since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military entity to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the military police Bas@@ sel had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it had been cont@@ acted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented himself as the insi@@ der of the Assad government and replaced them by an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
his residence and condition remains unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively participated in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in it to expand the access to the Internet and knowledge of the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologi@@ an and at the moment the ladder of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bass@@ els cultural prototypes was more pro@@ ving than the work , which he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the hub of numerous civil ties and merge Greek @-@ Roman architectural models with hi@@ ber@@ y traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bas@@ sel could not know that ten years after he began work with this work , the IS would put it all on this architecture , which not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world . &quot;
&quot; this expedition into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a period of time , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not yet close this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot;
&quot; when I call his name , I am overwhel@@ med . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ sel told me English , even as he was already in custody . &quot;
I learned to read and speak English well .
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone , who has asked . he taught others to read and speak English . &quot;
Bas@@ sel has opened my gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught others , as they use computer , at least theore@@ tically , without having taken one in her hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten auf ) , a committee which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in custody . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book a year .
&quot; they ador@@ ned the lyrics to him , when she visited him , and he translated it from the Arabic into English . &quot;
the book is available free .
book envelope by Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
&quot; it happens in every visit , &quot;
&quot; in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes , &quot;
&quot; so that I lose the mind in the moment , in which we embrace us , &quot;
&quot; no matter that any of the dangers are , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and guards &quot;
I forget the prison house .
and I am in every detail of your voice and words .
&quot; which I bear with passion , &quot;
if your eyes fail to say
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I returned quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to get back all the moments , &quot;
and over your absence to weep and to smile .
I testify about myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bas@@ sel , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote : &quot;
&quot; a year passes , my soul &quot;
while there is
&quot; I &apos;m in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bass@@ els history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Syrian regime of Bashar al @-@ Assad , more than 6@@ 5.000 people have disappeared from the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested or arrested by the regime , were tortured , or executed under non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; according to the International Human Rights Organisation , Am@@ nesty International has died in custody since 2011 at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians . &quot;
many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
&quot; today , we repeat our demand in hope that we must do this for the last time . &quot;
Mozambique : convicted of corruption and re@@ signed by corruption
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption , with whom a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence in the state apparatus , in which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 , together with four other def@@ endants , was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately demanded his return to the company what happened on April 19 then .
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evalu@@ ates the application , there would be no obst@@ acle to Cam@@ b@@ aza , when the company had not completed his old post @-@ trial procedures . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants are not good . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption , and clari@@ fies the absence of transparency and is even a response to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we have to consider is that the company should also have an disciplinary approach against the conflic@@ ting methods .
&quot; the company apparently , however , seems to have no adequate legal steps for the application of the respective functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mozambique social media , re@@ jects this behaviour as well as opposed to the case as &quot; contra@@ dict &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent , it would be a consultant after having been sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them lost . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating words , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is competent , he has agreed to integrate into the company , which he helped harm . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for his silence .
resi@@ sting !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ an and student of political science in Brazil says the director needs no mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the State , because he ins@@ ulting him , I can &apos;t believe that one has already insul@@ ted someone in such a way that the state has already been insul@@ ted so massive . &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza l@@ acks the mor@@ als and serve to the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state but only has helped itself on the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as a hand@@ ing of an in@@ exhau@@ stible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man &apos;s tired and eventually sentenced to a long sentence .
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remember the prime minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind you that a thief is in jail : &quot;
&quot; Die@@ be belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , Mozambique is not only to remain in memory as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , inter@@ sec@@ ting and - by the way , prophe@@ tic redund@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous represent@@ ations was , when he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious human being able to sell , even the father@@ land for its amb@@ itions , its own individual interest to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious human being changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he does not turn from his amb@@ itions . &quot;
an ambitious human being is the same at the same time .
&quot; in Twitter , reactions were also opposed to : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and came free . &quot;
&quot; and today , the company , in which he is Gel@@ der@@ sen@@ ed , re@@ signed under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ similar ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to wrong
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ a or spar@@ se .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ p@@ orted &quot;
&quot; according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to as@@ sign people with East Indian origin or in general as an ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; or the &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread issue of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radic@@ ally nation@@ alistic movements gave the word an extremely ab@@ orig@@ ination con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra nation@@ alists as hate against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &apos; today &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; usually may be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word is calling automatically to hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about its use of its use . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings which have the same accounting sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese too &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spher@@ es ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ ies A@@ ung Ka@@ at declared the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way , whether they knew how he could relie@@ ve his back pain by taking a word game . &quot;
&quot; the phrase &quot; &quot; C@@ ure &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that they should decrease in hate speech radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , however , also stressed that Facebook has to be analy@@ tic before introducing all the posts that sus@@ pic@@ ion in sus@@ pic@@ ion , rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filters the word automatically .
&quot; automation will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook . &quot;
&quot; what to do instead , is carefully analy@@ zing the mail and check it by checking the opposite words . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spher@@ es ) .
&quot; the good is that these dre@@ amt nation@@ alists , dis@@ semin@@ ate Hass@@ el@@ as , receive a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while action is a powerful signal to all might send them , the efficiency of this strategy may not endure long . &quot;
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that c@@ ens@@ orship of bu@@ zz@@ words often become a cat and mouse game where users can simply start social networks to express a new word or an alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ at described how Facebook began to extingu@@ ish his posts , when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned by the social network : &quot;
... when I was attentive to this new gui@@ deline of Facebook I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed .
&quot; ir@@ on@@ ically , my mail from Facebook was removed and I got the li@@ ken , posts and sharing of contents for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook community standards did not escape . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative int@@ entions or trying to show their views against the hate radical nation@@ alists .
&quot; Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without hate speech by Facebook .
&quot; in the post office , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism are bad in the country . &quot;
&quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more than the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to decrease rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
such words can only cause more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it appears as if it started this without local context or technical support , and so as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; Erb@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; have prohibited . &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they did not attempted to report the fal@@ sely dissolved Po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefit , which make them great sales , that would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship handed over for a lot of mo@@ ckery among the users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now do so funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ elt to see if their posts will be taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which were not contained in Hass@@ elt , but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and look at an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook contains the post office which contains the word Cal@@ ar .
&quot; screenshot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , heal humans ? &quot;
&quot; screenshot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alists who have used social networks have increased their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks shall be able to heat force in the communities in Myanmar in addition , particularly in the Rak@@ h@@ ine region , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
Facebook has been sent to his failure to critic@@ ise them of hate speech on his bur@@ ial sites .
&quot; but instead of simply the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better in current context rather on context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago finish with the chil@@ dr@@ ens
a wedding ring in the sand .

the chil@@ dr@@ ens before is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament adopted a law unanimously decided to forbid that practice , so that the married age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of sp@@ ouses , some members suffered from du@@ alistic and Muslim religious groups in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ persist@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , a group of representatives of the various religious groups in the country , said that the state could not inter@@ fere with the state that , age not maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened to the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contra@@ ctual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors of people under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; the statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 were 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Office of the Land confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 . &quot;
&quot; online pet@@ itions and social media movements that are stri@@ ving to abol@@ ish law for children before , followed by the base and rejo@@ iced with great support . without doubt she helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du guide , for example , had no concerns to tell the critics of the children before they should take care of their own matters . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition led to ten@@ sions in this actually imp@@ ly complicated matter and at some point there was doubts if the opposition would coinci@@ de with the bill of law at all .
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority decided to make him a law . &quot;
&quot; now , only the President of the country has to agree with the law and pro@@ claim the law . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update to the Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle again on Inst@@ ag@@ ram : &quot;
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill to be joined by the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes in the House of Represent@@ atives and not a single one .
&quot; after being decided in the Senate , then the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users was thr@@ illed because the laws have to be changed before .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s too much time and unnecessary rub@@ b@@ ish needed , but you know what ? the children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now and this is worth every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel , Jackson &apos;s opinion , it was definitely long enough to get the practice was L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally arrived : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent News ! &quot;
the adul@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who hears the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society that openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted : &quot;
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now is now independent from religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the amendment of the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es was today , on June 9 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; there are 41 MPs in the House of Represent@@ atives , and 35 of them were present at the voting . &quot;
&quot; all members , who were against the law , voted for the law . &quot;
the chil@@ dr@@ ens before is not legally allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ is@@ .@@ .

&quot; a possible hook depends on the shape of satellite Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ Organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; before months , Mahar@@ aj gave its intention to take a judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and it seems to be a ple@@ dge . &quot;
&quot; during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law said that it was quite righ@@ tly when Mahar@@ aj dict@@ ated against the law , the most social media users were des@@ irable , the debate on the subject would be different . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
&quot; rather , if we , instead of keeping the discussion so generally speaking , if we invite you to speak to the state in our bedroom , that the state , our daughters , protects against them that they might be ab@@ used for them , perhaps , would you be willing to continue discussing the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think it &apos;s not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a court case against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children are legal or even the norm , although there is laws , which they are under@@ going . &quot;

&quot; the Wikipedia side was presented on January 18 , 2012 , to the SO@@ PA ( Stop online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright legislation in the United States , internationally ac@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than one month Turkey closed the popular and based on the crowd sourcing principle based En@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
&quot; for day , more clearly , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and shared information . &quot;
both students and writers and fans of TV series fight against the blocking .
&quot; although many technologies are used to use websites to use block tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times ) that Turkey does not have the third largest VPN prevalence in the world , most of the Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been dra@@ fted by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been held since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most popular country in the world when it comes to massive c@@ ens@@ orship by Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , there are now several mir@@ ror@@ sides ( pages dedicated to the content of Wikipedia ) and are frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator computer connections ) , which is not based on the domain of domain name and makes a complete c@@ ens@@ orship . &quot;
the content is in@@ sol@@ vable in spite of the legal prohibition .
in a blog@@ post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we heard the news ( via the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put all that snap@@ shots of Wikipedia put on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed way . &quot;
this can help the users to check at least all Wikipedia articles even if they can &apos;t reach the www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ .org website .
&quot; IP@@ FS also stated that this step was conducted independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock . &quot;
&quot; Crist@@ ian Cons@@ onn@@ i from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ pal@@ pe@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror@@ side of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to get similar Mir@@ ror@@ sides when in the respective country of Wikipedia is locked out . &quot;
&quot; Cons@@ onn@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices , member and employee at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast : &quot;
&quot; it is not complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a Mir@@ ror . &quot;
&quot; you access to another URL , which is not the original . that what you can see is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially the server is leading the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia himself when these are locked in Turkey . &quot;
because this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey .

&quot; a straight rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around himself , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned moti@@ ves and washed colors . &quot;
the motivated him to carry him a camera and try to gr@@ ate the situation .
back then he was a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar to bring to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his home town directly next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to the Nep@@ als wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook as this first @-@ not@@ ch situation in his work helps :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world of natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river would be an Leopard .
the river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father observed him , and showed me the place on the other river side , where the leop@@ ard was found and I immediately started taking pictures to tri@@ p@@ ses ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar calls a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious as they look like .
&quot; and he should know it , because he saw Tig@@ ers face to face toward face : &quot;
a tiger may not distur@@ b oneself from the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I was too late because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the King of Bu@@ he@@ k appeared . he immediately sets out , we look forward to seeing you through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! ! &quot;
to promote the protection of wild animals is Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) to his photos .
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als nature and wild animals is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and lived mostly in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ter in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and live for six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist information . &quot;
see below some of these photos .

&quot; this entry was posted by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India . &quot;
an revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid greatest care , to pron@@ ounce their husbands or even of older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h until Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect her husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should pay the norm to preserve this practice . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian state of O@@ ug@@ a by an international tribunal and contra@@ sted by their family and the village community , after having a married relatives with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives can not be called by name , is also common among men . however , they have far fewer assign@@ ments to worry if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in Pun@@ e district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health personnel , well as house@@ wives , a unique club , thus quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place only for them , to discuss and discuss the in@@ ties of Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; one of 56 clubs , who exist in 13 Indian states , is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is concerned for the mining of the Patri@@ arch@@ s . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of their vide@@ oc@@ am@@ era at the discovery of practices , such as children up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS In@@ infected , and heads these clubs . &quot;
it reports how these clubs have created a secure place for these women and made them at the same time as ambassador of the wall .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini displayed in her discussion round , was one of women who do not call their husbands in their names . &quot;
she decided to decide on this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
&quot; to address the name of their husbands , a brilli@@ ance must have been charged to resolve all duties and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman , who does not hold this , is regarded as a mist@@ aken , as woman without moral . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never heard ourselves up to this discussion round .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had also called her husband , was never named in the name , tried to try out how it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end .
&quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him by his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in our luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , were protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to take discussion with a practice in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy , irrit@@ ated , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked them , &quot; &quot; If we cannot say the name of our husbands , but they may call us how they want us , means that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years , and this was the first day to whom she brought the name of their husbands over the lips , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ c spoke out of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the centuries of centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women to speak of their husbands &quot; name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she only turned down throughout the exercise , and another decided to release all the fru@@ stration against him and his family , putting him cursed . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
&quot; even in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ ople to have broken up with an ancient fires , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to call their husbands at their names . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop to say his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the entire family .
&quot; she was afraid of her mother in law , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it .
a husband of attendance in was less understanding and the situation art@@ ete in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of interest red pun@@ c@@ ce on the forehead , which indicates the marriage status : &quot;
why do only women show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the cin@@ ch red dot if it would also do it . &quot;
&quot; he laughed only and I listened to him , to carry him . &quot;
&quot; the other women did not completely ceased , but they mean , they are now in a better position to choose himself , not to carry him on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the Disc@@ ussion lu@@ b is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; we make a trip at every discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to worry about women , who could hear what could hear , &quot; says she . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days in their lives in their lives . they d@@ anced and sang about things about which they had never thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working with these problems for so many years and yet , I have also talked about some things , such as our ident@@ ities to our husbands , never so frank@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; it feels great , certain things to say , no matter how small they happen to one . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of glory and how it is connected to clothes .
some women in the group have carried out sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most , this is okay , but some wanted to have a sage c@@ ta , a wide Hem@@ an over a tro@@ users ; they have not dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of dispute and discussion on the advantages of their own dress code , mor@@ als associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , Con@@ ug@@ gel@@ te Roh@@ ini her own pair of Cur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that women could bear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will be able to create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether in the five months since her first discussion of discussion , Roh@@ ini confirms that things come slowly into the rolls : &quot;
we have made little steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then we stopped to say the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some of them , including me , do not make it , but only if they are alone and not other family members . &quot;
only one or two still say the name of their husbands ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ y on their forehead .
women in the discussion team know that the changes they want to reach in their lives - like the line to reach more freedom of movement or the own dress code - at the end of a hard to navigate .
&quot; by giving themselves mut@@ ually self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I &apos;m also there .
&quot; but this club , each of us , gives us the confidence that something will change . &quot;
&quot; and I know there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , if every woman goes home to the club and tells anyone about what we are talking about and what we do . &quot;
we all sit in the same boat .

&quot; a new system of de@@ duction of young people for the Organ@@ iser , presumably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , wor@@ ries the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations into life to stop the intern@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed : and some of the organs were taken from .
&quot; two men were arrested and subsequently , in succession , it stood that the organs of Sh@@ am@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used . &quot;
&quot; it will give the local super@@ st@@ itions that the head of a bald man &apos;s gold contains gold , or wealth , declared the BBC &apos;s polic@@ eman from Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia to the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks were registered on a bald men in Mozambique .
another group that is aiming for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 launched a mission in the South African country to investigate these practices .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring countries of Tanzania , where the authorities developed campaigns to fight these super@@ st@@ itions and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who have advanced to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men , who are traveling to Mozambique are goal rit@@ ual men in Mozambique are the aim of rit@@ eller attacks , warned the Muslim police following their body parts due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the surveys took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ b@@ ane in the south of Mozambique said that the local police have already said : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the Sh@@ aman are involved in the death of the faithful men .
&quot; the persecution and assassination of faithful individuals for the extraction and sale of its organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , has also given cultural moti@@ ves and is provided by the traditional Sh@@ am@@ ans on behalf , which also stated that a faith exist@@ ent , according to the victims in the head , the wealth of wealth . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men have been murdered with hair problems in this part of the country . &quot;
Angela Fer@@ reira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the poor s@@ na@@ i@@ ppa on Facebook that suggests that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty that Mozambique is opposed :
&quot; I would like to see GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , DAS S@@ ME , a country in which the teachers would be ashamed to demand sex against good notes , and other achievements , a nation in which people would not hurt nor any other things to get their lives or &apos; black magic &apos; , which aim to aim at to get car@@ essing wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the sin@@ cer@@ ity of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for ma@@ kab@@ ren humor were allowed to escape . &quot;

&quot; free Bas@@ sel : Ne@@ ti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous threat , December 2012 ( in English ) Nine reactions of international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and dis@@ sident Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia which was probably done recently .
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version is released as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sidents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community attention when his lawyer had been announced at the end of June , that he has been hosp@@ itali@@ zed for liver cancer in the final stage of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( stat@@ ute ) after completing his draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that the democratic reforms in China has taken part . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred the case as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and a speaker tells , he considered it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Liu X@@ ia , release or permit a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have crit@@ ici@@ zed the strict treatment of Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely out of the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has merged some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June , Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu &apos;s case . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man , however , refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to facilitate treatment abroad . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norwe@@ gi@@ fted Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came into the Sto@@ cks after the Nobel Peace Prize was rewarded by Liu in 2010 , although the Norwegian Government decided that this ultimately did nothing with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement for salmon exports to China , since the exports were largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hopes to an unconditional release , and invited Liu to take his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to oppos@@ e his prize . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to liber@@ ate Liu and his wife promp@@ tly free from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , who demanded the release of China for the release of Li@@ us , as she announced in an explanation on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we are expecting all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they are to meet and receive all visits , which they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States
&quot; US Ambassador of Terry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans would wish him to ask the possibility of the treatment abroad , in@@ subject to it with his satisfaction . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary El Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AFP on June 27 , that the message sent to the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the request of the US embassy attracted a mad response from China , with the declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country have the right to interv@@ ene and ir@@ responsible remarks concerning Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as travel irrit@@ ation and access to the medical care of its choice , which they have to do according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in the Congress to release the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditional . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to release the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , so that he can go to a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;
Germany
&quot; on 3 July , Berlin , German government speakers Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote that &quot; &quot; all the medical assistance is that he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg . &quot;
previously diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns if the vort@@ ex could overs@@ ha@@ ze Liu &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um invited China to provide a reasonable medical care to provide Liu &apos;s adequate medical care and to give it a possibility of reducing his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told you that Li@@ us Ms. Liu X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police have always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to contact someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak to contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
&quot; Canada calls for China to uph@@ old his international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , to preserve the rights of these rights . &quot;
France
France &apos;s foreign minister urged China in a statement on 29 June to release Liu from humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he , regardless where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; despite the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information that France should end up ultimately . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the Com@@ intern affairs in Taiwan invited China on 27 June to show Liu &apos;s release and a greater tolerance towards those who require peaceful resources to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ esische Legisl@@ ature Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u from the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress party demanded China to allow the sick of intellec@@ tuals to cover themselves in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very concerned in an explanation by Liu in a statement that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Liu :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives that he took and was strictly punished for which he had led strictly to a more harmon@@ ic , stable and wealthy people , which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; personally , I felt very moving and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or countryside ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be considered in Singapore as a city .
a debate has caused a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the meeting of the international branch of the Association of New York , the Minister said that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
it supports that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; that &apos;s it , with most people go wrong . &quot;
I tried to explain that we were different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to defend the logic in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian order in Singapore .
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ ing , this valuable land , you will say that we ultimately won &apos;t be a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory injury . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; they were not very no@@ bel by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of what he appeared un@@ ob@@ structive . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco , or New York , equally cities that become permanent by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as you reach the key point of the subject , again the good old suffering from the author@@ itative Mach@@ th@@ ers , the forward Democrats , left the ver@@ ti@@ fic@@ ated logic , since it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final week , during the last week , Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am gave answers to his American guests on our press , our Ju@@ di@@ k@@ ative , our political system truly non @-@ answers . &quot;
respective questions can be ex@@ iled with non @-@ responses r@@ ational style .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am on his opinion , because they did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our advert@@ iser K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take on the effort to clarify this point where it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; as An@@ on published his comment on the blog , he shows concerning the critics that it should start to understand the entire participation of the conference , in order to understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &apos;s statements , according to those Singapore would be a city and no country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ avo@@ id@@ able , even if we are looking forward to free and fair elections . &quot;
he reached Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party a party ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore is not a country , he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment over Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am who acts as a leader of a growing generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice had said of Singapore was very confused ...
&quot; at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old yar@@ n , which awaits me - was I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure whether he really believes that he is def@@ ending . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ covers the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ams arguments :
&quot; Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am has committed a mistake , &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ scher ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we will only be considered independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country the sovereign rights of the city Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique and it &apos;s equally land and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role within the government of government , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they only defend their city ? &quot;
who has to pay our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the Journey of a Dec@@ ade for the affir@@ mation , Singapore is , and was always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this proposition seems to have a lot of people to have off@@ ended ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we &apos;ve always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear such statements such as the defense of the country above all , etc . , but that is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather talk of the defence of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked short of his editors : what is the most abuse in your residence or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series to be exposed to certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is asked to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; reply I . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; ever since in what situation occurs the conversation , it is polite to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by presenting personal questions . &quot;
&quot; then the standard answer follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature . &quot; a lot of Canadi@@ ans may cook inside with anger , but if they are held for Americans , but not b@@ other@@ ed me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little who distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans become Canadian flag well visible in their back@@ pack , if they are traveling . &quot;
everyone loves Canadi@@ ans .
by the way Americans ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le sheets on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gay couples have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are polite .
&quot; obviously , we are often saying that &quot; exc@@ use . &quot; &quot;
Canada is supposed to be considered the toler@@ ant land opposite ethnic groups .
we are not as such types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I found many American friends who I ad@@ mi@@ red very much . &quot;
nothing would amount to me if you would like to change Johnny out of Dallas .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first , referred to as &quot; nice , &quot; is basically to be mir@@ ro@@ red - like the ben@@ evol@@ ving , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders of &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would be in fact a step forward . but the actual problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality is . &quot;
&quot; there are no edges and corners , nothing else you can encounter . &quot;
&quot; be harmless , it means un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting to make attention . &quot;
&quot; that can be something good , if one wants to stay un@@ noticed in the background , fer@@ na@@ b of the things that happen around one way around . &quot;
&quot; I would even come as far as far as to say , that the desire to be free and alone to be a major ar@@ ader@@ ie of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own matters .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders are described as &quot; nice &quot; , maybe just cool courtesy . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans do not talk about the fence across the fence .
&quot; we are missing the warm @-@ heart@@ ed , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our Prime Minister visited Canada just too sexy . &quot;
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ des Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a music video published in Thailand has published a music video which took the jun@@ ta to restore the jun@@ ta in 2014 , and in spite of its promises to restore civilian government in 2014 . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who explains how his friend does his girlfriend .
&quot; although not politically , music video refers directly to the tou@@ gh@@ ing military power of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other websites for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
&quot; in the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook ( 1.@@ 254 times ) and received 8.@@ 800 Lik@@ es . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists trained the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular , acting as with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at the videos of the videos , which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand have har@@ assed during the last three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section of 44 of the provisional constitution , which is given to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army &apos;s absolute decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme for the &quot; &quot; creation of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians , and other people who are regarded as critics by the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal law , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to rep@@ utable activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army which monitors online content and persons who was accused of having def@@ endants the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand is a stri@@ ving law against &quot; l@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic en@@ ins@@ ult ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later there was a coup of the Army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to purchase is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , even though security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax . &quot;
&quot; in the video , even as people are thrown into a black v@@ ans , before they bring them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they allegedly causes &apos; confusion &quot; &quot; in society and that internet uses long pen@@ alties , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; the Te@@ aser of the song presented the songs of the band , which was awarded the &quot; &quot; Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; , &quot; which was already used by p@@ utsch against protests during the 2014 protests . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the viol@@ inist cities in the eastern Capri@@ vi Region

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and is published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society re@@ covers only very slowly in East @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ian war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ car@@ cases of Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; several ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , kill @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in the Soviet area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the biggest part of Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area . &quot;
these settlements are also called the viol@@ inist cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
&quot; during the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these viol@@ ins . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the population was over 16,000 people after it had barely increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , approximately 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a result of the war , &quot;
&quot; the empty five storey apartment blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ k@@ schu@@ ko@@ w@@ kas , stands symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are fallen and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance to the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elder man .
he starts a conversation and it becomes hard to finish this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is nevertheless unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable spl@@ endor buildings .
&quot; the people , who once lived in this place and resi@@ ded their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have left the district . &quot;
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ers , which accommodate one or two families , recogni@@ zes the balconies where it is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; as they discover me with the camera in their hand , they withdraw immediately . &quot;
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to let us take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she just banned it , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers their girlfriend something and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultiv@@ ating land@@ sc@@ aped products ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming . &quot;
it is difficult to come over the laps .
the district administration is free of candles for free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build the cour@@ g@@ ettes &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left to aband@@ on Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ies , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial assistance from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she gives . &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; if holidays are , we visit . &quot;
but we cannot do that - everybody is dealing with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls her aun@@ t G@@ alya her . &quot; they said , we could build up cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build the cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ in Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and her five common children in her house for a few days .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war started .
every day they reminds of the thorn in front of the war .
&quot; despite the relatives who live in Central rus@@ sia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the Land Ab@@ i Asia broke off ) , they didn &apos;t have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ ash@@ as nursery was once located , they hold pigs , cows , chickens and h@@ ens . &quot;

you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it actually has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived like it was right . &quot;
I remember every day how the city and the war were once .
&quot; as our conversation with the end , a little boy is running us over us . &quot;
he runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
&quot; a ball flies out of the window , and another boy hun@@ ts him back . &quot;
&quot; he plays with the ball , which roll down the hill . &quot;

&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones to the falling buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which care for in@@ descri@@ b@@ ness in their lives . &quot;
they do not know differently .

&quot; this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 at our partner PR@@ I.@@ org . it has been published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants , who cross Europe or Latin America , some places will be known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula he is located at the border of Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is managed by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin a small woman with a pink @-@ pink spectac@@ le frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in ted@@ dy bears form .
&quot; she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , and grew up there . yet , they know many among the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is the fact the fact is that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for approximately 2,50 Dollar the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bal@@ ances , br@@ ittle walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for hotel - but hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an immigrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells , people come in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast to call it : &quot; m@@ um Africa ! &quot;
where are you mom Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; currently it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some of them already slept out on cardboard . &quot;
she wants to refuse anyone .
&quot; she helps them also and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them medications that they cannot pay , they provide them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived in a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was a reasonable first name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; the family of Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jog@@ ging mou@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ on Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; the family came from Angola to Brazil , hoping to go to Boston . &quot;
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel it suits her , since African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and her three children . &quot;
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are on the way to the United States to make regular a first stop in South America and then go towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other pioneers of m@@ um Africa . &quot; m@@ um Africa is a well @-@ known name at the circuit , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans were already speaking on What@@ s@@ App of Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companion , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction workers on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the football World Cup . &quot;
&quot; as the Brazilian economy weak@@ ened , he started his journey into the United States . &quot;
&quot; since months , he has been guest at Mama Africa : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to purchase the bus to Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I ask him if he will contact us in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; mom Africa is our mother and we never leave them again , &quot; &quot; he answered with sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they went on to post them or to report about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark hope for migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a cu@@ l @-@ asse leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken refuge in their small house . &quot;

&quot; he started to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived for three years , he was sent out to a raid on his office from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that in Honduras with his wife and his three children fled to people who wanted to press money without a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a well @-@ known , an all @-@ looking , offered him her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa all is full of guests .

China : X@@ in@@ jiang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on its mobile phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users , &apos; : &apos; more &apos;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ in@@ jiang , an ethnic min@@ orities region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their cell phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the cell phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile pf@@ one , which it indicates the District government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; will allow access to access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities decided to use the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app shortly after they had exchanged the app . &quot;
&quot; the police report that the app would determine the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection rating with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , Trojan and Ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware how much time they spend online , and to remote control their own home network . &quot;
&quot; with the filters for min@@ ors , this app will help children develop a healthy lifestyle . &quot;
&quot; of course , an app with these functions can be used in many ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; control unit or even h@@ ack@@ ers capable to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while talking about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger towns in the east and south , the reality is very often no@@ zzle for those who live in remote , urgent ethnic minority groups like X@@ in@@ jiang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ers and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ iss@@ ing Internet . &quot;
&quot; the Media Out@@ let Media Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China , &quot; which published cen@@ sored news in China , showed photos of a chec@@ point where police officers were random@@ ized to check out whether they were installed the monitoring app . &quot;
authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure the people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ App .
a mobile notification demanded that the people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a chec@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned by up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; they are forced to use the people , intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of captivity by the growing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; in addition , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from the state of China , which is highlighted by the software that the software can lift up a Windows operating system , so that the software will receive unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones are stored in X@@ in@@ jiang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council , to minim@@ ize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all government branches , authorities and allied institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the direc@@ tives of the Cyber@@ security Office in operation of their computers and communication equipment . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American Human Rights Organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ in@@ jiang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation of all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media storage cards are registered at local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and anni@@ hil@@ ate any of &quot; terrorist videos &quot; but this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives it pen@@ alties for a number of other possible publishers , including such that relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or death : part 1 : all cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane will depic@@ t his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ st that you are completely alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has dissolved after and dissolved , and revealed a truth , which is clearly visible both from inside and outside . &quot;
&quot; one , who makes all the glory of her name . &quot;
one that is crushed in a list of emotions and expressions that will not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you look back into reality and looking behind the scenes - beyond the actors , the beautiful scenes and the perform@@ ers - turn the characters in essence of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt solve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth are moving on the axis of the cal@@ am@@ ity . you will clear that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them are your grand@@ parents , stone by stone . &quot;
&quot; you have arrested me and my father three times , but this did not attain it , so that I form@@ ulate &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the Security Office it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he presented his power over us by giving even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn down during a peaceful protests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our Revolution .
it was enough to make the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all quarters were cov@@ eted , but only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , mot@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is cr@@ ammed up to the arter@@ ies with state security and their ac@@ compli@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a so@@ othing effect after the power supply stopped in the quarter . &quot;
I broke the silence while I cried out several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house shelter .
I heard my voice through the st@@ illness .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt cour@@ ageous enough to come together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we stayed with a glorious picture that filled my expectations and fully fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you free the Spirit from the Lam@@ p , but it is simply not interested in barley . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low , nothing can return to you , after you have seen it all the way to the office of the security service out of the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , my father was already there , as I am . &quot;
&quot; Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me hear me as you are &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are just brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not near . &quot;
his eyes filled his eyes on me .
&quot; and you shall tell you what to look into the eyes , and not go to the ground . &quot;
what I did so did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old . I was the fourth time I stood before this building .
&quot; perhaps it was on my fool@@ is@@ hness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure , when I answered , &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice over yesterday . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped to look to you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation , which could have had a fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word from what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary , and his father is equal with it . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal with it . &quot;
the smell of this curse movement is mine to me in the nose today .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture which I was exposed to months . &quot;
I went through the farm .
&quot; in the first office , I will leave everything I carry with myself . &quot;
afterwards by the farm and into the second office that leads through a speed to the single cells .
I take care of all details exactly before I supervised the room .
&quot; otherwise , they have allocated a bigger cell this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoners and may immediately put me to wait , without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after some minutes , felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I hold on a well @-@ proven communication method : with the fist on the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell was a &quot; Er@@ sin@@ Ã¤@@ ft@@ ling &quot; .
&quot; after long hes@@ it@@ ating , he ultimately answered me . &quot;
&quot; apparently there was a prestigious male aged old age in none of the surrounding cells , which is similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , there are no distinctive facial features , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like me ? &quot;
all answers links its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
investig@@ ators had insured me . they would be joy@@ ful when I stay .
LÃ¼@@ g@@ ner .
&quot; I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these forces , which l@@ acks fruit in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ am . &quot;
&quot; it must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always at this time the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black the color of the per@@ dition , until I presented the yellow light that told us the horror into person : the ja@@ ad ( such as : &quot; th@@ unders , &quot; playing on the 13th point of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be questioned .
&quot; thus the secret was revealed : to protect the State Security in front of us and to prevent the terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wit@@ e dial@@ ect - and they played the strict vision of their world view in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ e dial@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse , which they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ ans into one hero . &quot;
&quot; I look at the hearing space and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes before me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the expressions that gle@@ aned : &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start making this day@@ time with your life as you can see this to@@ day@@ time and protest at an end , anyway . &quot;
I did not answer .
I didn &apos;t get used to answer it .
&quot; I can really say no more exactly , when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes become after a friendly conversation with me for an ordinary communication tool . &quot;
when and how that happened was in@@ significant .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to be punished , even though I had done nothing to make this punishment . &quot;
to serve in all its diversity .
his command is to pl@@ uck me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession &quot; .
it begins with a plastic pipe which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker insp@@ ires your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you can not keep your cry . &quot;
&quot; my cry is not enough for him , so they ex@@ er@@ ted the pipe by a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first ceremony , I asked whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector , or whether it belonged to normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables in each other to present us out , from their view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour , three of them rarely changed when I was still in the line . &quot;
I had lost all my mind in my body - and my voice so I listened to scre@@ am .
&quot; the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling , and found no pleasure in it , which is why he was next to a electric @-@ charged staff . &quot;
&quot; electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my whole quarter . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power manager . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
&quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had his duty for this night . &quot;
it must have been at midnight .
I decided to lie down again ; let &apos;s say that this was my only option .
&quot; few hours passed , who came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light meets the space &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I reply with the voice of an exhau@@ st@@ ive young people : &quot; my lord , my father must make fear@@ ful wor@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and get away , you &apos;ll be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they were always released .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib was smoking a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib she@@ ds most of his time inside , and he sign@@ posted on his screen to his computer , to his computer , and again too his couch . &quot;
&quot; however , what one can rely on , is a cigarette between his fingers , or his with nic@@ ot@@ ine spotted lips . &quot;
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has been part of the West Bank since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel saw his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had forced to flee from her village in Palestine as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( about : Farmer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ ib is a passionate activist that has been transferred to the conservative majority , and is asking her well @-@ approved opinions about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression of opinion of art and rap@@ es@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics such as orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian ge@@ aring , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics cannot be found only in his hom@@ etown of Amman , but also in cities that from Damascus , to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ ib was looking for itself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking , and he can also suffer from their own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not make it openly , he swe@@ eps against the American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ ib shows his art in his studio in Amman .
taken by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib did not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to do in war zones , something with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian ge@@ aring of the second generation &quot; - he refers to himself even if he was born in Jordan . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own circumstances so &apos; st@@ resses H@@ da@@ ib .
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I &apos;m a man , &quot; while he sho@@ cked into water , Nes@@ et@@ an . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to go down from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of nutrition is illegal during Ram@@ ad@@ an .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ ib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand there has a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ing hot jun@@ k day little with protest against Islam . &quot;
basically the sl@@ ugs are loud coffee and the s@@ quad@@ ron of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette into the nose in the first line of freedom .
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when taking a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; so , it is easy to avoid fundamental things - as in the public during the Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to land not in jail . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a show of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila to the second time . &quot;
&quot; some members of Parliament that support the Islamic branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood , Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , opposed the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert table was . &quot;
the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the choir .
&quot; in addition , many claim that the dedication of the band in matters such as the Arab spring , human rights and free expression of expression in the Arab world may be dangerous acti@@ vism , which represents the established legitim@@ acy author@@ itarian regime in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;s L@@ eila inv@@ ests the Jord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continues to have opted for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is probably not simply a rh@@ et@@ oric of rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually reflect a clear cryst@@ alline reality in Jordan , which is clearly reflected in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib came to body traditional gender equality by taking his vision of the fate of Arab women to have vo@@ i@@ ch@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently broken unknown woman , whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who should actually trust . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of Hon@@ or &apos;s Hon@@ or - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; human Rights Watch stated that the number of Hon@@ our of Hon@@ our in 2016 reached its zen@@ ith ; however , the institutional infrastructure is still missing to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence to support the appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a law for frag@@ ile control from 1954 , women who are subjected to the risk of inner family violence can be imprisoned , and for their release is often a year @-@ long bureaucr@@ atic effort and the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for it , to rever@@ ence the issues that are long as tab@@ u in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib den@@ ies that his work is political , however , is a dream that he can separate his music that is full of explic@@ it att@@ achments on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; he was in@@ timi@@ dated to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ ib takes the question about the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; focus on poverty .
&quot; the list of songs that are politically , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ ib released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and each other is it . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the song H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a sort of market in which one can find in His words , &quot; that can be what one wants , &quot; whether it is faith or not believe , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he not@@ ices that there is hardly any one in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bian and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still very cen@@ sored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib initiated an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ Programme Ro@@ ya , to remember that his comments were torn from the context , twi@@ sted and cen@@ sored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but he was only a working version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ ib is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance of homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he menti@@ ons Abu Nu@@ a , a poet from the eighth century , who still has remained in memory today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib was wonder@@ ing : if Abu Nu@@ vo , who was later to work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , could write in the eighth century openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians do it ? &quot;
&quot; the actual problem so H@@ da@@ ib , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;s L@@ eila , or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ic kingdom , it is nothing new that the government attacks against free expression of expression and that progressive votes to silence . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service took several former government officials and members of the teacher &apos;s association , with the reas@@ oning , they had expressed themselves on comments in social media critical to the problems that were deeply ro@@ oted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of what is the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs concert , only the top of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to effect a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is an independent entity . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;s L@@ eila for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it looks too slow , thinking and intern@@ ally changes . it is certain that these changes took place in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; finally , H@@ da@@ ib lived here as millions of other Arabs , from a Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience &quot; them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is inspired by music , art and literature of a real and fundamental op@@ enn@@ ess - and not through bombs , spreading un@@ itions and on artificial fashion . at least he hopes . &quot;
&quot; until now , H@@ da@@ ib will continue to ri@@ p and dem@@ ise resistance . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these great , extravag@@ ant war d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one assumes that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in many neighbor@@ hoods in August . another theory states that the wag@@ ons , the drums and dancing more than a thousand years , came from the West Japan in the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi in force . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab a couple of great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
&quot; one can imagine just difficult , how big these parts are ... &quot;
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ al ) . &quot;
I have been looking at the meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : the two festival cars are just too visible .
&quot; nevertheless , there is for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only True - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ meter high dur@@ o was unbelievable .
let us enjoy the rest of summer !

&quot; rarely , external vision and body care were so important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and promote a legitim@@ ate profession like the hair of hair . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us main port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate where street noise and illegal drug dealers are daily . &quot;
a survey in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the outer borders of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
experts join each other to show who can create the ec@@ cent@@ rist@@ les L@@ ooks like you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitions there is on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Call@@ ao here , found an opportunity to find young people to obtain their weapons against hair@@ dresser and instead of bad Rat@@ chet to get an apprentices@@ hip in the hair@@ dresser , which enables them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and offering dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .

the following article is the revised version of the post @-@ bike message &quot; love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
this post is published here in the context of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write permission to people who we know ?
&quot; is it not so much more important to meet people who have stum@@ bled , aff@@ ection ? &quot;
this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to write the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) who encour@@ ages young people to supp@@ le gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
&quot; recently , her country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement of F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which constitutes the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
international was considered to be a sign of the peace agreement as such significant that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
&quot; there is still a long way ahead of Colom@@ bian , until one can speak of real reconciliation and reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who lived for many years in illegal camps , have been exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ oric and carried out their weapons in their lives , and have to re@@ integrate themselves into the life of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian company again , who had acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred versus gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now record their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian would have to close together with the integration process .
and exactly what did they do : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them again in the company .
&quot; the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , which should be handed over to personally . &quot;
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letter on reconciliation was formed at the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people we love to write on Valentine &apos;s Day , thousands of love , but those who need to need much more unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; he plane , he continued to share his love with people in this year , who needed the urgent feedback . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was created , letters full of hope and assistance to former fighters of the F@@ ARC , which now find their place in society and to create a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters are showing that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a history of peace to a common history of peace . &quot; &quot;
so far more than 2000 letters were collected in the context of the campaign .
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC presented themselves as they did earlier , to oppos@@ e the commands of their leaders . &quot;
but this time they received no commands but letters of people from all over the country .
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all those involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different emotions you can run through just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between , &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ nez Av@@ ila later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Governor of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience as follows : &quot;
&quot; after we had passed the letters , a former fighter caused me to be the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of tent in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go , because beside him on the bed a M@@ GL pomegran@@ ates , a deadly weapon in the thorn . &quot;
&quot; and I asked him , saying , &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I reply to a letter which someone has written . &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; ever in my life someone has written something so nice , so I answer it . &quot; then , suddenly , tears came about the che@@ eks . &quot;
I h@@ ug@@ ged him whole and sat down beside the pomegran@@ ates .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for war , he was sorry for all the years of loyal companion to this struggle , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life than war . at the F@@ ARC , the only way to preserve it and his six brothers in front of star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive myself for my fault . &quot;
&quot; now , I know that there is a society outside there , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have lear@@ nt just how I must handle weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace is over , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the first time , students and some of the F@@ ARC came together on a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up and the F@@ ARC already lived in secret .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC explained the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years have experienced how we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country just . &quot;
&quot; the goal of this magn@@ itude is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who have never found Hom@@ r before , and to recognise that people who were often seen as a monster , and even hate living only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their lives and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the land lives , hurt me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me , that all men - even those who have killed and caused much harm to give us a smile and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have answered the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian has been shown that after de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation peace would rule peace .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment possibilities , there will always be people who are ready to lift up and to protest against their rights and that is completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; by the F@@ ARC , we now rely on peace , politics without arms . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all the Defen@@ ders of Peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology they listen - to rise over all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . among us who can defend the life as foundation of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ min@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; on our way , there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Caucas@@ ian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and stress . &quot;
&quot; with terr@@ ors , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months over the persecution gay men in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that as a women &apos;s talk about the LGB@@ T@@ Q church is not only about the night .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who has dealt with us some of their experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the republic . &quot;
&quot; LGB@@ T rights in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines in several months after reports were published , the delay , torture and killing que@@ er men in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta , she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities arrested the susp@@ icious que@@ er and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; you brought a monster to the World &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
&quot; she became aware that Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya was not a safe place for them , so she went to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after having experienced a group of Che@@ chens of gender equality , the hunt for Sabrina was opened . &quot;
&quot; from fear for her life , she attracted the last end to the USA . &quot;
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ fer@@ in at a human rights organization .
&quot; one day , I told me that someone needed my help . &quot;
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone thought of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . so he wi@@ ped them to his ch@@ et@@ ch@@ n@@ ya friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men more in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya , who can eliminate this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents started with the What@@ s@@ App . &quot;
&quot; on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was just doing there , I heard a couple of shops from the back seat of my car , I heard a man@@ hood : &quot; here is a gift for you of your uncle . &quot;
&quot; as I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you honor the family , you sh@@ orth@@ and ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I just know there was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and a@@ woke last end in the hospital .
apparently some women had heard everything and began to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two col@@ on in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in which nurse were you laid - in men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor stood up and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Caucas@@ ian name . &quot;
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grateful to him that he has been respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month at the hospital .
&quot; last February , I received threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , and wrote to me -- relatives , strangers , some totally unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ fall .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; the slow@@ ed , send me back to Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya to prove that everything was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they set absurd claims : some said me , I have to prove it , going up without through the streets ; others wanted me that I had not changed to the official TV in Gros@@ ny , that I had not changed my gender , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have bas@@ eline size C - what would I have to say on television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this print ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some older people said to my mother at the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not just your family , but the whole republic sh@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother got too much , and she lay a rope around his neck . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily , the neighbours came and saved them . &quot;
&quot; at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
&quot; I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with a dar@@ ken@@ ed window pushed and a number plate with a 95 . &quot;
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy . &quot;
my Human Rights Friends checking the Num@@ ber@@ n@@ signs - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I don &apos;t want to remember them all . they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something un@@ realistic . &quot;
I can &apos;t understand how it could be .
&quot; just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived . &quot;
&quot; without registration , I bought it without ID , without ID . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
came and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered with a fore@@ igner .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I asked to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe about , you &apos;re in safety , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; we know , in which hotel you st@@ eck@@ st . you even know your room number . &quot;
only to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still contact your family in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about sex equality , this is a tab@@ u@@ theme . &quot;
&quot; some traditional Caucas@@ ian elements , I still bear in myself . &quot;
&quot; so much I wish it , I cannot overcome this se@@ el@@ ic barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to do it . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give myself effort to look like the person to look out of her past , that is , my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed ? &quot;
Sabrina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed more information about the situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
I was talking to someone who took one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an had not been arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he concluded a new wave . &quot;
now they will concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; with this , my I , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end , demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; glory &quot; has experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are men still gay men in these secret pris@@ ons now ?
&quot; Sabrina : a friend of mine , there would be not many . &quot;
&quot; if , especially those who have no rich relatives , or those of their relatives dropped in order to set the Kad@@ y@@ rows court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there to present it later than terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim they had attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these men were not simply missing , but targeted in to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is that now only a guess or have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated in Ar@@ gun for a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard had grown .
there has been nothing new from them since .
they simply took them .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was involved , when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , they were not introduced as band@@ its , there have been no reports yet . we assume that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would you not have allowed to shave with these people ?
&quot; do you know whether these persecutions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who have heard a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already arrived in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I &apos;ve been wearing my hair always long .
in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Gros@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
&quot; from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to the civil society &quot; civil society , &quot; but ultimately cast us back into the st@@ one@@ age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were p@@ inn@@ ed ; I had coloured eyelashes , wore tube je@@ ans and short tops . &quot;
the safety of the Sch@@ aria never has a hair curved to me .
&quot; before the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is : &quot; car@@ rot not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
&quot; they often say , often to children , when they do so funny about sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they just shut up their eyes off you , because they believed , they were ill ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they never ins@@ ulting me , never ch@@ ased , and never struck . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this subject matter ?
Sabrina : for so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
&quot; when he was named Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking on mor@@ ality on TV . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us by se , but above the behavior of women . &quot;
nevertheless - you could feel the people in the city were beginning to change .
&quot; who laughed and laughed in advance , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , I left Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came home , I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly wor@@ sen . &quot;
OC Media : what work do you go now ?
Sabrina : I &apos;m working as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn too much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the USA are not much .
&quot; apart from that , I am still working as a activist . &quot;
I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I comment on them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , coll@@ ars , I lead them to the hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t leave a p@@ enny for it .
I discovered these people himself when I took refuge .
&quot; I am the Muslim , and want to help those who need help . &quot;
OC Media : do you wear an Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ der .
&quot; so , nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Che@@ chens , who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no pigs . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have what , the cab@@ ar@@ din@@ er have , which , the Russians also have , are they - but not in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s un@@ pleasant to hear something . &quot;
&quot; here , I meet so many men out of the Caucas@@ us . &quot;
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go to the mosque and fa@@ sten during Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live with men together .
&quot; you know , many think about transc@@ end@@ ity to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his family to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a dec@@ aying . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of feelings , to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body . &quot;
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry I am so personal , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am myself myself .
local groups war@@ n at an increase of self @-@ mor@@ ant within the pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
&quot; the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population . &quot;
&quot; since the last months , there has been a strong rise of suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th is the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterised by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ el@@ ight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under anxiety , depression , and ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that may arise un@@ loading to his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights groups that are working in Ah@@ wa@@ z to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; on YouTube video , video held the moments after he had lit himself . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought up into the valley of Ah@@ mad . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the inc@@ in@@ eration was so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died short time later .
&quot; it was not the only one committed suicide in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists war@@ n before that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ ada@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hung . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing in common : it was all family fathers , who felt themselves due to the persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and un@@ fit to feed their families with a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , which is based in the majority of the Arab people living in Iran , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to dispute its habitat . &quot;
&quot; in a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and gained great efforts in 1925 that ethnic autonomy come down throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran @-@ coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most influential and most valuable materials for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the native population gets only little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; they often have victims of untreated diseases , hunger and empt@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arab@@ ians has been ref@@ using systematically jobs in the local oil , gas , and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a variety of dam@@ men , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation of desol@@ ation , and destroy the local agriculture , as well as the local agriculture and palm @-@ trees industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate under the Arab A@@ Hawai@@ ian young@@ sters went up to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general manager for cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job to have completed the primary school , 55 % have completed a university degree . &quot;
a systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Minister of Human Rights in London , declared Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and rac@@ ist eth@@ nic@@ ity , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i males . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly the unemployment has become worse . for this reason , a combination of a high number of victims of Ah@@ wa@@ z are new to ethnic Per@@ sians and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot;
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions do not pre@@ fers Arabic workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to working opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic politics of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national Resistance Young Arabs and to force her living outside of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their predecess@@ ors and sur@@ names to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i to hide so , since even Arab names are not toler@@ ated , because the speaking of Arabic language or the wearing of Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances given that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to endure , human rights activists propose an alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it stays off if the world w@@ akes up and taking knowledge .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and committed suicide .

&quot; why I do not cooperate with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ section &quot;

the following article is an revised version of the opinion which was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . this article was the subject of several discussions in which many positions came up .
they can be read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women respond to many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even thought well @-@ thought scientific and social reas@@ oning from me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally ask all femin@@ ist * inside . &quot;
&quot; for example , women still earn less money in spite of equal education . &quot;
that women still stand under str@@ ingent observation when it comes to what they can do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards are still responsible for that women , sooner or later , in various areas of life to a gl@@ itter@@ ing blanket , and that discrimination based on the sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is aware and known .
I am convinced and I suffer double and thre@@ e@@ fold less .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : if I come to talk to skin color , rac@@ ism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the LGB@@ T community or on black women from the di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; if I suppose that we are always found under rac@@ ism and suffering from the femin@@ ist movement , both in and outside of femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists were silent . &quot;
&quot; however , they all agree that women - all women should come together to sing &quot; their voices , &quot; to sing &quot; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord &quot; to sing the equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about it , that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence is a motivated form of r@@ assi@@ stic violence , which we are black women to double @-@ point . &quot;
&quot; or about that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and games are less likely to earn less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as a white girl , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black sp@@ ouses and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk of domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on one hand , I wish that all men , all men and all men have any skin colour of the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join the same rights as black woman who ref@@ uses to consider un@@ just@@ ification in their thinking , which refers to gender and skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and won &apos;t fight for my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has always turned me , and countless other black women and always turned down again . &quot;
&quot; in 1851 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I no wife ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ g@@ inal essence . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join me groups who also absorb our customs and customs , in order to advance their eg@@ o@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to learn white women over the importance of over@@ cuts of skin colour and gender . for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was established to give women a home to women , and ren@@ ounce of white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to resolve me full and entirely of femin@@ ism and put me on the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , who was brought to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so stub@@ born that interfer@@ ing is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it &apos;s more important than ever , that we can define black women in our own performances and put us into the spher@@ es which can be created by us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana , ur@@ ism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves - and not only that - black women may also bear spaces in which they can make ourselves totally secure and even the spiritual elements that make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will call Separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion after having read these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a bl@@ ur@@ istic environment , I can lift up black women and women of other cultures , because I exist in this para@@ dig@@ m . &quot;
I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life did not survive , nor ignored , nor turned down . &quot;
p@@ addle against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this entry of To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine called for special about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of an content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; ever again , Nabil Mus@@ a traveled over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a special issue through the Iraqi Kurdistan region . its mission aims to make people conscious of clean waters for present and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in its community .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was still a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ mark Alliance , which aims to protect and protect the rivers , streams , streams , and water ways in Iraq as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the pressures and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have any water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was filmed and published for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq and multi @-@ media journalist , filmed and published . &quot;

Paraguay women and their difficult struggle against violence
a group of women are &quot; The crying women &quot; to express their pain about women &apos;s mor@@ ality in the country and in the region and show their re@@ jection .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of tur@@ ally . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # temporary female subjects ) who reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected people .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ partner who had become violent across violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship was a little time passed and the police said , her statement would be laid to the acts , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for fail@@ ing , the ac@@ claimed display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez did nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second wife moved her ad .
breaking the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women receive an ad at all , they don &apos;t receive support from the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to admit victim of violence at all in the prosecution authorities . &quot;
&quot; In@@ sert 1 stro@@ kes and Stati@@ ik@@ en@@ 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that has nothing to mal@@ imm@@ ed 3 Paraguay laws : good approach , lacking realisation and statistics &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to see how many women are really har@@ assed , My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues on Centro de Document@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ gy@@ ms , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different data and reports that do not even indicate the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; the numbers available , however , are al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Public Prosecutor of At@@ tor@@ ney met 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . 70 % of them went about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of ads came from women .
there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the peace of peace . 86 % of the ads came from women too .
&quot; in the advertisement , 40 % of women reported that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women talked of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women are not doing this . &quot;
&quot; for every woman ref@@ unded for physical abuse , there are two women who do not do this , &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; as women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , law en@@ forcement agencies cannot be documented , as many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; only until August 2016 , journalists in the country counted at least 12 cases of women in land . &quot;
&quot; the Coordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women have been murdered by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violent men . &quot;

invisible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mariana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera that she named him the names of all their former friends .
&quot; at the beginning , she did not want to do that , but then she should repent . &quot;
today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer have died with Carlos . but for two years she bore the psych@@ ic force on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe :
I would have never thought that I would have a victim of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
&quot; if I have read earlier about it , I thought that this only thing that happens to sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they are dis@@ illu@@ sion@@ ed by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , they wrote contributions on Facebook where they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two years relationship and told how he had isolated it . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ tic , whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mariana , why she had fallen so long by Carlos , and did not leave it earlier . &quot;
it was almost like they wanted to say that victim of ab@@ uses at least had some complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria Santos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was har@@ assed . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o @-@ CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way of ab@@ uses .
&quot; in the group , they can talk with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the testimony of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything began with mental abuse .
her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads by the authorities , without a result and from their relatives , they received no support . &quot;
&quot; it led a process against its former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal fight between Paraguay and their home country , where it mainly went about money , power and the influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paraguay laws : good approach to lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of ab@@ uses is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems with the use of laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ E@@ lla ( # FÃ¼r@@ st ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ x@@ men@@ os ( # Non@@ Just L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by am@@ nesty International .
the original bill of the law sees to explain the Fem@@ ale to an independent off@@ ence and har@@ dens to pun@@ ish as it is in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus , the legislative text has changed in some points to also win the MPs for the law that feared the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions , which are generally prohibited in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had planned to pay the majority of ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) process costs which must present the victims of violence at present , if they just want to im@@ itate an indication and receive a safe accommodation to state the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law does not be effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial resources available for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ism is seen as a part between human relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , that violence is no longer considered a little standard . &quot;
&quot; who , in view of these facts , join in , and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators will come near . &quot;
we need to refund so long for fail@@ ing to no longer than normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the Act was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously parts of the law had changed . in this case a passage was canc@@ eled , who called the partners in cases of domestic violence on reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
&quot; the Section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ gres@@ sor , attack his sacrifice again . &quot;
&quot; however , the cancellation of the words &quot; sex , &quot; &quot; political violence , and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after ban a newspaper continue to ass@@ aul@@ ts attacks
&quot; this website was locked out due to a decision of the information Minister , &quot; is listed on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the om@@ anic authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to their coverage of corruption in the s@@ ult@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the newspaper &apos;s editors , is still in prison where he served one year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Za@@ her Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and placed before the court , but later returned to trial . &quot;
&quot; Oman is governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said , who came to power since 1970 , after he had lost his father , Sa@@ Ã¯@@ i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a coup d &quot;
&quot; since then he has been clothed , next to his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces , Minister of Defence , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the Sultan is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular the domestic intelligence service , the public liberties , including freedom of public freedom , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists , to be in@@ timi@@ dated and incar@@ cer@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the authorities have a peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in human rights , systematic and hin@@ dering citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions in both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , her closure and detention of three of her editors during the last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported in Oman in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) since its foundation in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article entitled &quot; &quot; High @-@ Level Parties to Justice &quot; &quot; in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , following corruption in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report government officials accused the accused of raising the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure , to raise a judgment in an inheritance . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , dated July 26 , 2016 , with a report on the title page with the inscription : &quot; high level parties bind hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Za@@ her Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the editorial department of the Executive Committee , was invited by the ISS and was arrested by the Security Council on his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS announced the vice @-@ editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who was chief editor @-@ in after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed on un@@ definite period after the information minister had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on every way , including online , will be banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , before the Court of Mas@@ cat , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place before the Court . &quot;
&quot; the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison terms , and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted and convicted of disturb@@ ance of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the internet &quot; and &quot; sub@@ ter@@ ation of the state &quot; . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violations of an audience &apos;s prohibition and sl@@ ander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to three years of prison terms and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . it was also a professional prohibition against both journalists .
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after being able to represent the use of an information network on material that could be a threat to the public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a security deposit was set at the amount of 5000 om@@ ani Ri@@ al ( 13,000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the Jud@@ gment . &quot;
&quot; in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , the Court of Appeal said Al @-@ Ha@@ j , however , sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was sentenced on 10 April 2017 after a re@@ plen@@ ishment of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his imprisonment sentence .
the Appeals Court also cons@@ ul@@ ted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in spite of the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper sees itself as a result of attacks by the om@@ anic government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Information Minister received an assignment with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information was personally signed an additional instruction in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the minister introduced another time against the decision of the Appeals Court to allow the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the continuous closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman was injured in Oman at the youngest time .
&quot; other injuries include the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ in and exercising print on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set up their operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuous closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Afghan authorities are still not willing to prepare an extensive breach of press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the public authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately release and un@@ condition@@ ally released ;
2 . to create a safe environment for Az@@ am@@ n &apos;s newspaper that they may follow their journalists from their work ;
&quot; 3 . protect the press freedom in the country , &quot;
&quot; 4 . under any circumstances , to ensure that human rights def@@ ending and journalists in Oman can hin@@ dered their legally binding human rights and without fear of prevention , including judicial ver@@ ch@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation , human rights def@@ ending ( including independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf area and the right to gather peace@@ fully , supported and supported them protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture is done with its understanding &quot;
medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research , there are two reasons to be missing in the offer of the global healthcare industry , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have a great problem in the poorest countries of Africa far as elsewhere , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases caused by pharmaceutical companies . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research that is carried out by African scientists themselves , in building its own research capacity in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious imp@@ lications for national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana . &quot;
&quot; as post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he studied at the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and over mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media over these research . &quot;
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as private owner ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; I also launch a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens . &quot;
g@@ v : what are your opinion about important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain recipi@@ ents , rather than to be M@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; solutions that we get are often used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here . &quot;
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported different .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t had before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have continuous supplies with electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it lasts months to import from other countries . &quot;
g@@ v : how is the public opinion of science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; g@@ v : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it be concentrated , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there are demand for special scientific training , starting in each age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of the space of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often there are limited speed , things to do , and the limit access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the US to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this contribution of Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on breed in the United States since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant grown by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in the space and has been consumed . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ ons had worked only by his own income and the question of how many salads he can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more and more sal@@ aries were patented , and that he could not continue to use it for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only for individual varieties but also for certain characteristics , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or mixed sheets . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years more of such patents have been registered for more plants , such as cereals or cart@@ ons . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environmental protection and experts provide food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of one mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on is still a salad , but it is now longer necessary because his work is still worth further . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if in a river a b@@ oul@@ ders are lying around which I must sw@@ add@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a split with the breeding &quot; tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go to salads too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed any more sal@@ aries , because all characteristics are already patented &quot; . &quot; he makes so good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and endeav@@ our@@ able to use no material being protected as intellectual property . &quot;
it has also been connected to a movement connected to the United States and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have been cultivated and eaten red RÃ¶@@ mer@@ sal@@ at the variety Out@@ red@@ dish in the greenhouse gas station and eaten . there will be tested if plants can be cultivated in space .

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like this , as would stem from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding . &quot;
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software to provide alternatives to copyright protected software .
&quot; it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property , and are usable for plant bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eders can also under@@ take that others can use the far@@ med seed @-@ free . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they can &apos;t continue to make business with their seed and we can sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others who buy seeds to breed it , and it will not immediately come out - two aspects that are forbidden by many plant pat@@ ents . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seeds have already joined the initiative in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the emer@@ ald professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg must control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seeds plays a role in large merger such as Bio@@ diversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would attempt to use the latter not or just a little to use , by re@@ juven@@ ating seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture , or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , &quot; as for example , we need control over seeds in the global agricultural industry , as well as for example on farms may also know how this vegetable is bred to be threatened . &quot;
&quot; nutrition , without seed , is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative under@@ took to provide other crops freely available , with that , in contrast , its progress can be patented in contrast to its seed and plant features . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argu@@ ed that the future of food supplies will be at risk , as the available indoor pool due to the increasingly large @-@ looking intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always reduced . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , a Director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability . it found that approximately one @-@ third of all @-@ party features are protected as intellectual property , making it either not even usable in plants . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , there are not such estimates yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass@@ aging plants like wheat in larger style are patented as salad or carrots . &quot;
a Question of View
plants are so far@@ med that they have targeted entities - from such as their taste or its color improves until such as they thri@@ ve in certain environments such as p@@ ests or diseases .
&quot; patents of Pat@@ ents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is steadily increasing by more patents . however , genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changing conditions are predic@@ table by climate change much worse . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spre@@ cher Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognize that genetic diversity is generally important and crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and the United States , use the company for the conservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it says that intellectual property promote other bre@@ eders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties &quot; promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is essentially taken as soon as the patent has expired . &quot;
often these statements help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; so , such protection will not prevent innovations , but it promotes the public more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on looks like this : for 20 years , until a patent of patent , certainly no innovations will be convey@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for such a long time to grow on plants , which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; the main argument of Mort@@ on is that genetic resources always have been a general well and it should remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want to help farmers work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible to us if we are not able to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept to patented plant features : &quot; we do not create the characteristics . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them , and as bre@@ eders we don &apos;t have any idea how plants do this . &quot;
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; whoever cat@@ ches a variety , also put his own values into them . &quot;
&quot; anyone who believes in industrial agriculture , with big farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , are needed to cultiv@@ ate her@@ b@@ icides , breeding into his varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is precise . &quot;
&quot; some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than for Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they can survive most smaller seed companies - either do they reject and do it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile , or both is the case . &quot;
the independent pl@@ antation Frank Mort@@ on takes place in his breeding garden Sal@@ ad in his breeding garden .

&quot; Mort@@ on is also the opinion that bre@@ eders caused by avo@@ idance of plant pat@@ rons , &quot; It looks like I think with my efforts to produce new things , stronger than companies that are pat@@ enting . &quot;
&quot; I need a new material for my catalog , as I know my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years prior to the competition , with which in my opinion it is quite easy . &quot;
&quot; although the United States seem to be leading the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is an &quot; open source &quot; seed range . to ensure the seed of traditional crops , the centre with farmers worked together to breed new varieties . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed and sell its own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i commitment to bre@@ eder in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for breeding differ from land to land , absent because of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation , not one can be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventional far@@ med plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus she speaks against the present practice of the European Patent Office , which patents are based on conventional far@@ med plants . &quot;
&quot; however , a statement is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to adopt the Patent Office to implement these new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation H@@ iv@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators and representatives from governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and representatives from all East Africa to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and global trend towards the sponsor@@ ing of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos;s program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems that the organization is currently offering a worldwide alliance to &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for the scheduled next year of the official starting signal . &quot;
&quot; a combination of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group for Ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on Ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity around the world to publish a seed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a consortium of aux@@ iliary agencies such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - published a report . in this , it represents the opinion that farmers have the opportunity to share it and improve the seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food . &quot;
&quot; the report will also emphas@@ ize the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that soon more people will recognize him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods is especially respected , where and how something is grown , and seeds systems have hardly played any role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to make people clear that even more behind their food . &quot;

human Rights Organisation and Blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still lock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend of the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents the human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook where it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharply critic@@ ised and promised to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information &quot; - despite this attack and the failure of the Egyptian Law and the Constitution by the authorities , who were to defend the law , were never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I , however , was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I , however , was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I said that all technical possibilities were to overcome , to overcome the barriers and not have to admit , our task will continue to fulfill . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I , as the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 websites , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ German edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jazeera network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights research Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada . &quot;
zi@@ ada took his blog to the distribution of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles which he writes non@@ accessible websites and media in Egypt .
&quot; now the blog , which he established to b@@ ypass the batt@@ lements of the Egyptian government , is the aim of an attack itself . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , who is native to Canada &apos;s blog , is also available on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 and conducted a video as the police executed physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly turning around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada was commented on the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; but it is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be important for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been able to con@@ vey to me the feeling of a siege of siege ; An arrest , an attempted murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website , which I worked . &quot;
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words : my words have influence if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent the c@@ ens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have closed it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mud take the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 pages . there are technical tests for the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , among others Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers that was possible via internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday 12 June , we realized how the blocking of Web sites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
&quot; such practice indicates the intention of the government to block and filter , to filter and filter to the Egyptian users . &quot;
&quot; the situation will also be scre@@ wed in addition to the fact that the decisions are made behind the closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no rule , so that the Egyptian population can act against this actions . &quot;
&quot; now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship , and who will attack them next ? &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

&quot; day for day reports newspapers in Brazil with a dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous post@@ card designs . &quot;
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old is shot in school , &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer will be murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Wash@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and the financial situation , violence reached the highest level in Rio in 2017 at the highest level of 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports how these are all everyday and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio well known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; &quot; in which they announced , a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ ves for her decision declared the paper :
&quot; it will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city on the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexu@@ al@@ ab@@ outs , etc . everything that happens by the civili@@ zed standard and what only happened in Rio will be called the &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we don &apos;t close our eyes from the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor of the newspaper announced that this decision was no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
&quot; extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world , with a war of war in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war . &quot;
&quot; in the same video , a journalist wrote the newspaper that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 territories , which controls criminal organisations . &quot;
in the Editorial the newspaper writes further :
&quot; we are aware that a war dis@@ course when it is dist@@ orted , even if it can be dist@@ orted , the atro@@ cities of the police that sho@@ ots and then ask questions to disgu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war , based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and their partner . &quot;
does the designation &quot; war &quot; hurt more than it ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bras@@ il , the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ ed to signi@@ fy the violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion for a just@@ ification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to enter the police force . &quot;
this is no war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and worse planning , as extra in the analysis of the military @-@ interest rates in Rio itself has shown - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in staff , education and a historical and self @-@ counter@@ feit negle@@ ct in public service . &quot;
&quot; reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital , too . &quot;

&quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro will be one of the most violent cities in Brazil according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most current available data . &quot;
no such cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we have a look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates in the state , Rio is at number 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; it has been specially owned by the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company South America , such as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has been repeated for years the security policy of the State . &quot;
&quot; the formation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the police unit presented by the state of Rio in 2003 , is aimed at cap@@ turing a massive police raid a fav@@ ela and become a unit permanently there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of for@@ cible deaths . since a couple of years , the U@@ PP was to protect the poor communities against the poor communities who should actually protect the curious police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited from one of its articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not indicate the - by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio considered war is also serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; because this calls for the state to use means and ways that are typical for a war . in addition , the entry into the territory of a &quot; fine &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ ally damage &quot; and &quot; dist@@ ort bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war or her , fact , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ ela remains in Rio . &quot;
&quot; one week it is now that the police have er@@ adic@@ ated the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer most brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Worldwatch , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and surrounding , Homs , D@@ eir ez and Id@@ li@@ b present about one million Syrians in a state of siege . &quot;
&quot; the Eastern G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 is especially affected by hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are decl@@ ining , based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was committed by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels controlled territories outside of Damascus have stood under siege under siege , which led to a population of local or through tun@@ nels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the lon@@ gl@@ asting block@@ ade , traditional food products have become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as counter@@ act , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics have taught the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ en@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms are not included in the conventional , in Syria , and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes it extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . her food quality is becoming an attractive food source for many residents of the besie@@ ged east G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the conclusion of the project , subscription , said to the French news agency AFP : &quot;
&quot; we opted for cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that this project had been fighting for three years and pushed aside his relief that it now gains more and more . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , you use the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ en@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to mediate 125 family knowledge to plant fung@@ i , so Dr. L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations on Can@@ Do through Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the fuel short@@ age , locally sour@@ ced fuel from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary power . &quot;
&quot; Dr. L@@ eila said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began to start production from the regions in the regions , before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; afterwards they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as this , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have created a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the start of the project and after further 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in G@@ hou@@ ta , free of charge . &quot;
L@@ eila explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ us of different reasons . &quot; &quot; fraction of siege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; dis@@ sem@@ ination of a culture of self catering ( such as paper , tea , coffee rate , cardboard , etc ) will be used to use new food . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are bound to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege is visible . &quot;
we want our experience to help people in crisis areas and we can help mankind .

Portuguese Call for Justice for the Vic@@ tims of 2017
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21 in many districts of capit@@ als in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were gra@@ fted in the north of Portugal in the week . &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two people died and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October , which led to the government last week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of state . &quot;
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire bur@@ sts , spread across the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where the fires erup@@ ted 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forestry surveillance system , which monitors the forest area by satellite photos alone , are burned to approximately 500,000 acres of forest in Portugal alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so you can make a better picture of serious the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; entirely Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017 &quot;
some of the pictures of Twitter shared pictures :

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into the event :
the un@@ mistak@@ able tragedy
the target of Saturday &apos;s protest was the demand for better relief and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to im@@ pose the degree of tragedy as far as possible
&quot; JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al explained by the federal government of Portugal , the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o said : &quot;
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages have been evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
they did so wrong : there are dozens of pictures of open streets surrounded by fire .
Lei@@ ria &apos;s forest would have been able to pass a similar tragedy in June since the streets were very late .
&quot; in addition , construction permits in ec@@ r@@ t@@ alism will be paid at a high speed of Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko . &quot;
&quot; a far reaching proposal on the Wal@@ dre@@ form , which had brought the government following serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was established by the municipalities that saw the new rules as obst@@ acle for investments . &quot;
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity of case , if the applicant could be over and had an open back@@ door , so that it was built by JoÃ£o Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of slightly com@@ bu@@ stible wood , as in a v@@ icious circle , continues to spread to fires of this species . &quot;
&quot; in addition to these issues , the website of the civil protection of Portugal was visited by Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when residents were seeking or tried to contact relatives . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civilian data using the f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real @-@ time above the site and the spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer of JoÃ£o P@@ ina to simpli@@ fy the work of fire brig@@ ade and was thus crucial for the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400,000 users that followed the fires that followed , not stand@@ still : this site counted more than half a million . &quot;

&quot; in one night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began with the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din @-@ group@@ ings who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan became a land of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner together . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say so at that time , she knew her son would no longer see her son - maybe even more . &quot;
in the morning of dawn the boy was to break .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the p@@ res .

&quot; Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , was just murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt uns@@ afe . &quot;
the Taliban were always getting closer to their hatred in the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape A@@ shar@@ af took place in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ hes@@ itation . work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his small wages , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and to@@ wed sacks with mort@@ ar that were heavier than he himself , in order to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , life Afghan refugees had been influenced by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , which we also worked . &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows that we don &apos;t freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without Pap@@ ers in Iran , and ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small and un@@ inhabited island island .
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af arrived in Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af left homeless , ran through the streets of Rome alone , slept in parks , and went to a church , who distributed twice a day of food to needy . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is due to relatively high @-@ will@@ ingly quot@@ as a kind of second chance for exemp@@ li@@ fied asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true , however , that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are des@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the large majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special recording centres . &quot; this is an impro@@ mpt@@ u facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception center if they are officially requested an application for asylum - which can be taken for months after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; by then there are people who have no money to stay , either to the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his in@@ comparable lifestyle helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; having made various work in construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af tasted his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is Suc@@ cess Story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Behin@@ d Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind the Venetian &quot; - an Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded 24 times in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , around 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
for many of them the country is a trans@@ itional solution on the way to other European countries .
&quot; in recent years , there were some Afghanistan @-@ operated companies including tail@@ or , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian media for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Oriental experience in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells of the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy . &quot;
&quot; the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna , and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome , also in Afgh@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals are far enough , however , far beyond the Italian Wine business and the retail trade , and target back to the country that he had forced to leave in@@ mates as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I never forget my country , and I can &apos;t live happ@@ ily if I know that my people suffers . &quot;
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as all others .
&quot; he also decor@@ ates plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can get packing and preservatives technologies . &quot; thus , they can sell their harvest@@ ers on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubts , but at the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
he has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afghanistan in this way .
&quot; Ne@@ ti@@ zen report : legal accus@@ ations from Egypt to enable social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan for more than 900 days in detention . &quot;
&quot; he reported about the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a bill , which indicates that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration by a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users would have to use to use social networks within six months following the most successful legislative decision on the authority of the authority , including their complete name as well as their identification number . &quot;
&quot; those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months , or the En@@ voy of a criminal payment . &quot;
the law which was applied by sixty members of Parliament is currently deb@@ ated to the legislative and the constitutional committee of Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; another MP was a legislative proposal , in which harder pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the president or a high civil servants would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian judgment , the president of the President as well as state institutions have already been pun@@ ish@@ able . under the law proposition a kind of such act would be imposed with prison and fin@@ es , right @-@ handed in the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be adopted , this can be sentenced to three years in prison for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would hold a political climate in which the right to free expression of expression and assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud subscription Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , when he demonstr@@ ating Egyptian police officers , demonstr@@ ating violence against protest@@ ers who advoc@@ ated against the military coup of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest@@ ers who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in prison on a court case . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was moved to the 20th May , because the prison term , according to the human rights groups , failed to bring the accused of prison in the court room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups involved , apparent burden from among other weapons of weapons , illegal Assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seats on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties by journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the preceding incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
tun@@ es@@ ian activists to le@@ aked documents
&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia is mainly li@@ stens to a le@@ aked action plan . according to the plan explicitly stated a controversial law by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption .
&quot; the document published on April 21 , based on the document at Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , throws a light on how the prepar@@ atory plans to support the legislative state . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia dis@@ closure the nam@@ ing of its sources under the statement of Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press department which rep@@ els the right to protection of their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case . &quot;
is China willing to force social media users to present their identity ?
&quot; according to new rules of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China before writing or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the registration is stated that registration will be required with the full re@@ els name . &quot;
&quot; analysts assume that through the elimination of anonymous comments in Entertainment within social networks , it is un@@ clear until now the authorities will apply this regulations . &quot;
Chinese Organ@@ iz@@ ers proposed in the social media that controls only sel@@ ective to en@@ force the civil journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we then see in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the State c@@ ens@@ orship for Russia closed down access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to the Ros@@ e@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ chat is committed to register as the &quot; organizer of the information spread &quot; in the state government . &quot;
&quot; this term is part of an Act of 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government will provide a list of online services that will be responsible for the publication of the information , and to make it a further information to the removal of contents and to force them on request for dis@@ closure of user data . &quot;
&quot; websites are currently such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ c@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most common social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has spar@@ ks Wikipe@@ di@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court disp@@ osed the blocking of Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to er@@ ase two English articles , the information that Turkey support the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication were blocked because they were &quot; an information source that joined together with groups to join a political diff@@ user campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey blocks the website completely . it is thus , among others , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
great Britain cannot stop her@@ ring
&quot; after this week , the Great Britain &apos;s government is located in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications within real@@ time , to monitor data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government cons@@ ul@@ ted tel@@ co companies and intelligence agencies on the proposal , however , has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be re@@ directed to the Interior Ministry . &quot;
