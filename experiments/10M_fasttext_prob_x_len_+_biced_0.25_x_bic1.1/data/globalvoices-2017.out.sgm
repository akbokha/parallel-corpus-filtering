<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA for at least once a year I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I also grew up with American movies, have been dancing to American music, American authors and powered his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a profound impact on me that I was mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless journalist who had faced with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura-student of the murderous conspiracy of an oil Magna as the Supreme Court with the judges who wanted his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was it as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I said," "America is the only country in which I ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people."</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very warmer love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the ophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me how he goes with his narrow-minded.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as you are saying so nicely.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he tells what he thinks of a former colleague, and explains his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his testimonies and agreed in droves for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he won with the Republican Presidential elections, was the highest number formed by the nominated candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support these bigs person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not be able to meet Trump and his voters I had met with people in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"like for example my Professor Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, people from all over the world, a deeply believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps, also voted among Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity, which I experienced for Sandy Bahr, who fights for their lives to the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with patience and gentleness and helped my colleagues to accustom us to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then Andrew Lectures, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me have helped me much in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those embodied by they embodied my love in America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump gave his way to the nominate Republican Presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart of its limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the idea of the idea that people voted for trump, because they either divided his racism and fanatism, or because they were willing to oversee these things, broke my heart almost."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call Trump-voters as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange people, one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficially and respectful, and implies an inability to understand those who act on another way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears were not taken into account through the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that this voters, of which most of them are, for trump, because they want to regain control over a country that she disappoints?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who comments the cruel decision to rise a man who looks down with contempt upon those who look different."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(Anm. WC.: as much as the rejection of white against all other ethnicities"; word game from white into backlash into the white and whiplash, as the big Van Jones called, exactly what America did so great. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world estimate the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have, America is always welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenianers, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"but with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America's promises and says: to hell with versatility, religious freedom and the whole term of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in the Americas, after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the ruin, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all that I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd. "</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have been my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" "Mr Khan."</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"if Muslims had a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roared the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices were louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone who is not as you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"he received a unanimous and silent" NO "!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan closed with the words:" "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"that is now Trumps Land," said the message. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could no place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguadish town Cateura in common?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music that is played at both places, not only the life of children has changed, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the apostasy</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby magnificent Tuscan Ruins and its famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years, La Banda de Música (Musikbande) is now playing in the municipality: one of the children and adults of existing symphony orchestra, which has found their musical instruments an opportunity to overcome the surrounding poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and gangs violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously. the local press noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">"once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you always come and play with shining eyes and play in the turf you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically on the largest landfill of Asuncion in Paraguay's capital - on instruments which are produced from reprocessed waste materials:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with prepared instruments made up of local firm waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where recycling works under the direction of Favio Chávez had begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imitate violin, viola, celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trumpets, trumpets, trumpets, trumpets, trumpets and trumpets were produced."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musical teacher of the children of Cateura, remembers the starting time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where the children had known no music and it was very difficult to contact parents, because many of them do not live with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">"that changed when Favio was somewhat shown, which he had never seen before: a native violin."</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a complete orchestra which plays on instruments prepared on instruments and called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (harmonic landfill) awards the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of waste every year.</seg>

<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already been operated in Liberia's waters of illegal fishing before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were gradually cancelled and inclined, a lawsuit of this species to their coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised quickly against the ship. they refused to share one of their harbors and refused to share him a fishing permits."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly, the Premier was surrounded by countries that are simply refused," "Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and persecuted."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was forced to pay $2 million on Liberia for pillaging of fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects against criminal practices and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing) in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are among Somalia and Madagascar, six countries, who then driven out the Premier from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are equal and working together. you can exchange information and stand each other for illegal fishing," says Tony Long, head of Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is captured, is hidden because of it is extremely difficult to track. thus, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate mising existing laws, with which certain habitats and species are supposed to be protected, illegal fishing ecosystems, which have an delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"however, while actions against illegal fishing once were hampered by bureaucratic obstacles and also through the snowy empo, with information between individual countries, the actions nowadays occur in real-time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists existing licenses, news to suspicious activities or details, which one can notice or experienced during a harbour inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, if they move on the open sea, by satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in banned areas - such as suspicious driving routes - such as those that indicate a ship of caught fish on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the idealcase, such investigations can show whether the ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing connections, on the basis of this information we may deny the adoption of such ships in their ports. what means that ships can not be forced to sell their load, as in case of Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it will then take significant financial losses for the owner, which means illegal fishing is financially no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that's what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Executive Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a Beraterman that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">Closed Front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD of lost sales in order to lose the eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of Illegal Fischer, which penetrate eastern African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies located in the world of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these even those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"among other practices, such actions count as sailing under false flag, fake licensing securities, specializing in identifienamen, fishing-protected species and fish in nature areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they are targeted specifically to use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-mosquito-organized control system," "says Long." "previously, a ship could fishing illegally and a country could say 'You must not start my port'."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and this legitimate conclusion seems to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">"so far, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its foundation, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspected ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">"criminal networks are being exposed to counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities used, and it has found winged ships and found it."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency to fight crimes, FISH-i may share information on illegal fishing over large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far to the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i to provide suspicious ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed further, helps to find illegal ships to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the Illegal Fischer use very refined techniques to conceal their activities and their location. "" says Duncan Copeland, Head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be used by satellite."</seg>
<seg id="135">"for this reason, Copeland helps to build a system which links different informations? it should help FISH-i to find criminating ships with larger precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of african nations actually take effect on the unquestionably global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos: President of the NRO SkyTruth believes.</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the ocean protection organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of every traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of it, who knows what is doing - that makes sense", "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and join her resources for the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run, with which a global system permits the tracking of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities cannot only feel criminal but they are relocusts.</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that previously fished without a license sooner and hardly any consequences, we know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the FISH-i participating countries have meanwhile increased a 33% increase in fisheries, since fishing boats increased more licenses since then."</seg>
<seg id="145">"when FISH-i Somalia helped Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board slipping, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa will disappear several hundred million dollars annually by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there are six countries close to the so-called West Africa Task Force, too. they are now fighting illegal fishing, after exactly the same model as FISH-i." "security is the aim of letting go even more of such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently FISH-i's youngest member land Somalia's first major triumph report: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag, and not only the ship was used without a license and have been banned by tow networks that are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also enclosed in forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the take of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "said Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time, the evidence that such a special, collaborative working methods to protect the oceans really works in the entire world of sea.

<seg id="351">"the mistake had fallen to the interpreter Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also who made the local loids carefully."</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun's publicly released daily newspaper wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that nobody has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult for older people and an international city as Kyoto's just unacceptable," "said Holmes."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the flawed English translation was initially removed. the term" "Drivers" "(German:" awesome car driver ") was later replaced by the appropriate, even grammatically not entirely correct name" Elder Drivers "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the Kyoto's police prefade apologized for the translation errors. furthermore, they declared that the error had already been included in the text, which they had been tested by translators and that the translation was not tested on their correctness before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are very sorry that older people felt by the insufficient correction (translation) us," said the police. "</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News sat down with the phenomenon of the "awesome" older driver in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" terrible "was denouncing as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved, but quite a reason to worry."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, in 2005 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors. this represents a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors finished 1.803 from a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">"thus, their share rose to 17.7%."</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has sunk in total, the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period increased."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for transferring, you need two major skills: passive language skills to understand the output and transfer language skills to transfer him into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in case of native language. in general the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">"thus, a French native speaker, for example, should translate into French into English, not by French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a mother tongue, which could make translations into English. this may be due to understanding, cost, or the relatively small number of English speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that do not have foreign employees themselves, have yet to be made public. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is better than the best, become a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely distributed - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the rendable and enigmatic phrases that arise by machine translations, show that this technology can not replace yet a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulation in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints that are often used in t-shirts or bags, are not used for stystic reasons - not to be read or understood at all."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr-User Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be unacceptable or at least harmless. however, by large companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can see more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">The Kyoto city will hope to use a serious source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. the prefecture of Miyagi prefecture was in Japan's Northeast prefecture with both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced evacuated because the tsunami made whole coastline to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"the Fukushima prefecture still experienced a nuclear accident that alone, about 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows the local perspective of which progress has been reached six years later in order to rebuild the life of local rules.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding agency as well as survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the construction situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that, up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (which are only completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to list the largest success among the three prefectures, and 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such homes, whereas Fukushima is the final light with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"although still, six years after the disaster, evacuated by accommodation services (which will be evacuated by Behel fsu) in definitive spare parts."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the three-fold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people had to live in dwelling accommodations."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima, and Iwate lived in such circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="557">"in 2011, nearly 40 percent of the Fukushima evacuated evacuated in 2011 was still more successful in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful in the evacuation of over 75 percent of the evacuation of the evacuation in final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the figure is at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of works and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by misfortune, their gates will be opened up until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial reconstruction of the three prefectures are far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 percent of fishing airports in Iwate and Miyagi are back in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have reopened its operations."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agricultural land, attracted vast superficial."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of land destroyed only 690 hectares of agricultural land of Fukushima, lying in the nuclear plywood."</seg>
<seg id="566">"tourism has been recovering in two of the three prefectures, but again Fukushima remains far off again."</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist tax in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent in the same state as before the misfortune. Fukushima in contrast can only be 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung also reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next great earthquakes?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine a total picture, the newspaper introduced numerous surveys among the indigenous population and evacuated under the evacuation. she asked them about the status of the reconstruction and also, as its conception has changed over the tsunami-risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness under the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey brought that 83.1 percent of local residents, taking action taken in order to be prepared on future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of respondents find that there is still not enough of disasters in disasters."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is to be evacuated out of the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has intensified its attention also to the position of evacuated from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima didn't only experience the enormous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also witness of the worst, catastrophic disorder, nuclear accidents, and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuated out of Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"in early 2016, there were more than 23,000 people back to Fukushima in a permanent replacement country."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the 2017 level, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima out of their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"most of the evacuated areas are evacuated in the disaster zones, older than 50 years old. they are still in proper understanding, because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. here, the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games will be held in Tokyo."</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the first Nations-communities in Canada employ to deal with topics that are important to them. they do them by hip hop thanks to a number of wanderers workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan tour, mobile audio-studios have been present directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups like songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec with ten Cree-communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop group The Northstars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop will ensure that the young participants in talks on discussion topics such as" cultural identity, language, discussion, love, self-acceptable "or whatever their sense does come."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize a similar workshop with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"for example, this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a road section in Westcanada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were missing or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not explained.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemo Cree First nation uses the motif of a video game to convey, as important to traditional customs and customs, despite influences through the globalisation."</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages even though the young people don't know the languages of the First Nations in the language.</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that Whapmeoogi Cree First nation has recorded, the chorus is sung in creams."</seg>
<seg id="703">The people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly of the Northstars hip-Hop group that gave them one verse in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript as well as translation into English which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one ever interested in me.</seg>
<seg id="706">"but I'm trying to go on earth for my days,"</seg>
<seg id="707">That's the day you will take our cry.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">"but I believe that we will rise to one day,"</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media on the infamous" "fight against drug dealers" "in Mexico, the mists and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, this reflects not the extent of the human tragedy that brings together this struggle."</seg>
<seg id="750">"coverage of drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa Kartells, pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict entirely in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, somebody looks at the dream or on the municipalities that have learned to live with pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind each bone fund in the centuries-secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, their wounds may never heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político is called the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "speaking with drug dealers") that these victims should give a voice and stories by people who were talking to the struggle between prosecution authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime lets us not only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and all communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">Pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidque cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear lives") tells the story about this story.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father that searches for any weekend secret graves after his son."</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a Vivir con el narco" editors: why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We do not only need to show the faces of those who want to be afraid. we have to show the conflicts that show fragility and the sovereign power.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>

<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">"sometimes I feel like if I'm the only thing that is disgusted or sad. it seems like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body."</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he is great. and it's not normal that people listen to songs about the" heroism "of the offender, when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, that is, as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear, that something happens to them too."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories to block numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the inaction of people is incredible for me, if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified that they were" settled. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to agree, that they would fail from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and still are still."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution" "Four months of extortion in the main city district: as a family with threats issued plundered." in this, she describes how armed criminals had taken money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business, but had torn their family apart.

<seg id="799">"the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "The Forgotten Kids of Ciudad Juárez: one of violence recorded."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions such as: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a Waise and he tells us that he had to teach himself, how to make a egg boiled, potatoes, tortillas and" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of flacon with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells about the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>

<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>

<seg id="809">"Bryan was born in Bryan, the situation in Juárez looked like:"</seg>

<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the stories of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irrevocable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain the language diversity of great cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already performed events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not given to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"mass mortality of the world can be avoided, if we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces in which inhabitants don't have to forget, who they are to belong."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"often, listen to it often is to understand" beating these events instead "to appreciate, to appreciate, to link."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers ask their story first in their own language before and translating it into English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"although the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and representation is that the listeners of listening to it."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"they call laughter and emotions, than the language is no longer a barrier."</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this turn, the storytellers Rassidatou conate the opportunity to explain the storytelling of the narrative of stories."</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the fishers from the bunnies and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the meaning of his fuse, John Nyamusara is asked:" how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "with a wide grinsen, he shares his feeling of exclusiveness:"</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, which has been published last year and is licensed here, contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is an homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge will be established, and what the real cost is to do with which this is connected."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, designers and writers who have participated in the movements for free knowledge have been working on page to see over the nebula which gives our newsfeeds and create something for our different experiences."</seg>

<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the Adra prison directory where he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>

<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that, on his release, and they want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"as Bassel has paid a high price for his participation in free culture, many of us will start to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of timely extreme transitions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer of open source and digital activist has been held in prison since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military entity to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the military police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that it had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who presented himself as the insider of the Assad government and replaced them by an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">His residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively participated in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in it to expand the access to the Internet and knowledge of the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologian and at the moment the ladder of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes was more proving than the work, which he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the hub of numerous civil ties and merge Greek-Roman architectural models with hibery traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began work with this work, the IS would put it all on this architecture, which not only embodies the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this expedition into the digital archaeology and the conservation has created a period of time, which will be invaluable for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not yet close this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">"when I call his name, I am overwhelmed."</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel told me English, even as he was already in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone, who has asked. he taught others to read and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened my gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught others, as they use computer, at least theoretically, without having taken one in her hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten auf), a committee which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"they adorned the lyrics to him, when she visited him, and he translated it from the Arabic into English."</seg>

<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption, and clarifies the absence of transparency and is even a response to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have to consider is that the company should also have an disciplinary approach against the conflicting methods.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company apparently, however, seems to have no adequate legal steps for the application of the respective functions."</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to assign people with East Indian origin or in general as an adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" Kalar, "or the" "Kalar" "(in Burmese) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread issue of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radically nationalistic movements gave the word an extremely aborigination connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra nationalists as hate against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"'today' Kalar 'usually may be associated with racism, but the word is calling automatically to hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about its use of its use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings which have the same accounting sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, the chair is written on Burmese too 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(spheres),' Kalar OAT '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookies Aung Kaat declared the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends on a spiritual way, whether they knew how he could relieve his back pain by taking a word game."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase" "Cure" "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - is very similar to the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that they should decrease in hate speech radically nationalists, however, also stressed that Facebook has to be analytic before introducing all the posts that suspicion in suspicion, racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">"automation will not understand what you write on Facbeook."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what to do instead, is carefully analyzing the mail and check it by checking the opposite words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (spheres).</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these dreamt nationalists, disseminate Hasselas, receive a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while action is a powerful signal to all might send them, the efficiency of this strategy may not endure long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that censorship of buzzwords often become a cat and mouse game where users can simply start social networks to express a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaat described how Facebook began to extinguish his posts, when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned by the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new guideline of Facebook I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my mail from Facebook was removed and I got the liken, posts and sharing of contents for 24 hours, because the post" "Facebook community standards did not escape."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or trying to show their views against the hate radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech by Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post office, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious Fundamentalism are bad in the country."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more than the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to decrease racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words can only cause more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it appears as if it started this without local context or technical support, and so as" chair "or" Erbsencurry "have prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they did not attempted to report the falsely dissolved Posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefit, which make them great sales, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship handed over for a lot of mockery among the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now do so funny and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasselt to see if their posts will be taken from the net."</seg>

<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs have created a secure place for these women and made them at the same time as ambassador of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini displayed in her discussion round, was one of women who do not call their husbands in their names."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided to decide on this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"to address the name of their husbands, a brilliance must have been charged to resolve all duties and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman, who does not hold this, is regarded as a mistaken, as woman without moral."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never heard ourselves up to this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had also called her husband, was never named in the name, tried to try out how it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>

<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in our luggage, Rohini started their first discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "never before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, were protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to take discussion with a practice in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy, irritated, sad, loving and so on."</seg>

<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years, and this was the first day to whom she brought the name of their husbands over the lips," "Rohini Pac spoke out of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the centuries of centuries-old tradition in which married women to speak of their husbands" name.

<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she only turned down throughout the exercise, and another decided to release all the frustration against him and his family, putting him cursed."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in the Adrenalinople to have broken up with an ancient fires, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to call their husbands at their names."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next days, Rohini received a multitude of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"she was afraid of her mother in law, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it.</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of attendance in was less understanding and the situation artete in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of interest red puncce on the forehead, which indicates the marriage status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would bear the cinch red dot if it would also do it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"he laughed only and I listened to him, to carry him."</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women did not completely ceased, but they mean, they are now in a better position to choose himself, not to carry him on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the Discussion lub is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to worry about women, who could hear what could hear," says she. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in recent months, they celebrated their own birthdays in their lives in their lives. they danced and sang about things about which they had never thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working with these problems for so many years and yet, I have also talked about some things, such as our identities to our husbands, never so frankly."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great, certain things to say, no matter how small they happen to one."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of glory and how it is connected to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried out saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most, this is okay, but some wanted to have a sage cta, a wide Heman over a trousers; they have not dared."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of dispute and discussion on the advantages of their own dress code, morals associated with the Saris and much more, Conuggelte Rohini her own pair of Curtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round, so that women could bear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure that they will be able to create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether in the five months since her first discussion of discussion, Rohini confirms that things come slowly into the rolls:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then we stopped to say the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some of them, including me, do not make it, but only if they are alone and not other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two still say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now wearing Zinnobery on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion team know that the changes they want to reach in their lives - like the line to reach more freedom of movement or the own dress code - at the end of a hard to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving themselves mutually self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I'm also there.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"but this club, each of us, gives us the confidence that something will change."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know there is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, if every woman goes home to the club and tells anyone about what we are talking about and what we do."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam should be considered in Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">A debate has caused a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the meeting of the international branch of the Association of New York, the Minister said that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that's it, with most people go wrong."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we were different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to defend the logic in order to defend the existing authoritarian order in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, according to all our efforts and sacrificing, this valuable land, you will say that we ultimately won't be a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory injury."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"they were not very nobel by Shanmugam: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of what he appeared unobstructive."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco, or New York, equally cities that become permanent by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as you reach the key point of the subject, again the good old suffering from the authoritative Machthers, the forward Democrats, left the vertificated logic, since it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the final week, during the last week, Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests on our press, our Judikative, our political system truly non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Respective questions can be exiled with non-responses rational style.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam on his opinion, because they did not understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our advertiser K Shanmugam would take on the effort to clarify this point where it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"as Anon published his comment on the blog, he shows concerning the critics that it should start to understand the entire participation of the conference, in order to understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to those Singapore would be a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" "city" "as a country," "he declared why the elections in Singapore are so unavoidable, even if we are looking forward to free and fair elections."</seg>
<seg id="1712">He reached Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore is not a country, he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment over Shanmugam who acts as a leader of a growing generation that makes such polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Minister of Justice had said of Singapore was very confused...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old yarn, which awaits me - was I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure whether he really believes that he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review discovers the weaknesses of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"Mr. Shanmugam has committed a mistake," or was it a Freudscher? "</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we will only be considered independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, in which country the sovereign rights of the city Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique and it's equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the government of government, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they only defend their city?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay our prime minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the Journey of a Decade for the affirmation, Singapore is, and was always a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have a lot of people to have offended...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We've always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear such statements such as the defense of the country above all, etc., but that is not quite true."</seg>

<seg id="1745">"then the standard answer follows:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice-hockey, nature. "a lot of Canadians may cook inside with anger, but if they are held for Americans, but not bothered me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who does not know, there is little who distinguishes us Canadians of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">"this is one of the reasons why so many Canadians become Canadian flag well visible in their backpack, if they are traveling."</seg>
<seg id="1748">Everyone loves Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">By the way Americans....</seg>

<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first, referred to as" nice, "is basically to be mirrored - like the benevolving, gentle, but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders of" The Simpsons "(which has its own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants, who cross Europe or Latin America, some places will be known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula he is located at the border of Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is managed by a 59-year-old Mexicanerin a small woman with a pink-pink spectacle frame and gold-colored earrings in teddy bears form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called Concepción González Ramírez and grew up in Tapachula, and grew up there. yet, they know many among the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact the fact is that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a goal for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for approximately 2,50 Dollar the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with balances, brittle walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for hotel - but hundreds of African and haitian immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms. Ramírez tells, people come in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast to call it:" mum Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mom Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"currently it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some of them already slept out on cardboard."</seg>

<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and her three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, who are on the way to the United States to make regular a first stop in South America and then go towards the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other pioneers of mum Africa." mum Africa is a well-known name at the circuit, "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and the Africans often travel along the route and that Africans were already speaking on WhatsApp of Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companion, Michelet has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction workers on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"as the Brazilian economy weakened, he started his journey into the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">"since months, he has been guest at Mama Africa: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to purchase the bus to Tijuana."</seg>

<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests often send text messages when they went on to post them or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark hope for migrants traveling through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a cul-asse leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>

<seg id="1939">"he started to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after he lived for three years, he was sent out to a raid on his office from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that in Honduras with his wife and his three children fled to people who wanted to press money without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and a well-known, an all-looking, offered him her roof."</seg>

<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the cell phone users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi received a mobile pfone, which it indicates the District government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" "web cleaning"). "</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app" will allow access to access to terrorist information. "</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities decided to use the app for more than combating terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed the app shortly after they had exchanged the app."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police report that the app would determine the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, ebooks and documents."</seg>

<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protection rating with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is the blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, Trojan and Phishing sites to make users aware how much time they spend online, and to remote control their own home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">"with the filters for minors, this app will help children develop a healthy lifestyle."</seg>

<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "control unit or even hackers capable to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while talking about digital censorship in China mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger towns in the east and south, the reality is very often nozzle for those who live in remote, urgent ethnic minority groups like Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censers and surveillance measures as well as routinemissing Internet."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the Media Outlet Media Outlet" Images from Mainland China, "which published censored news in China, showed photos of a checpoint where police officers were randomized to check out whether they were installed the monitoring app."</seg>

<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that the people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned by up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>

<seg id="1986">"the rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council, to minimize the dissemination of illegal content."</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and allied institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the directives of the Cybersecurity Office in operation of their computers and communication equipment."</seg>

<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib sheds most of his time inside, and he signposted on his screen to his computer, to his computer, and again too his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"however, what one can rely on, is a cigarette between his fingers, or his with nicotine spotted lips."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house, which has been part of the West Bank since 1967; the year, in which Israel saw his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had forced to flee from her village in Palestine as felahyees (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib is a passionate activist that has been transferred to the conservative majority, and is asking her well-approved opinions about gender roles, sexuality and free expression of opinion of art and rapesmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian gearing, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics cannot be found only in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that from Damascus, to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib was looking for itself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking, and he can also suffer from their own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not make it openly, he sweeps against the American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib shows his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Taken by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib did not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to do in war zones, something with his identity as a" Palestinian gearing of the second generation "- he refers to himself even if he was born in Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own circumstances so 'stresses Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I'm a man, "while he shocked into water, Nesetan. it is the holy month Ramadan; it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims to go down from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of nutrition is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand there has a cup of coffee at a sening hot junk day little with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the slugs are loud coffee and the squadron of the Kent-cigarette into the nose in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when taking a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"so, it is easy to avoid fundamental things - as in the public during the Ramadan water - to land not in jail."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a show of the band Mashrou'Leila to the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some members of Parliament that support the Islamic branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamed Sinno, opposed the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert table was."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former spokeswoman of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the choir.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"in addition, many claim that the dedication of the band in matters such as the Arab spring, human rights and free expression of expression in the Arab world may be dangerous activism, which represents the established legitimacy authoritarian regime in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou's Leila invests the Jordanian people as a" progressive supporters of human rights, "which continues to have opted for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is probably not simply a rhetoric of rhetoric, but actually reflect a clear crystalline reality in Jordan, which is clearly reflected in Hdaibs."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib came to body traditional gender equality by taking his vision of the fate of Arab women to have voichhelichen sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a apparently broken unknown woman, whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who should actually trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of Honor's Honor - the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch stated that the number of Honour of Honour in 2016 reached its zenith; however, the institutional infrastructure is still missing to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence to support the appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law for fragile control from 1954, women who are subjected to the risk of inner family violence can be imprisoned, and for their release is often a year-long bureaucratic effort and the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for it, to reverence the issues that are long as tabu in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, is a dream that he can separate his music that is full of explicit attachments on sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"he was intimidated to me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question about the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs that are politically, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and each other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a sort of market in which one can find in His words," that can be what one wants, "whether it is faith or not believe, Hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that there is hardly any one in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbian and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were still very censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib initiated an interview for the popular Jordanian OnlineProgramme Roya, to remember that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but he was only a working version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance of homosexuals does not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nua, a poet from the eighth century, who still has remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib was wondering: if Abu Nuvo, who was later to work on behalf of the Caliph, could write in the eighth century openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanians do it?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the actual problem so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou's Leila, or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemic kingdom, it is nothing new that the government attacks against free expression of expression and that progressive votes to silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service took several former government officials and members of the teacher's association, with the reasoning, they had expressed themselves on comments in social media critical to the problems that were deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of what is the Hdaibs concert, only the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is an independent entity. Jordan has denied Mashrou's Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it looks too slow, thinking and internally changes. it is certain that these changes took place in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"finally, Hdaib lived here as millions of other Arabs, from a Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience" them. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is inspired by music, art and literature of a real and fundamental openness - and not through bombs, spreading unitions and on artificial fashion. at least he hopes."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until now, Hdaib will continue to rip and demise resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was shown by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman listens to a student Fellow. "</seg>

<seg id="2150">These great, extravagant war dolls are so fantastic!!! "</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one assumes that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in many neighborhoods in August. another theory states that the wagons, the drums and dancing more than a thousand years, came from the West Japan in the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi in force."</seg>

<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, there is for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only True - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to the experienced hands of hairdressers in the experienced hands of hairdressers."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the outer borders of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the post-bike message "love messages to guerrilla fighters" which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This post is published here in the context of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write permission to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not so much more important to meet people who have stumbled, affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question went to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to write the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation) who encourages young people to supple guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently, her country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement of FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which constitutes the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered to be a sign of the peace agreement as such significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"there is still a long way ahead of Colombian, until one can speak of real reconciliation and reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who lived for many years in illegal camps, have been exposed to a war rhetoric and carried out their weapons in their lives, and have to reintegrate themselves into the life of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian company again, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred versus guerrilla fighters, must now record their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian would have to close together with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly what did they do: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them again in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters, which should be handed over to personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letter on reconciliation was formed at the World Summit of Peace Laureate, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk short with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we love the people we love to write on Valentine's Day, thousands of love, but those who need to need much more unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plane, he continued to share his love with people in this year, who needed the urgent feedback."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was created, letters full of hope and assistance to former fighters of the FARC, which now find their place in society and to create a new life." "the letters are showing that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of peace to a common history of peace." "</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters were collected in the context of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC presented themselves as they did earlier, to oppose the commands of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no commands but letters of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all those involved." it's incredible how many different emotions you can run through just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between, "said the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, a former fighter caused me to be the camp of guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of tent in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go, because beside him on the bed a MGL pomegranates, a deadly weapon in the thorn."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I asked him, saying," Hello, what are they doing? "he answered," I reply to a letter which someone has written. ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"ever in my life someone has written something so nice, so I answer it." then, suddenly, tears came about the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him whole and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for war, he was sorry for all the years of loyal companion to this struggle, and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life than war. at the FARC, the only way to preserve it and his six brothers in front of starvation." I never thought someone would forgive myself for my fault. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">"now, I know that there is a society outside there, waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have learnt just how I must handle weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace is over, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the first time, students and some of the FARC came together on a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up and the FARC already lived in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC explained the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" many years have experienced how we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country just. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"the goal of this magnitude is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who have never found Homr before, and to recognise that people who were often seen as a monster, and even hate living only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their lives and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the land lives, hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me, that all men - even those who have killed and caused much harm to give us a smile and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the Archbishop of the City of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian has been shown that after deforestation peace would rule peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment possibilities, there will always be people who are ready to lift up and to protest against their rights and that is completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"by the FARC, we now rely on peace, politics without arms."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all the Defenders of Peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they listen - to rise over all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. among us who can defend the life as foundation of existence, many difficulties will be imminent."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way, there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2251">Since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">"she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for them, so she went to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after having experienced a group of Chechens of gender equality, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"from fear for her life, she attracted the last end to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helferin at a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"one day, I told me that someone needed my help."</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took them without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone thought of whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. so he wiped them to his chetchnya friends, with the following message:" then there is no men more in Chechnya, who can eliminate this disgrace? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents started with the WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">"on 10 October 2015, I was attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just doing there, I heard a couple of shops from the back seat of my car, I heard a manhood:" here is a gift for you of your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"as I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I did nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a set, but this time on Chechen:" how long will you honor the family, you shorthand? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>

<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and awoke last end in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had heard everything and began to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>

<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two colon in my right lung wings.</seg>

<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor stood up and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>

<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I received threats."</seg>

<seg id="2283">"the slowed, send me back to Chechnya to prove that everything was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they set absurd claims: some said me, I have to prove it, going up without through the streets; others wanted me that I had not changed to the official TV in Grosny, that I had not changed my gender, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have baseline size C - what would I have to say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this print?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people said to my mother at the street.</seg>

<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I asked to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't believe about, you're in safety, just because you have left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"we know, in which hotel you steckst. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still contact your family in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about sex equality, this is a tabutheme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"some traditional Caucasian elements, I still bear in myself."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"so much I wish it, I cannot overcome this seelic barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to do it."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give myself effort to look like the person to look out of her past, that is, my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I was talking to someone who took one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan had not been arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he concluded a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Now they will concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"with this, my I, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end, demand a proof that the so-called" glory "has experienced by blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are men still gay men in these secret prisons now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend of mine, there would be not many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, especially those who have no rich relatives, or those of their relatives dropped in order to set the Kadyrows court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there to present it later than terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim they had attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these men were not simply missing, but targeted in to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that now only a guess or have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was incarcerated in Argun for a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was involved, when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, they were not introduced as bandits, there have been no reports yet. we assume that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed to shave with these people?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people who have heard a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, have already arrived in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've been wearing my hair always long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Grosny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us to the civil society" civil society, "but ultimately cast us back into the stoneage."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were pinned; I had coloured eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety of the Scharia never has a hair curved to me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that is: "carrot not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"they often say, often to children, when they do so funny about sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just shut up their eyes off you, because they believed, they were ill?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulting me, never chased, and never struck."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this subject matter?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: for so long until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was named Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking on morality on TV."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us by se, but above the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel the people in the city were beginning to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who laughed and laughed in advance, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in the meantime, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came home, I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly worsen."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what work do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I'm working as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn too much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the USA are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still working as a activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I comment on them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teetreffs, collars, I lead them to the hospital and help them to get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't leave a penny for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people himself when I took refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">"I am the Muslim, and want to help those who need help."</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear an Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alder.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so, nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no pigs."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have what, the cabardiner have, which, the Russians also have, are they - but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it's unpleasant to hear something."</seg>
<seg id="2387">"here, I meet so many men out of the Caucasus."</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasten during Ramadan fasten - live with men together.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about transcendity to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his family to make more intimate experiences. but that's a decaying."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of feelings, to be precise, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry I am so personal, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am myself myself.</seg>

<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, which is based in the majority of the Arab people living in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to dispute its habitat."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"in a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the ahlavi monarchy took power and gained great efforts in 1925 that ethnic autonomy come down throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest in Iran-coming oil and gas fields, as well as some of the most influential and most valuable materials for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the native population gets only little of this wealth."</seg>

<seg id="2416">"Ahwazi Arabians has been refusing systematically jobs in the local oil, gas, and petrochemical industries."</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not cooperate with feminism, also with the intersection"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photos. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is an revised version of the opinion which was written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of Afroféminas. this article was the subject of several discussions in which many positions came up.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say that I am not a feminist, many women respond to many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even thought well-thought scientific and social reasoning from me, why I should be feminist and why we generally ask all feminist * inside."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women still earn less money in spite of equal education."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still stand under stringent observation when it comes to what they can do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social standards are still responsible for that women, sooner or later, in various areas of life to a glittering blanket, and that discrimination based on the sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and threefold less.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: if I come to talk to skin color, racism, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBT community or on black women from the diaspora; if I suppose that we are always found under racism and suffering from the feminist movement, both in and outside of feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists were silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, they all agree that women - all women should come together to sing" their voices, "to sing" Kumbaya, my lord "to sing the equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about it, that in addition to sexualised violence is a motivated form of rassistic violence, which we are black women to double-point."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or about that black women and women of other ethnicities and games are less likely to earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as a white girl, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spouses and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk of domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on one hand, I wish that all men, all men and all men have any skin colour of the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join the same rights as black woman who refuses to consider unjustification in their thinking, which refers to gender and skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and won't fight for my belonging in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always turned me, and countless other black women and always turned down again."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" "am I no wife?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginal essence."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join me groups who also absorb our customs and customs, in order to advance their egoeccentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to learn white women over the importance of overcuts of skin colour and gender. for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to teach them better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was established to give women a home to women, and renounce of white feminism, is still the word" feminism "in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to resolve me full and entirely of feminism and put me on the movement of Womanism, who was brought to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that interfering is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it's more important than ever, that we can define black women in our own performances and put us into the spheres which can be created by us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana, urism: Reclaiming Ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves - and not only that - black women may also bear spaces in which they can make ourselves totally secure and even the spiritual elements that make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will call Separatism and exclusion after having read these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a bluristic environment, I can lift up black women and women of other cultures, because I exist in this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment in which my life did not survive, nor ignored, nor turned down."</seg>

<seg id="2469">"ever again, Nabil Musa traveled over the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in the canoe - with a special issue through the Iraqi Kurdistan region. its mission aims to make people conscious of clean waters for present and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in its community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was still a child," Musa tells Musa. "</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all the country fear that the decades of war, construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq."</seg>

<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarises the pressures and importance of his work in a question:" if we don't have any water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was filmed and published for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, Iraq and multi-media journalist, filmed and published."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and processed version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of turally. the article is part of the series # PorSerMujer (# temporary female subjects) who reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner said Ada Báez that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her expartner who had become violent across violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship was a little time passed and the police said, her statement would be laid to the acts, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as a further wife Balbuena showed for failing, the acclaimed display of Ada Báez did nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second wife moved her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women receive an ad at all, they don't receive support from the State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to admit victim of violence at all in the prosecution authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"Insert 1 strokes and Statiiken2 Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that has nothing to malimmed 3 Paraguay laws: good approach, lacking realisation and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it's hard to see how many women are really harassed, Myrian González, researcher for gender issues on Centro de Documentación y Egyms, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay." there are different data and reports that do not even indicate the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay, "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"the numbers available, however, are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the Public Prosecutor of Attorney met 9600 ads for domestic violence. 70% of them went about violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the peace of peace. 86% of the ads came from women too.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisement, 40% of women reported that they were physically abused, 55% of women talked of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"these statistics, however, do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayan women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated." on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women are not doing this. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"for every woman refunded for physical abuse, there are two women who do not do this," she explained at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"as women's murder in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, law enforcement agencies cannot be documented, as many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"only until August 2016, journalists in the country counted at least 12 cases of women in land."</seg>
<seg id="2501">"the Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women have been murdered by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violent men."</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible Missions and a legal system that undertakes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera that she named him the names of all their former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">"at the beginning, she did not want to do that, but then she should repent."</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer have died with Carlos. but for two years she bore the psychic force on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would have never thought that I would have a victim of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"if I have read earlier about it, I thought that this only thing that happens to submissive, because they are disillusioned by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, they wrote contributions on Facebook where they described his insults and various attacks during their two years relationship and told how he had isolated it."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetortic, whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had fallen so long by Carlos, and did not leave it earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">It was almost like they wanted to say that victim of abuses at least had some complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was harassed."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo-CREO network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in any way of abuses.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk with others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the testimony of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias ads by the authorities, without a result and from their relatives, they received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"it led a process against its former partner who developed into an unmanageable legal fight between Paraguay and their home country, where it mainly went about money, power and the influence of their former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay laws: good approach to lack of implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the display of abuses is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, sees great problems with the use of laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorElla (# Fürst)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # Nixmenos (# NonJust Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by amnesty International.</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the US to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this contribution of Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton breed in the United States since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outreddish, the first plant grown by NASA astronauts in the space and has been consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Mortons had worked only by his own income and the question of how many salads he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more and more salaries were patented, and that he could not continue to use it for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only for individual varieties but also for certain characteristics, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or mixed sheets."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years more of such patents have been registered for more plants, such as cereals or cartons. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmental protection and experts provide food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of one millennia-old tradition, Morton is still a salad, but it is now longer necessary because his work is still worth further."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as if in a river a boulders are lying around which I must swaddling."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a split with the breeding" tradition, "he says." I think these patents go to salads too far. "</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before the court, no one can breed any more salaries, because all characteristics are already patented". "he makes so good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and endeavourable to use no material being protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also been connected to a movement connected to the United States and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have been cultivated and eaten red Römersalat the variety Outreddish in the greenhouse gas station and eaten. there will be tested if plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like this, as would stem from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open-Source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software to provide alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property, and are usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can also undertake that others can use the farmed seed-free."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they can't continue to make business with their seed and we can sell it." open source "breeders only allow others who buy seeds to breed it, and it will not immediately come out - two aspects that are forbidden by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seeds have already joined the initiative in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emerald professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi, Jack Kloppenburg must control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seeds plays a role in large merger such as Biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to use the latter not or just a little to use, by rejuvenating seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture, or not." to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, "as for example, we need control over seeds in the global agricultural industry, as well as for example on farms may also know how this vegetable is bred to be threatened."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"nutrition, without seed, is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertook to provide other crops freely available, with that, in contrast, its progress can be patented in contrast to its seed and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argued that the future of food supplies will be at risk, as the available indoor pool due to the increasingly large-looking intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always reduced."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, a Director of Ossi, has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found that approximately one-third of all-party features are protected as intellectual property, making it either not even usable in plants."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, there are not such estimates yet, but experts such as Luby suggest that massaging plants like wheat in larger style are patented as salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of View</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so farmed that they have targeted entities - from such as their taste or its color improves until such as they thrive in certain environments such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">"patents of Patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is steadily increasing by more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changing conditions are predictable by climate change much worse."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-Sprecher Carly Scaduto recognize that genetic diversity is generally important and crucial for Monsantos's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and the United States, use the company for the conservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it says that intellectual property promote other breeders, since" patents and the protection of plant varieties "promote innovation." "a patent is essentially taken as soon as the patent has expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these statements help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"so, such protection will not prevent innovations, but it promotes the public more material and know-how available to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks like this: for 20 years, until a patent of patent, certainly no innovations will be conveyed."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for such a long time to grow on plants, which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument of Morton is that genetic resources always have been a general well and it should remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to help farmers work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will be impossible to us if we are not able to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interferes with the concept to patented plant features:" we do not create the characteristics. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them, and as breeders we don't have any idea how plants do this."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding:" whoever catches a variety, also put his own values into them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"anyone who believes in industrial agriculture, with big farms and monocultures, are needed to cultivate herbicides, breeding into his varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is precise. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than for Monsanto are) patents, they can survive most smaller seed companies - either do they reject and do it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile, or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plantation Frank Morton takes place in his breeding garden Salad in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the opinion that breeders caused by avoidance of plant patrons," It looks like I think with my efforts to produce new things, stronger than companies that are patenting. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need a new material for my catalog, as I know my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years," says he. "with a patent it is protected for 20 years prior to the competition, with which in my opinion it is quite easy."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the United States seem to be leading the" open source "breeding, the concept is now spreading throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is an" open source "seed range. to ensure the seed of traditional crops, the centre with farmers worked together to breed new varieties."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seed and sell its own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol is working on an" open-source "license, which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of Ossi commitment to breeder in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding differ from land to land, absent because of the Ossi obligation, not one can be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventional farmed plants should not be patentable. thus she speaks against the present practice of the European Patent Office, which patents are based on conventional farmed plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, a statement is not yet a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to adopt the Patent Office to implement these new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos organised a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators and representatives from governments, non-governmental organizations and representatives from all East Africa to learn about the" Open Source "seed movement and global trend towards the sponsoring of seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's program for" Open Source "seed systems that the organization is currently offering a worldwide alliance to" open source "seed systems, for the scheduled next year of the official starting signal."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a combination of environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development organisation USC Canada and the action group for Erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity around the world to publish a seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a consortium of auxiliary agencies such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - published a report. in this, it represents the opinion that farmers have the opportunity to share it and improve the seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report will also emphasize the importance of a diverse, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between Luby von Ossi hopes that soon more people will recognize him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods is especially respected, where and how something is grown, and seeds systems have hardly played any role, so Luby." we are trying to make people clear that even more behind their food. "</seg>
