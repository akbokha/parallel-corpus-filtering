that is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize in New York @-@ Times reporter .
&quot; long before someone had heard about Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which it was spectacular that the NSA have illeg@@ ally heard illegal phones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
&quot; therein , he describes a dis@@ astro@@ us U.S. secret service operation in which the CIA had literally broken designs for nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but you know who didn &apos;t like this chapter right ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government against R@@ isen was determined and urged him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; on this train , he became the symbol of the pattern of the government , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and to prosec@@ uting journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitu@@ tions , the media have the right to publish the secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media is not able to protect these information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ ters , they are reason@@ ably priced . &quot;
&quot; so , when the government arrived at R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous journalists did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was thus living with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something unusual happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though , for years , it would be essential for their fall , the government &apos;s demands were dropped by R@@ isen . &quot;
the reason : during the period of electronic monitoring the reporter and sources can hide themselves less .
&quot; instead of failure and rub@@ bers to make statements , this may also do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his permission , is concerned with his phone , &quot;
&quot; just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and banana information , its credit card , and even travel tips with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA w@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and ris@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , it is just one of many cases . &quot;
President Obama promised with his lawyer to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer . but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has more condem@@ ns than all US governments in front of him .
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government supports much of their work as home . &quot;
&quot; since 11 September , almost every article about national security was the result that a whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so , we place the press coverage of the game that will be protected by the first Constitutional Treaty , because the government has more possibilities to con@@ struct all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the technology of the government allows to b@@ ypass the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; indeed , they can record from the moment in which they contact , instead of inside , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that had not been written when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is considerably more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transmission system for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer that was originally developed by Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , which was originally developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post here . &quot;
&quot; you can also upload documents or send documents , as in any ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , which only has access to the news agency access . &quot;
&quot; so , the government cannot find out more information secretly , and many of the information that would request it would not be available from the out@@ set . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world develop new spy technologies that are all dangerous to us . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s ensuring that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to make abuse . it &apos;s just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , &quot;
&quot; who wants to report about abuse of soldiers who wants to report a humble and over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm for the contam@@ inated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who warns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies have not only been made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest data network of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that Rei@@ che and M@@ igh@@ ty &#93; &#91; We asked Robert Pal@@ mer by Global Wit@@ ness to have a statement . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s local law firm Fon@@ se@@ ca . &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we will get an impression of it , such as customers , banks and lawyers as a mus@@ k Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you do that ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already lead to the very first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has stepped down .
&quot; also , there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ sach@@ al @-@ Assad Off@@ ers in tax ha@@ v@@ ens has . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars on Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin will take a close friend of child days , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of more rich people and others , which are nervous to wait for the next publication , and to the next revealed documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of a agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems , cri@@ es away from you , to me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we apply this ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all taxes to pay , then this means lower money for important public services such as health care , education , streets . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; media and leading politicians are discussing media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens of some few are used to hide and conce@@ de their wealth -- something we have been discussing and un@@ veil for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people will seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine a mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so one company has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult to understand law en@@ forcement and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what is . &quot;
I also find it interesting that in the US there are less reports about this matter .
&quot; presumably because there were no prominent Americans , who came to this sc@@ andal in these revel@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; however , through the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data center of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states to set up a company to establish a company as a library document . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparent in the USA has allowed the employees of school districts .
&quot; it has permitted bet@@ ting , especially vulnerable inc@@ ers . &quot;
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to figure out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent investig@@ ative investig@@ ators in the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ators gave himself as an African minister , who wanted to bring the susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht to buy a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really sho@@ cked us , that all through to a lawyer from our investig@@ ator could make suggestions , how he could transfer@@ ring his money . &quot;
&quot; all these were pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate . no one of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course , no one was handed over to this system . but it shows the problem with that system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as single cases .
it is not about a single attor@@ ney that spreads proposals for our missing investig@@ ator .
&quot; it does not go about a single top , wound up in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works closely with corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; all this may sound very comfor@@ ting , as if we could do nothing about it ; as if nothing is ever changed ; as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but , as a gebor@@ g optim@@ ist , I certainly see that some has begun to change . &quot;
&quot; in the past couple of years , we have seen many transparency to greater transparency , affecting the owners of firms . &quot;
&quot; the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland . &quot;
&quot; since then the EU has been recorded in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US could go back here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have adopted a bill in both par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama dis@@ closures , this vast insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and global for more transparency . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are mad when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lights .
we need executives in the economy that arise and say : &quot; In@@ do is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and to finish it through the laws of in@@ transparent .
&quot; together , we can finally finish this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
this is the story of how I was ab@@ duc@@ ted almost once and in the boot of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after I had completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my master@@ pieces .
he was alone in the city and made a road trip through the whole country . thereafter he would go to the Peace scor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing even worse , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleep place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him only ! he says that he would go to the Peace of Peace , but I don &apos;t know whether he is really planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the boot of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small boot !
&quot; then I heard me say , &quot; I have a air mat@@ rat@@ ze . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head , said : &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night , I was in bed , I star@@ ed to the ceiling , and thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot;
a wild bo@@ ar sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such fear that I got out of the bed , at Z@@ eh@@ en@@ tops to the door , and my sleep door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the work of art , which he purchased from me , depends on his class@@ room . he is now teachers . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my view angle .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as foreigners , actually friends who were waiting for waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accommodate people on my air mat@@ ri@@ pen , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mat@@ rat@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; let us make a jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost ple@@ xed , my ro@@ omm@@ ates and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were booked out .
&quot; I think , creativity can create , fear in fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ches@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment will stay with a designer Bed and and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , WiFi and a desk inclusive , with a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and founded &quot; air mat@@ rat@@ ze and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at wooden floors for 20 dollars on wood floors .
they found it super and we too .
&quot; I am sure , our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ ettes were completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we were talking to our last guest , and the door to the castle came , rever@@ ting Brian and I joined us . &quot;
did we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rent ?
things came into rolls .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ates , N@@ ate Ble@@ ad czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if one could make a business concept .
&quot; so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a web site , on the people public images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind room , whose doors are close when visiting . &quot;
&quot; via the Internet , they can then invite foreign foreign people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but she did not put them .
&quot; no one who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allowed strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we all have learned as children that foreigners are dangerous .
&quot; if one has a problem , one can rely on the things you can do . we were designed to design . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just look and h@@ ap@@ tic -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create trust in design , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
&quot; I would like to give you a taste sample , what degree of confidence we cons@@ ented . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
&quot; now , I like to advise you to unlock your mobile phone . &quot;
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone your left seat .
this silent impulse from panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what you feel when you open the door .
&quot; the only thing , when your mobile phone is your mobile phone , is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they watch your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
most guests feel better if they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like that who has actually got Al Go@@ res mobile now ?
&quot; could you be aware of Twitter , that he would support the Presidency of the President ? &quot;
you can return the cell phone now .
you have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor should have shown at once with his name ; if he had told how he comes his dog or his children ?
&quot; imagine , you would have 150 ass@@ essments , who all say : &quot; he can really hold on cell phones very well ! &quot;
how would you feel if you would have to hand your cell phone ?
because a well @-@ done feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we got some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative conclusions .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given her assessment before being ordered online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how they are similar to age and residence . &quot;
little surprising we trust the people most that are similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add to a person &apos;s call -- in our case due to ass@@ essments .
&quot; if one has less than three denomin@@ ations , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , changing everything . &quot;
a good reputation for simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so the correct design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
&quot; in addition , we knew that trust is dependent on how much you are reason@@ ably priced . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
&quot; if one tells you , how &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you do not get an answer . &quot;
&quot; we are talking too much , like for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted either . &quot;
&quot; so , there is an optimal degree of op@@ enn@@ ess , e.g. &quot; T@@ olle &apos;s art@@ works in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot; &quot;
how can I create it with design to create this degree of op@@ enn@@ ess ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also provide tips on which topics you should write .
&quot; our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help , to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers . &quot;
&quot; with what we didn &apos;t reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than ready to disman@@ tle those pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; here , see how many people take our offer . &quot;
one can recognize three things .
first : unbelie@@ v@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that had not been bred before .
for us the business is running very well .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who celebrated un@@ allowed parties or devast@@ ated homes .
guests have to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the fore@@ front front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts if I just think of it .
&quot; dis@@ appointment , which you hear in the voice of the An@@ gol@@ fer , was and will always be our biggest motivation to improve on us . &quot;
luck@@ ily of the 123 million nights only a fraction had ever been a problem .
because people trusted one another .
&quot; if trust works , wonders may arise . &quot;
one of our guests did vacation in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack there .
his host drove him to hospital .
he even donated blood on the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers , who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot;
the area is beautiful and furnished with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Alej@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angel that save lives , even though they do not know at all . &quot;
&quot; you are driving a hospital in your own car , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want to feel embar@@ rass@@ ing , they bring together books . &quot;
&quot; they can even stay longer , without charging the extra @-@ night . &quot;
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , not every stay . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; for the first time I stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the thought of part work together with money transactions ?
it &apos;s all about an economic trading .
&quot; but it is now simply to call the &quot; &quot; lease industry &quot; , &quot; the thing will not be justified . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel nowadays , this is to be compared with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic . &quot;
but what would happen if traveling a rich buffet of local income ?
&quot; what would be , if at any place , which one visited , a group there would wait for a thor@@ ough to fill a thor@@ ough and one of a bar @-@ winding neighborhood , of which one has never heard ; &quot;
or if you could learn from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to make homes of reason to be shared ?
what would that look like ?
what would be to accept the minds of the common share ?
&quot; I imagine the cities that make us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and depreciation . &quot;
&quot; this project has already started in South Korea in Seoul . a lot of parking spaces that belonged to the government , &quot;
&quot; now the residents were offered . students who were looking for a stay , were offered , &quot;
&quot; they were convey@@ ed in people whose children were out . they were incub@@ ators , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , via our platform , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be host to a fore@@ igner or even hosts . &quot;
so the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was taught us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
&quot; even before it was hospitality , too . &quot;
there were similar sites in front of us .
so why has just made our work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the correct design with the issues of confidence . &quot;
design can help us to overcome profound pre@@ ju@@ dice .
&quot; I think that amaz@@ ingly , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
&quot; of course , we know that design can not solve every problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , a brain la@@ under@@ wear , a terror ? &quot;
or simply a delay in security door at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; so , the media represent the media that look like me . &quot;
a study showed that 80 % of reporting about Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; to all those who have never met a Muslims , it is great to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- dou@@ bly espresso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
a se@@ d@@ ant @-@ like @-@ fan@@ ati@@ cian , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I decided to choose .
I was 17 when I was 17 when I was 17 .
&quot; no , not as homosex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ust@@ ige was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , with the pressure that I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I felt a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have the Qur &apos;@@ an .
&quot; I read it , thought , reas@@ oned in question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow de@@ vot@@ ion who deep@@ ened himself with each reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; ever had you ever feel that someone has perc@@ ei@@ ving you completely , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
it feels like that .
&quot; later , I married and began like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineering . &quot;
&quot; later I had , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot;
then the terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; in my kitchen I was sitting in my kitchen , looked at the end . looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Breaking News . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people spread out of the buildings . &quot;
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly in indig@@ nation .
why should I do something like that ?
&quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... , &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; not only my country was attacked , but in the N@@ u changed the works of others from a civil war in a susp@@ icious . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to travel through the Middle East from the United States to start a new town and begin studying the post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as we drove me -- as we got silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time to be recognized as Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved in this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and when I heard , I read and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Abi@@ de in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Be not deceived . &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
&quot; then it was Friday in that week -- the day , where Muslims will gather to the prayer . &quot;
&quot; and again the war@@ nings , &quot; &quot; Is not this first Friday , the mosque could be a destination . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were un@@ disturbed , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were for Muslims , were crushed and struck . &quot;
there really was fire suggestions on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt wasn &apos;t felt right .
&quot; because the people who attacked this country , have attacked our country . &quot;
I got the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in that country -- it &apos;s called Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and include mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as from a tumor in the body of the USA .
it just raises the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is known as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all the Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , educ@@ ators and Olymp@@ ians . &quot;
will the closure of Mos@@ che@@ en America be safer ?
&quot; maybe there will be a few parking lots , but not stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit to a mosque leads to regard people other faith , toler@@ ant , and greater civil participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a director of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alized in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in the bed before a computer .
&quot; the radic@@ alization process has found that it begins online . as a result , the person is cut off from their congregation , even from their family so that the extre@@ mi@@ ist can make a brain wash , and everyone who ab@@ hor@@ red the terrorists are real Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ hor@@ red their behaviour and ide@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we need to stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to us in their imagination when you recognize it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an to Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology according to their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when you throw a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scri@@ ptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into the Scri@@ ptures .
a great I@@ mam told me recently an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she would have been invited to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy concerning whom she spoke , she brought to silence and told her that her anger , her mind for in@@ justice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had been given to their anger , she was a major goal for the Instrument@@ alisation by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised to a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam set the connection to God and to their church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ use for their anger , he showed construc@@ tive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; she learned what she learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS . &quot;
that was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family concerns me .
but how does normal Americans work out ?
how does it affect everyone ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
&quot; a study -- actually several neuro@@ science studies -- demonstrate : if we fear ourselves , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; rather , we accept a author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : when one assumes test individuals , in which negative about Muslims was reported that they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as to the circumcision of American Muslims . &quot;
that is not only an acute problem .
&quot; if you look , when the mood against Muslims pushed forward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up of Iraq war and during two voting periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; in fact , there can be a tool for manipulation of the public to ev@@ ap@@ point the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear harm us all .
&quot; in the assignment of collective responsibility , it is not only about to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
&quot; he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the most sweet , most generous person who knew her . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when has been such a sealed young man from my stock ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ zanne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had posted in the afternoon , after he had posted an statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he shot eight times at De@@ ah .
fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque or abo@@ de at home safely ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision , because it was about what America would want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear or one , in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided to the mosque .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat we drove silence to the mosque .
&quot; I took him out , and pulled out my shoes , went into the building hall , and what I saw , left me . &quot;
the hall was filled out .
&quot; then the im@@ am made an announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , because half of the meeting were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and not believers who had come to attack us , but to join us . &quot;
&quot; in this moment , I am broken together . &quot;
these people were there because they had courage and compassion .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ at@@ ism ?
will you go down to number sure ?
or will you connect to those that mean : we are better than that .
thank you so much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen W@@ ters : so D@@ alia - you seem to have a ner@@ v hit .
&quot; but I wonder what do you say that you are saying that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk to work a thought with deep step in a noble thinking , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say you don &apos;t fool . I am completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; if you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever undertaken investigation of Muslims around the world , people want to meet normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in any way an exception .
&quot; if people appear as an exception as a rule , the rule is often broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ist started to become a billi@@ on@@ aire .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research facilities worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before the air @-@ package into our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of flight machines in the Fra@@ c@@ Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks in France . some years ago they began to fly with ro@@ pes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting devices , flight sets high speed and acceleration to the top space . &quot;
they can also build self @-@ bearing structures .
they have learned to carry loads of turbul@@ ences and react with turbul@@ ences and generally respond to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possibility of an autonomous flight .
&quot; to make a system autonomous , it must be known colle@@ c@@ tively know where there are mobile objects in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ET@@ H Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; every flying machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level , e.g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter .
&quot; a flight device , which tries to beat two flies with one fl@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; like other starters , it is efficient in the down@@ ward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most strong fle@@ xes , it can ho@@ ver , and thus it has great advantages with start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a swe@@ eping side . &quot;
a lim@@ bs of tail@@ or is that they react sensiti@@ v@@ ous to turbul@@ ences as wind co@@ res .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
&quot; the idea behind it is that the air device doesn &apos;t matter in what position is the optimum position , and improve the performance by practic@@ ing . &quot;
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask the fundamental abstract questions that penet@@ rate to the core of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to answer the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are roughly known as machines with a thousand mobile parts , that joined together to viol@@ ate you . &quot;
&quot; before decades , trained pilots could fly remot@@ ely controlled flying devices that had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ dder . &quot;
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est control unit . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; only one moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no valves , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , just a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; even though it &apos;s mechan@@ ically simple , it happens in the inner life very much , so that it can fly stable and can move in the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the ta@@ vern . to make it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right . &quot;
&quot; the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood , to throw it right , is minimal , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is a practice in pleas@@ ur@@ ities , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ ric .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the utmost ability , &quot;
&quot; in the room to move in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even like it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly to flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; if flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate twin prop@@ ellers .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter@@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build it together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , electronics or a battery - can fly the machine if restricted . &quot;
we will demonstrate that by doing half of air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration examined synthetic she@@ er .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
&quot; we acquired standard micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alization technology and algorith@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , these demonstrations contribute to re@@ thinking about new revolutionary ideas . &quot;
the especially secure machine da dr@@ ens would like to be a flying lamp screen on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types , like us , the salary is in the development and the train act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a memory , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart gifts to form them in a spectacular way . &quot;
&quot; the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the bag is on the i . &quot;
thank you so much .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes have been around one far away in a very far distant future . they turned into pure energy as the mass of three black holes in pure energy . &quot;
this short moment brigh@@ tly brigh@@ tly brigh@@ tly brigh@@ ter than all the stars in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big pop .
but they set up their power but not in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given in the space @-@ time feelings and the universe explo@@ ded gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; then , we arrange the events in time . &quot;
&quot; more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell lives were born on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has produced some more : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stand at -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; some 25 years ago , a group of particularly brave -- Ra@@ i Weiss by MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ger from C@@ alt@@ ech -- are looking for a huge laser detector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational black holes . &quot;
most of them held them crazy .
but enough people recognized it as crazy gen@@ ies so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ inter@@ fer@@ ometric Gra@@ vit@@ ational Ob@@ servatory . &quot;
&quot; during the follow @-@ up time , the precision of Lig@@ o was significantly enhanced , which improved the detection capacity enorm@@ ously . &quot;
therefore you called him Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify several smaller , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ation waves of the two col@@ li@@ di@@ zed black holes through the earth through . &quot;
they went through you and me
and through the detector itself .
Scott Hughes : only two moments in my life were emotional than these :
the birth of my daughter
and the goodbye to my daughter &apos;s father .
&quot; basically , these were the fruits of my life . &quot;
all that I had worked for what I worked is not longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been exam@@ ines gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their ob@@ servatory like Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cr@@ us@@ al in the emotions of space and time .
&quot; when crossing the shaft , the space and its overall content are stretched in a direction and into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative studies , lec@@ turers in courses at rel@@ ativity theory often lead a correct al@@ ber@@ y dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sty , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridic@@ ulous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us year@@ ns and gest@@ ed at the meeting of the waves . the reminder of an average people was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means that 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the Lig@@ o staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length must be measured on less than a thousand of the radius of a nuclear @-@ nu@@ cle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about Gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne described a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves in the following way : &quot; the technical difficulties when construction of such detectors are tremendous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cist are inv@@ entive and with the support of the public , all obstacles are overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims that Lig@@ o is more than an ear than one eye .
I would like to explain what this signi@@ fies .
&quot; visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phones . &quot;
&quot; this is quite convenient , because you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points . &quot;
&quot; with killing , that is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore , it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that make you very much : &quot;
the face of your child is about .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties such as pitch , pitch , rhythm , and volume , to close the history behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , Alice &apos;s talking about . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; grief Bob , &quot;
same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t make a simple pictures of objects in all of them .
&quot; however , in terms of changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least there are measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we convert wave pattern to sound , we can hear the all literally . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott worked very long . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circul@@ ate simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two body very quickly , one hears the same circle with an additional clay @-@ change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu . &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render of sound &#93; J@@ no one knows what he needs to hear this as a sound from -- SH : ... two black holes , each rotate as quickly as the sticks of your Mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : if we consider ourselves what this signi@@ fies .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 S@@ uns , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine this forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard .
this is the permanent importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before .
on this way we can listen to all sounds and the invisible .
&quot; much in all , we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- not . &quot;
Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mass@@ aging stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about them all .
&quot; but in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon hides . &quot;
we will never see through that these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would explore transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the Ur@@ b@@ alle is covered by its own post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; through gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optimi@@ stic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen , that we will never see , and of which we have no idea that we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found the first point of things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague on MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars that produce black holes , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . so , the black holes are the vacuum bone of our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o allows us to view a completely different perspective on the events of the universe , based on the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
&quot; AA : the challenge is now , as cour@@ ageous as it is possible . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and li@@ stens to the rust@@ les and circles of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ atories -- a brand new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ at@@ ories on Earth and All .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now the time is great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; for one year , I would say &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of whom I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter whether it made me nervous , brought me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me &quot; Yes &quot; to say . &quot;
would I speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to live live on television ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , no , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; a crazy thing happened : that exactly what I was afraid , when I was afraid , my fear was afraid . &quot;
&quot; my fear , speech@@ es , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; me . &quot;
but there was a certain Ye@@ ah that changed my life to un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; kit@@ ties , &quot;
as she would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; Bi@@ bs , I need milk for my re@@ mun@@ eration . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once , whether I could play with her , when I was straight on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; a new life setting in my family . from there , I swear to always play with them as soon as you look for me . no matter what I &apos;m doing now , or where I go I tell Yes -- every single time . &quot;
almost . I &apos;m not perfect but I stri@@ ve very much .
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family . &quot;
but it also has an astonishing side effect : only recently I was fully understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; legends have saved my career with my children .
I have a real dream job .
I am a author . I think I am able to aw@@ aken .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ate TV . I live TV .
I have been doing television in large style .
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for letting out 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; every show provides hundreds of jobs , that previously does not exist . &quot;
the budget for an episode of TV can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode of all nine days , four shows , four TV programmes , 70 hours TV , three programs that are simultaneously in production , times four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series are underway on Thursday night .
&quot; all over the world , my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created themselves , and not only produced , so I have to find time , really st@@ ille , creative time to gather my fans around the camp and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who still does it ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I say to you , so that all of you are working so hard to work whether you &apos;re now a company , a country or a class@@ room to take me seriously when I say about work , so that I say , I understand that it is not just about my dream . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all per@@ spiration -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deeper into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a land from nothing .
&quot; it is when I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a dre@@ aming , one gets a high tone , love a marathon . &quot;
one feels like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work it .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and stub@@ born , clin@@ ically and reasonable , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing , is the sum@@ s . &quot;
there is so a change in me when the work goes well .
&quot; a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and grows like a busy street , I could always be on her . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I heard the sum@@ s , that I speak these words that writing me joy . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong . it does .
&quot; but the sum@@ s -- when I started to work with TV production , when I started working and working , build and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing that sum@@ s up this energy . &quot;
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum@@ s , you can not achieve differently than size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling , not to be different , than to stri@@ ve to size , no matter what price . &quot;
that is called the Sum@@ men .
or maybe it means to be a work@@ a@@ ber .
perhaps it &apos;s gen@@ ius too .
perhaps it &apos;s called E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know , that I am not for the failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s . &quot;
&quot; I just want to say to you , I am a titanium , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear : the more successful I will , the more broad@@ casts , the more more over@@ bound limits , the more things happen at the same time , the more things I write , the more I write story , the more expectations it is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country , which I do , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s . &quot;
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I &apos;m the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
&quot; revised , over@@ claimed , exagger@@ ated , burned . &quot;
the sum@@ s stopped .
&quot; now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth , that their mom@@ my is one worker title . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; Bi@@ bs , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot;
these are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s ceased . &quot;
the sum@@ s of the engine was speech@@ less .
I loved my work no more . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same titanium dioxide work , 15 hours @-@ day , working on weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , nothing deleg@@ ating , does not give up , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was an Adv@@ ance @-@ Titan .
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no more fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
&quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work that you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; Heu@@ l you from , uncovered the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know , you are doing , you are doing what you are doing , one loves to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker that knows how to feel the sum@@ s , and know how the sum@@ s stopped , when the sum@@ s stopped , who is it then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I like ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; ask me a question .
&quot; I am on the way back , late and she says , &quot; M@@ um , do you play ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I will say no , I will be aware of two things : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say Yes to everything and secondly , she called me not &quot; Bi@@ bs . &quot; &quot;
she calls no more &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , can you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
nothing special is about it .
&quot; we play and po@@ ke their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of sum@@ s , I can do nothing except match . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country , which I do , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are stick@@ y fingers and hum@@ id k@@ is@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ xing , and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air on this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
the opposite is the opposite of works .
and I &apos;m happy .
something inside me solves .
a mental door goes on and an energi@@ ub comes in .
&quot; not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum@@ s slowly comes back .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble but it is here . &quot;
&quot; not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay on the matter .
it is Love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something we forgot .
&quot; the sum@@ s , the working environment , the titanium , is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I say to you , who I am , if I describe myself through the broad@@ casts and television working hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is . &quot;
the Sum@@ men is no force and it is not working specifically .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the river that comes from the lust of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ awareness and peace .
&quot; the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the print of history , which are to fore@@ see tasks , expect@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps I whis@@ pered to God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it just is love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child will play with me , I will say Yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a permanent rule , so I can deliver myself from any guilt as a work@@ a@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t play a sat@@ in way , so how to work . &quot;
&quot; the truth is painful , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I rather am at home as home .
&quot; this confession is painful , because what a man does rather work to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I am . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; that I am too relaxed , none of them is . &quot;
&quot; we shave in the garden , and back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play Ball .
we burst fl@@ atter@@ ed soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel greater stiff , absent , and confused . &quot;
I am getting ready for my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how one lives , and the sum@@ s of the universe meets me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we stop playing with playing ?
you can also say ! do they always say Yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you hold me for na@@ ive , for a day dream . &quot;
&quot; there you may be right , but you can do it ! &quot;
they have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show piece .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me , until they fall , they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ir@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
&quot; and when my teenage daughter speaks for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more needs it not . &quot;
&quot; every one can put 15 minutes on the piece , even in a bad mood ! &quot;
15 minutes on a piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no di@@ stra@@ ction . &quot;
the day is short : dinner the children &apos;s bed ready .
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my charity , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for its soul peace . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
allow yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out it and keep it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I will fail and I will meet friends , reading books that enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; if you want to play ? &quot; &quot; just for everything I have abandoned , when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in education when I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece why don &apos;t indul@@ ge in 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . the sum@@ s seems to return when I am not working .
work doesn &apos;t work without any games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months opens a door , the energy flow in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , she fills me and my soul . I desp@@ ise my way again . I use it in full trains and love my work again . &quot;
I like the sum@@ s but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s that Sum@@ men is not me ... not anymore .
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and stick@@ y fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
that &apos;s my sum@@ s now .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
&quot; the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
it &apos;s me to s@@ no@@ ve that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who plays back to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play .
and yet I have everything in hand . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the Sum@@ mon . the country I run , the troops , which I run , the troops , the sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum , the sum@@ s of life : the sum@@ s of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am a writer . I think I am able to aw@@ aken .
&quot; that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to play .
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a heavy stroke , or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgery , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity to support self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe injury in the central nervous system , patients often have an lasting , heavy disability . &quot;
this is the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
&quot; a doctor , who tries to improve the nervous functions by various surgical interventions . &quot;
&quot; sure , they have heard of one of the best known classi@@ fications , the &quot; &quot; Deep@@ water @-@ stim@@ ulation . &quot; in this case , you im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep within the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons that improves the neuro@@ logical function . &quot;
it is truly an amazing technology . she has improved the dest@@ iny of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which l@@ acked under hot trem@@ or and severe pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgery is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story started 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and working day and night at the emergency .
I often supplied patients with skul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
&quot; at the skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mat@@ a , you have to imagine that the brain is w@@ asted and the cran@@ ial pressure is growing . &quot;
&quot; to save life , one must decrease the skull pressure . &quot;
sometimes you need to remove a piece of s@@ wollen brain .
&quot; instead of s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze ourselves with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist and brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not a easy task .
&quot; to let cells grow from a tissue , comparable to quite small children who are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; it must find proper food , temperature , moisture , and environments in order to thri@@ ve it . &quot;
exactly that we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean François @-@ François abolished . &quot;
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
this was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; you may know , however , from the bi@@ ographi@@ es that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche . &quot;
it is surprising to maintain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery .
we did another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
&quot; they were gradually divided , and after a few weeks they died . &quot;
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but kept different . &quot;
we needed for a long time to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ b@@ lec@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ um rin@@ d cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; in the stage of the fet@@ us , they take care of the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why are they getting to us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations , close to brain injuries . &quot;
&quot; this is , however , not so sure . &quot;
&quot; one thing is clear , however -- of these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
&quot; in front of a potential cell source , we provide the brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove one piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells as cul@@ tured as it did Jean @-@ François
and they will mark color to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we re@@ im@@ planted them at the near of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transpl@@ antation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re@@ im@@ plant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ im@@ plant the same cells in the brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ ters we were able to work with the monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario , we re@@ im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were taken away after some weeks when they were taken away again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , so they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we added an injury to and re@@ im@@ planted the same cells , and now they remained the cells -- it grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
&quot; the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells , which we dy@@ ed in vitro , in the culture . &quot;
we could not stop this here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill problem .
they had to take feeding pellets from one tablet .
they made it very well .
&quot; when they achieved a stable skill level , in the motor Cort@@ ex , we had the motor @-@ motor in Cort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they re@@ covering spont@@ aneously to a certain degree , just like a stroke . &quot;
patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with plastic brain mechanisms . they rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate to a certain degree as the monkeys .
&quot; as we sure , the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left , you see the monkeys that recovered spont@@ aneously . &quot;
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we re@@ im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the m@@ am@@ pl@@ antation . &quot;
I can tell you that we were very exciting for us .
&quot; since that time , we found much more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and later use .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ press them in people .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives the means to cure itself . &quot;
thank you so much .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , which is wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can take this . &quot;
I definitely falls .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials involving human subjects . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the main obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ ate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look at the future -- you have finished research and tried to get the permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look in the future , how many years it takes to come to hospital and will be available for this therapy . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
initially it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to choose the patient , to carry out treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
afterwards it is necessary to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
&quot; first , you need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
&quot; in the West , we make a big mistake , of course , of course . &quot;
&quot; we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant , which is in reality , but as the inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at them as un@@ changeable ti@@ bility .
we believe capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its large im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have clearly proved that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while the policy remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was declared in@@ comprehen@@ sible to me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - do not affect the austerity policies , which were implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ he@@ v or the Communist Party of China , or some of my essay friends who would have repeatedly said that democracy would change anything if anything would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economical model for true democracy . &quot;
&quot; I beg you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; because without democracy , our societies are w@@ asted , our future is dark and our great new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contra@@ diction that threat@@ ens our ta@@ vern@@ s . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin on Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognise him as the cancellation of the debt , who throws his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt , &quot;
but few recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is to be anxi@@ ous to invest , however , to invest where it might be productive and income in which one could produce productive and income in which humanity could be urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , US dollars were invested in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial facilities , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment and so on . &quot;
&quot; a total of 3.4 trillion dollars will be compared to much money until one compar@@ es it to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to move , except the ex@@ changes and real estate prices . &quot;
so debt and un@@ productive capital make the twin @-@ peak peaks of the usual market mechanisms involved .
&quot; the result are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and therefore a low demand for the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ ing the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors could be true that his son would kill him if he is growing , &quot;
&quot; un@@ intenti@@ onally , the circumstances ar@@ gues that the edi@@ pus kills him . &quot;
that is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely tigh@@ tened art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
I believe . but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the company &apos;s form in which the Free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally closed too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of ath@@ en@@ ical democracy because of these out@@ casts . &quot;
&quot; the decision @-@ ending at the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , and is that she gave the working poor and not only the right to free expression of expression , but rather important and crucial , which they admitted to them the right to political participation in questions of state treasury . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not held a long time --
&quot; like a candle that sh@@ ines very bright , it is burned quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a stat@@ ute for ruling . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was bor@@ dered by politics , while the economy -- hence the world of corporations -- a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time , where these separation from politics and economy began , an in@@ ex@@ orable battle between the two , in which the economy wander@@ ed gradually into politics . &quot;
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians are not as much as before ?
it is not in a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is estimated that you can be in the government nowadays and nevertheless , not at power , because the power from politics is emigrated to the economy and the areas are separate . &quot;
I mentioned my shar@@ ks with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of rob@@ ber@@ y that is so sustainable the animals , of which it is nourished , dec@@ im@@ ated by the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that the policy has so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized , that it grows through the self @-@ induced economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations growing , political goods are increasing , the economic demand is falling and the managing director of the companies are to be anxi@@ ous to invest cash of their enterprises . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism makes the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the benefit of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we have to put together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keeps control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea just 100 years ago and it was not particularly good .
&quot; the teachings given from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor could recover only by a miracle , as in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : preventing the working arms !
&quot; capitalism does it , by making low glo@@ omy employees by automation and robots . &quot;
&quot; the problem is , so long economy and policies are separate areas , the autom@@ ating the twin summit will be higher , the waste of waste , and social conflicts are deeper , as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries such as China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to join the economy and re@@ unite the economy and politics , and hereby we consider the re@@ unified area , otherwise we will show the re@@ unified area of monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ iti@@ acy that lets the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism has the technological achievements , which he has brought forth , will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that of &quot; Matrix , &quot; in which machines are serving the people and put their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks the sense of life . &quot;
&quot; I think , we may be optimi@@ stic . &quot;
&quot; so what does it mean , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to call you in all very soon , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the company &apos;s field : ask a capital market prior to you , while you are working and in which your capital will follow you from a work@@ station to next , and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all income from capital and income come entirely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , but no num@@ bs between capital and labor , no large g@@ aps between investment and economic , and ultimately no emp@@ or@@ atory twins summit . &quot;
&quot; in the area of global political economy : just imagine that our national currencies have set a free exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade in this currency is tra@@ ded -- call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the surplus of the country in a common fund . &quot;
&quot; also , imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investments are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at the time it wasn &apos;t the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially in front of the background of a unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world , which I describe you , is simultaneously more liber@@ alized in which they preferred privileged people , and Marx@@ ist because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a true democracy . &quot;
will we wake up in such a world
or will we fall into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we choose politically .
it is in our hands and we are better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you write yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ist in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I &apos;ve just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... do we do that , the technological development create a massive decline in all economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis of a part of Earth to the next one , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in more liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; Marx is quite relevant if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant &quot;
&quot; just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , this is why I am a liber@@ t@@ ful Marx@@ ist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely in@@ vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ e . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are well . &quot;
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t think you don &apos;t think enough .
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical declaration -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said . BG : in your lecture mentioned you Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have told what you will keep from the view of the West to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a huge measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal democracy , we have the note of democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy on politics , during the area where most of the business plays , -- the area of the economy -- a completely democr@@ atically @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain way , if I may say pro@@ voc@@ ative it , China resem@@ bles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; -- Do you remember ? we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error , historical . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill &quot;
it was particularly sk@@ ep@@ tical what the democratic development concerns .
&quot; what to observe in China is similar to the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to do China now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of the hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as financial minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to say goodbye to the sel@@ fis@@ hness , and to den@@ ial that a massive fault line through the euro@@ zone was , and continues to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggest@@ ion that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; right to make it right . unfortunately , the powers have chosen within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continue to den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not capable of getting life through political will and auth@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , you might have to leave a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and de@@ structive . &quot;
BG : which transformation do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone won &apos;t have a future if we do not change its creation .
BG : did you have any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously aft ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister who is in office after 6 months in office , especially in a so @-@ called situation that he did not have any mistakes , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the largest error was to pro@@ claim the application for the extension of the debt programme in late February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the staff to find a common solution .
but that was not the case .
&quot; they only wanted to bring about our government , just because they did not want to deal with the public@@ ans that ran through the Eurozone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they have been a cat@@ astro@@ phic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the Tro@@ ika &apos;s Tro@@ ika has imposed this policy , stressed : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive aun@@ dice of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone was somebody who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the im@@ mobili@@ zed air forces will be ro@@ mon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
that will not have dis@@ astro@@ us consequences for Europe alone but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we would allow ourselves to take a post@@ modern 1930 &apos;s way , what it appears to me , it will also be well served for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong with this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for having been at T@@ ED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; Roy Price has never heard the most , although it probably is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
probably for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision to hit the Roy three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has an ion@@ er and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; film , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for making shows and content the content of the Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought sector . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
&quot; he must find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he needs to find shows that are located very right at this bend . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows that review will receive . &quot;
your show is valued at nine and higher is this a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows such as &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted , where , after one saw a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this type of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not hold on the left side of the curve , because I don &apos;t need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes himself more thoughts about the middle declaration , average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire them . &quot;
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something so that &apos;s why Roy Price does not want to risk . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he stops a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online , where you can watch out for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon is in vain for free things , do you feel right ? &quot;
millions of spectators watching this episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are watched during watching this shows . &quot;
they are being watched by Roy and his team who receive everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you check out , which parts are ski@@ pped and check again . &quot;
&quot; you collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show they should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com for four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; alpha House , &quot; &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show , because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is just an average show -- on the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 -- so something above the average , but not just what Roy and his team worked out . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , another company has pl@@ az@@ ed a top @-@ show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming design of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy it &apos;s always on the search to find this a Super @-@ show and he also uses data for it , but it does something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the spectators : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had gathered all the parts , they went and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators but a drama series about a Senator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 review on this curve . so , exactly where they wanted . &quot;
of course the question is : what happened here ?
&quot; one has two very competent , experienced data . &quot;
&quot; they combine these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
why is this ?
&quot; because the logic states somehow , that all should work with everything . &quot;
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision which you will meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as Back @-@ Up .
optimized through a very powerful computer .
&quot; what you can expect is good TV , right ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis is not working so , this is something frigh@@ tening , because we live in a time we want to make more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the company &apos;s multi @-@ health system ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if anyone is in prison in the US and in order to be dis@@ appo@@ inting , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ agreement is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , it will be decided whether a person is good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results . this doesn &apos;t matter that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data is also in@@ correct .
&quot; yes , even Google makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it is possible to anticip@@ ate data analysis of flu , lim@@ it@@ ous ways - by data analysis of Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news location . the success gi@@ fted in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked just fine , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it was simply not working , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data are experienced as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all of this error , data will look into decisions of life - at work , in law en@@ forcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather ensure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gen@@ etics -- a field where some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . I recognized some samples by the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated .
&quot; do you ever have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; as a result , put this problem into its components , so you can analyse the components ; as second , put the single parts together to put a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : get apart and setup . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
&quot; they are not suitable to assemble the parts , and then to come to a decision . &quot;
there is another tool and we all have : our brain .
&quot; if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces once more complete , even if the information is incomplete , especially when the brain is an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think it was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to understand their audience better , what else they would have been capable of . but the decision , how to make all these parts , come back again and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that does not stand up in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show what meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV ideas , then they chose an &quot; alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they always could say : &quot; we tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better choices , but I think things are wrong when data start ste@@ er our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order to forget that this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question you will only shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
&quot; I will leave it later , with a technique of technique . &quot;
&quot; so far , I met some decisions in my life , whereby I would have listened to the ball in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic building .
&quot; so perhaps the ball becomes wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is in us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that in spite of the great amount of data still paying off , decisions to be met , an expert in what you do , and risks to go . &quot;
&quot; by the end , it is not the data , but the risks to land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you beautiful .
