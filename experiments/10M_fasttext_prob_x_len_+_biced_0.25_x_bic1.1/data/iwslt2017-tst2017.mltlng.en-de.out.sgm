<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize in New York-Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard about Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which it was spectacular that the NSA have illegally heard illegal phones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"therein, he describes a disastrous U.S. secret service operation in which the CIA had literally broken designs for nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But you know who didn't like this chapter right?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government against Risen was determined and urged him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this train, he became the symbol of the pattern of the government, Whistleblower and to prosecuting journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutions, the media have the right to publish the secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media is not able to protect these information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the muters, they are reasonably priced."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so, when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many courageous journalists did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen was thus living with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something unusual happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though, for years, it would be essential for their fall, the government's demands were dropped by Risen."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: during the period of electronic monitoring the reporter and sources can hide themselves less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failure and rubbers to make statements, this may also do its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his permission, is concerned with his phone,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like its e-mail data, financial and banana information, its credit card, and even travel tips with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risens."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, it is just one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised with his lawyer to protect Whistleblower. but instead the judiciary has more condemns than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government supports much of their work as home."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since 11 September, almost every article about national security was the result that a whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, we place the press coverage of the game that will be protected by the first Constitutional Treaty, because the government has more possibilities to construct all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the technology of the government allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"indeed, they can record from the moment in which they contact, instead of inside, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that had not been written when Risen had written his book, and it is considerably more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transmission system for Whistleblower that was originally developed by Aaron Swartz, which was originally developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post here."</seg>
<seg id="33">"you can also upload documents or send documents, as in any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, which only has access to the news agency access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so, the government cannot find out more information secretly, and many of the information that would request it would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spy technologies that are all dangerous to us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it's ensuring that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to make abuse. it's just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who wants to report about abuse of soldiers who wants to report a humble and overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm for the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies have not only been made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the largest data network of history was published.] [the" Panama Papers "reveal that Reiche and Mighty] [We asked Robert Palmer by Global Witness to have a statement.] this week we were asked by news about a Leck of 11 million documents in Panama's local law firm Fonseca."</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we will get an impression of it, such as customers, banks and lawyers as a musk Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you do that? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already lead to the very first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has stepped down.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bsachal-Assad Offers in tax havens has."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars on Russia's President Vladimir Putin will take a close friend of child days, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of more rich people and others, which are nervous to wait for the next publication, and to the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of a agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems, cries away from you, to me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we apply this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not all taxes to pay, then this means lower money for important public services such as health care, education, streets."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"media and leading politicians are discussing media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens of some few are used to hide and concede their wealth -- something we have been discussing and unveil for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people will seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one company has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult to understand law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that in the US there are less reports about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there were no prominent Americans, who came to this scandal in these revelations."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, through the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data center of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states to set up a company to establish a company as a library document."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparent in the USA has allowed the employees of school districts.</seg>
<seg id="69">"it has permitted betting, especially vulnerable incers."</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to figure out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent investigative investigators in the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators gave himself as an African minister, who wanted to bring the suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht to buy a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked us, that all through to a lawyer from our investigator could make suggestions, how he could transferring his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"all these were prejudicate. no one of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course, no one was handed over to this system. but it shows the problem with that system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single attorney that spreads proposals for our missing investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it does not go about a single top, wound up in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works closely with corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"all this may sound very comforting, as if we could do nothing about it; as if nothing is ever changed; as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but, as a geborg optimist, I certainly see that some has begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the past couple of years, we have seen many transparency to greater transparency, affecting the owners of firms."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland."</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then the EU has been recorded in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US could go back here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have adopted a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama disclosures, this vast insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and global for more transparency."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are mad when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in the economy that arise and say: "Indo is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and to finish it through the laws of intransparent.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finally finish this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was abducted almost once and in the boot of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I had completed my design studies, I made a backyard."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my masterpieces.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made a road trip through the whole country. thereafter he would go to the Peace scorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing even worse," "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleep place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him only! he says that he would go to the Peace of Peace, but I don't know whether he is really planning. I don't want to land in the boot of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I heard me say," I have a air matratze. you can sleep in my living room. ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head, said:" uh, how please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night, I was in bed, I stared to the ceiling, and thought," Oh, man! ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild boar sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such fear that I got out of the bed, at Zehentops to the door, and my sleep door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the work of art, which he purchased from me, depends on his classroom. he is now teachers."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my view angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as foreigners, actually friends who were waiting for waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accommodate people on my air matripen, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air matratze."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let us make a jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost plexed, my roommates and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were booked out.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think, creativity can create, fear in fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment will stay with a designer Bed and and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, WiFi and a desk inclusive, with a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded "air matratze and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at wooden floors for 20 dollars on wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure, our cheese ham Omelettes were completely different because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we were talking to our last guest, and the door to the castle came, reverting Brian and I joined us."</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommates, Nate Blead czyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"so we presented the investors:" we want to create a web site, on the people public images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind room, whose doors are close when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"via the Internet, they can then invite foreign foreign people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she did not put them.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allowed strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learned as children that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if one has a problem, one can rely on the things you can do. we were designed to design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just look and haptic -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create trust in design, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a taste sample, what degree of confidence we consented."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">"now, I like to advise you to unlock your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent impulse from panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what you feel when you open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">"the only thing, when your mobile phone is your mobile phone, is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they watch your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most guests feel better if they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that who has actually got Al Gores mobile now?</seg>
<seg id="165">"could you be aware of Twitter, that he would support the Presidency of the President?"</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phone now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor should have shown at once with his name; if he had told how he comes his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine, you would have 150 assessments, who all say:" he can really hold on cell phones very well! "</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you would have to hand your cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-done feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we got some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given her assessment before being ordered online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how they are similar to age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most that are similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less confidence we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add to a person's call -- in our case due to assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three denominations, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changing everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation for similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the correct design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we knew that trust is dependent on how much you are reasonably priced."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if one tells you, how" Hi!, "you do not get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"we are talking too much, like for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is not accepted either."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so, there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." Tolle's artworks in your apartment! I do with my family vacation. ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also provide tips on which topics you should write.</seg>
<seg id="193">"our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help, to overcome our prejudices against strangers."</seg>
<seg id="194">"with what we didn't reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than ready to dismantle those prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">"here, see how many people take our offer."</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been bred before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated unallowed parties or devastated homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Guests have to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts if I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"disappointment, which you hear in the voice of the Angolfer, was and will always be our biggest motivation to improve on us."</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily of the 123 million nights only a fraction had ever been a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trusted one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, wonders may arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests did vacation in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood on the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers, who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and furnished with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel that save lives, even though they do not know at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you are driving a hospital in your own car, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want to feel embarrassing, they bring together books."</seg>
<seg id="220">"they can even stay longer, without charging the extra-night."</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"so, of course, not every stay."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"for the first time I stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of part work together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's all about an economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now simply to call the" "lease industry", "the thing will not be justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of themselves open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, this is to be compared with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what would happen if traveling a rich buffet of local income?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be, if at any place, which one visited, a group there would wait for a thorough to fill a thorough and one of a bar-winding neighborhood, of which one has never heard;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to make homes of reason to be shared?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be to accept the minds of the common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine the cities that make us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and depreciation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"this project has already started in South Korea in Seoul. a lot of parking spaces that belonged to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"now the residents were offered. students who were looking for a stay, were offered,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"they were conveyed in people whose children were out. they were incubators,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy, via our platform, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be host to a foreigner or even hosts."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">"even before it was hospitality, too."</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just made our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the correct design with the issues of confidence."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome profound prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I think that amazingly,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it when a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design can not solve every problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brain launderwear, a terror?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security door at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"so, the media represent the media that look like me."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study showed that 80% of reporting about Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"to all those who have never met a Muslims, it is great to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- doubly espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">A sedant-like-fanatician, "</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to choose.</seg>
<seg id="275">I was 17 when I was 17 when I was 17.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lustige was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, with the pressure that I felt as a 17-year-old, I felt a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, reasoned in question, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion who deepened himself with each reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"ever had you ever feel that someone has perceiving you completely, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later, I married and began like all the good Egyptians, my career as engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later I had, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the" Egyptian-American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then the terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"in my kitchen I was sitting in my kitchen, looked at the end. looked at the screen and saw the word" Breaking News. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people spread out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the TV channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists "...,"... "in the name of Islam...,..."... "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"not only my country was attacked, but in the Nu changed the works of others from a civil war in a suspicious."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to travel through the Middle East from the United States to start a new town and begin studying the postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as we drove me -- as we got silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time to be recognized as Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved in this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and when I heard, I read and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" be vigilant, "" Be careful, "" Abide in well lit areas, "" Be not deceived. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then it was Friday in that week -- the day, where Muslims will gather to the prayer."</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings," "Is not this first Friday, the mosque could be a destination."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were undisturbed, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were for Muslims, were crushed and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There really was fire suggestions on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt wasn't felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because the people who attacked this country, have attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I got the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say people: "there is a problem in that country -- it's called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and include mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as from a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It just raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is known as a whole and a benign tumor is only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all the Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, educators and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Moscheen America be safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"maybe there will be a few parking lots, but not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit to a mosque leads to regard people other faith, tolerant, and greater civil participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a director of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalized in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in the bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"the radicalization process has found that it begins online. as a result, the person is cut off from their congregation, even from their family so that the extremiist can make a brain wash, and everyone who abhorred the terrorists are real Muslims, and everyone who abhorred their behaviour and ideology."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we need to stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to us in their imagination when you recognize it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan to Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology according to their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you throw a look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">A great Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she would have been invited to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy concerning whom she spoke, she brought to silence and told her that her anger, her mind for injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had been given to their anger, she was a major goal for the Instrumentalisation by extremists who promised to a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam set the connection to God and to their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accuse for their anger, he showed constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"she learned what she learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight as the Islamophobia me and my family concerns me.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does normal Americans work out?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">"a study -- actually several neuroscience studies -- demonstrate: if we fear ourselves, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"rather, we accept a authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: when one assumes test individuals, in which negative about Muslims was reported that they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as to the circumcision of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">That is not only an acute problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look, when the mood against Muslims pushed forward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of Iraq war and during two voting periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"in fact, there can be a tool for manipulation of the public to evappoint the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear harm us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the assignment of collective responsibility, it is not only about to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the most sweet, most generous person who knew her."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when has been such a sealed young man from my stock?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had posted in the afternoon, after he had posted an statements against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times at Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or abode at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision, because it was about what America would want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear or one, in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat we drove silence to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, and pulled out my shoes, went into the building hall, and what I saw, left me."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was filled out.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the meeting were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and not believers who had come to attack us, but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"in this moment, I am broken together."</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go down to number sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those that mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Wters: so Dalia - you seem to have a nerv hit.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyist started to become a billionaire.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is made possible in research facilities worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before the air-package into our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of flight machines in the FracCentre in France has built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks in France. some years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting devices, flight sets high speed and acceleration to the top space."</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-bearing structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads of turbulences and react with turbulences and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possibility of an autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"to make a system autonomous, it must be known collectively know where there are mobile objects in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"every flying machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level, e.g." start "and" land. ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter.</seg>
<seg id="422">"a flight device, which tries to beat two flies with one flap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in the downward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most strong flexes, it can hover, and thus it has great advantages with start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a sweeping side."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limbs of tailor is that they react sensitivous to turbulences as wind cores.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">"the idea behind it is that the air device doesn't matter in what position is the optimum position, and improve the performance by practicing."</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask the fundamental abstract questions that penetrate to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to answer the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are roughly known as machines with a thousand mobile parts, that joined together to violate you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"before decades, trained pilots could fly remotely controlled flying devices that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a rear rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest control unit. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"only one moving part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no valves, hinges and cross rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, just a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"even though it's mechanically simple, it happens in the inner life very much, so that it can fly stable and can move in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tavern. to make it to fly, I have to throw it exactly right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood, to throw it right, is minimal, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is a practice in pleasurities, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the utmost ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"in the room to move in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned or even like it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly to flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate twin propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build it together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, electronics or a battery - can fly the machine if restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by doing half of airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic sheer.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">"we acquired standard micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit them with localization technology and algorithms."</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">"hopefully, these demonstrations contribute to rethinking about new revolutionary ideas."</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially secure machine da drens would like to be a flying lamp screen on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">"for types, like us, the salary is in the development and the train act."</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart gifts to form them in a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">"the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, the bag is on the i."</seg>

<seg id="471">It was a very big pop.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they set up their power but not in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given in the space-time feelings and the universe exploded gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">"then, we arrange the events in time."</seg>
<seg id="476">"more than 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell lives were born on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has produced some more: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stand at -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"some 25 years ago, a group of particularly brave -- Rai Weiss by MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Dreger from Caltech -- are looking for a huge laser detector to look for gravitational black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as crazy genies so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the Detector Ligo: the laser-interferometric Gravitational Observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"during the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo was significantly enhanced, which improved the detection capacity enormously."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore you called him Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify several smaller, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitation waves of the two collidized black holes through the earth through."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector itself.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than these:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my daughter's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, these were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for what I worked is not longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been examines gravitational waves of black holes and their observatory like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves? "</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crusal in the emotions of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when crossing the shaft, the space and its overall content are stretched in a direction and into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrative studies, lecturers in courses at relativity theory often lead a correct albery dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusty, stretching and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us yearns and gested at the meeting of the waves. the reminder of an average people was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means that 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the Ligo staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length must be measured on less than a thousand of the radius of a nuclear-nucleus. that's grotesk."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne described a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves in the following way:" the technical difficulties when construction of such detectors are tremendous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicist are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles are overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims that Ligo is more than an ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this signifies.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite convenient, because you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points."</seg>
<seg id="509">"with killing, that is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore, it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that make you very much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child is about.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties such as pitch, pitch, rhythm, and volume, to close the history behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, Alice's talking about."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"grief Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">Same goes for gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make a simple pictures of objects in all of them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"however, in terms of changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least there are measured frequencies in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave pattern to sound, we can hear the all literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravitation to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott worked very long."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circulate simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two body very quickly, one hears the same circle with an additional clay-change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu."</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement, shaped into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard Ligo heard the following: [Surrender of sound] Jno one knows what he needs to hear this as a sound from -- SH:... two black holes, each rotate as quickly as the sticks of your Mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: if we consider ourselves what this signifies.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 Suns, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we have heard.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to all sounds and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">"much in all, we can't see -- practically or basically -- not."</seg>
<seg id="536">Supernova, for example. I would like to know why massaging stars in Supernovae explode. "</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about them all.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon hides."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through that these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it would explore transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the Urballe is covered by its own posture."</seg>
<seg id="541">"through gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen, that we will never see, and of which we have no idea that we can only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found the first point of things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague on MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars that produce black holes, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. so, the black holes are the vacuum bone of our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo allows us to view a completely different perspective on the events of the universe, based on the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">"AA: the challenge is now, as courageous as it is possible."</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listens to the rustles and circles of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatories -- a brand new generation of Observatories on Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>

<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Would I start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, no, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"a crazy thing happened: that exactly what I was afraid, when I was afraid, my fear was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, speeches, my social fear -- puff, gone."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life has changed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," me. "</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yeah that changed my life to unexpectedly. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for unexplained reasons all" kitties, "</seg>
<seg id="570">As she would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"Bibs, I need milk for my remuneration."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me once, whether I could play with her, when I was straight on the jump. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new life setting in my family. from there, I swear to always play with them as soon as you look for me. no matter what I'm doing now, or where I go I tell Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect but I strive very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an astonishing side effect: only recently I was fully understood that the "Yes" legends have saved my career with my children.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a author. I think I am able to awaken.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Create TV. I live TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I have been doing television in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for letting out 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">"every show provides hundreds of jobs, that previously does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of TV can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode of all nine days, four shows, four TV programmes, 70 hours TV, three programs that are simultaneously in production, times four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: the Catch, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are underway on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created themselves, and not only produced, so I have to find time, really stille, creative time to gather my fans around the camp and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say to you, so that all of you are working so hard to work whether you're now a company, a country or a classroom to take me seriously when I say about work, so that I say, I understand that it is not just about my dream."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all perspiration -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deeper into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is when I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a dreaming, one gets a high tone, love a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work it.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and stubborn, clinically and reasonable, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing, is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a sums starts in my head, and it grows and grows like a busy street, I could always be on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I heard the sums, that I speak these words that writing me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong. it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I started to work with TV production, when I started working and working, build and collaborate, I discovered this thing that sums up this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sums, you can not achieve differently than size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling, not to be different, than to strive to size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">That is called the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means to be a workaber.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's genius too.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know, that I am not for the failure, and I only know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to say to you, I am a titanium, and I know I don't want to ask."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make it clear: the more successful I will, the more broadcasts, the more more overbound limits, the more things happen at the same time, the more things I write, the more I write story, the more expectations it is."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country, which I do, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I'm the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overclaimed, exaggerated, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that their mommy is one worker title."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says," Bibs, I want to go to Shonda-Land. ""</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work no more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same titanium dioxide work, 15 hours-day, working on weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, nothing delegating, does not give up, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was an Advance-Titan.</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no more fun."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do when what you do, the work that you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" Heul you from, uncovered the author-Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know, you are doing, you are doing what you are doing, one loves to be a teacher, a banker that knows how to feel the sums, and know how the sums stopped, when the sums stopped, who is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I like?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" ask me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way back, late and she says," Mum, do you play? ""</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I will say no, I will be aware of two things:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say Yes to everything and secondly, she called me not" Bibs. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan and my sums, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mama, can you play?" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">Nothing special is about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and poke their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book" Everybody Poops "." "</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and lack of sums, I can do nothing except match."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, which I do, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, waxing, and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air on this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">The opposite is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I'm happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energiub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums slowly comes back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, barely there, it's quiet, hardly audible but it is here."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sums."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay on the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is Love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working environment, the titanium, is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I say to you, who I am, if I describe myself through the broadcasts and television working hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The Summen is no force and it is not working specifically.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums ignores the print of history, which are to foresee tasks, expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps I whispered to God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It just is love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child will play with me, I will say Yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a permanent rule, so I can deliver myself from any guilt as a workaber."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"don't play a satin way, so how to work."</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth is painful,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I rather am at home as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this confession is painful, because what a man does rather work to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I am."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">"that I am too relaxed, none of them is."</seg>
<seg id="731">"we shave in the garden, and back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst flattered soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel greater stiff, absent, and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I am getting ready for my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how one lives, and the sums of the universe meets me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we stop playing with playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say! do they always say Yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you hold me for naive, for a day dream."</seg>
<seg id="742">"there you may be right, but you can do it!"</seg>
<seg id="743">They have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show piece.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me, until they fall, they want to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkirfer or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and when my teenage daughter speaks for 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more needs it not."</seg>
<seg id="752">"every one can put 15 minutes on the piece, even in a bad mood!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner the children's bed ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my charity, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is to feel the sums to have a place for its soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,"</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Allow yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I will fail and I will meet friends, reading books that enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"if you want to play?" "just for everything I have abandoned, when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in education when I wanted to surpass more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece why don't indulge in 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return when I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work doesn't work without any games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months opens a door, the energy flow in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, she fills me and my soul. I despise my way again. I use it in full trains and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums that Summen is not me... not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">That's my sums now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">It's me to snove that I am a Titan. I've never seen a Titan who plays back to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in hand. my brain is still working. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel like a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the Summon. the country I run, the troops, which I run, the troops, the sound, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sum, the sums of life: the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sums, the more this unusual, beating, naked and new life feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a writer. I think I am able to awaken.</seg>
<seg id="789">"that belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to play.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a heavy stroke, or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgery, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity to support self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe injury in the central nervous system, patients often have an lasting, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is the reason why I was functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">"a doctor, who tries to improve the nervous functions by various surgical interventions."</seg>
<seg id="804">"sure, they have heard of one of the best known classifications, the" "Deepwater-stimulation." in this case, you implanted a electrode deep within the brain to influence the circuits of neurons that improves the neurological function. "</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. she has improved the destiny of patients with Parkinson's disease which lacked under hot tremor and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgery is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and working day and night at the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skulls-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"at the skull-Hirn-Traumata, you have to imagine that the brain is wasted and the cranial pressure is growing."</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, one must decrease the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you need to remove a piece of swollen brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze ourselves with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist and brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not a easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to let cells grow from a tissue, comparable to quite small children who are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"it must find proper food, temperature, moisture, and environments in order to thrive it."</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean François-François abolished."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"you may know, however, from the biographies that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to maintain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">"they were gradually divided, and after a few weeks they died."</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but kept different."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed for a long time to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebellum rind cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"in the stage of the fetus, they take care of the folding of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they getting to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations, close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">"this is, however, not so sure."</seg>
<seg id="848">"one thing is clear, however -- of these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">"in front of a potential cell source, we provide the brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove one piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells as cultured as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they will mark color to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we reimplanted them at the near of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reimplant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplant the same cells in the brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Routers we were able to work with the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were taken away after some weeks when they were taken away again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, so they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we added an injury to and reimplanted the same cells, and now they remained the cells -- it grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells, which we dyed in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop this here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill problem.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feeding pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they achieved a stable skill level, in the motor Cortex, we had the motor-motor in Cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in humans, they recovering spontaneously to a certain degree, just like a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with plastic brain mechanisms. they recuperate to a certain degree as the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">"as we sure, the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left, you see the monkeys that recovered spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the mamplantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we found much more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to impress them in people.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives the means to cure itself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, which is wonderful, I'm sure now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can take this. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely falls.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials involving human subjects."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the main obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delikate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look at the future -- you have finished research and tried to get the permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look in the future, how many years it takes to come to hospital and will be available for this therapy."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Initially it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">You have to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to choose the patient, to carry out treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">Afterwards it is necessary to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, you need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone."</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">"in the West, we make a big mistake, of course, of course."</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant, which is in reality, but as the inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchangeable tibility.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its large imitators in Beijing have clearly proved that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while the policy remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy comes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was declared incomprehensible to me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - do not affect the austerity policies, which were implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yhev or the Communist Party of China, or some of my essay friends who would have repeatedly said that democracy would change anything if anything would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economical model for true democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I beg you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"because without democracy, our societies are wasted, our future is dark and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that threatens our taverns."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin on Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognise him as the cancellation of the debt, who throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which is to be anxious to invest, however, to invest where it might be productive and income in which one could produce productive and income in which humanity could be urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, US dollars were invested in the United States, in England and in the Eurozone, in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial facilities, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"a total of 3.4 trillion dollars will be compared to much money until one compares it to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to move, except the exchanges and real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">So debt and unproductive capital make the twin-peak peaks of the usual market mechanisms involved.</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and therefore a low demand for the pessimising the pessimism of investors could be true that his son would kill him if he is growing,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"unintentionally, the circumstances argues that the edipus kills him."</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely tightened art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and to finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe. but before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the company's form in which the Free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of athenical democracy because of these outcasts."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision-ending at the Athenian democracy, and is that she gave the working poor and not only the right to free expression of expression, but rather important and crucial, which they admitted to them the right to political participation in questions of state treasury."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not held a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that shines very bright, it is burned quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our current liberal democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was bordered by politics, while the economy -- hence the world of corporations -- a democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our current democracies, since the time, where these separation from politics and economy began, an inexorable battle between the two, in which the economy wandered gradually into politics."</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are not as much as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is estimated that you can be in the government nowadays and nevertheless, not at power, because the power from politics is emigrated to the economy and the areas are separate."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it's like a herd of robbery that is so sustainable the animals, of which it is nourished, decimated by the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that the policy has so far cannibalized, that it grows through the self-induced economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations growing, political goods are increasing, the economic demand is falling and the managing director of the companies are to be anxious to invest cash of their enterprises."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism makes the" demos "[the people] from democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the benefit of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that's true, it is obvious that we have to put together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" demos "keeps control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea just 100 years ago and it was not particularly good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the teachings given from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor could recover only by a miracle, as in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: preventing the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">"capitalism does it, by making low gloomy employees by automation and robots."</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, so long economy and policies are separate areas, the automating the twin summit will be higher, the waste of waste, and social conflicts are deeper, as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries such as China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to join the economy and reunite the economy and politics, and hereby we consider the reunified area, otherwise we will show the reunified area of monitoring hyperautocritiacy that lets the film" Matrix "appear as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism has the technological achievements, which he has brought forth, will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that of" Matrix, "in which machines are serving the people and put their energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian" Agora, "in long talks the sense of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">"I think, we may be optimistic."</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what does it mean, how could it look like this" Star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" matrix "similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to call you in all very soon, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the company's field: ask a capital market prior to you, while you are working and in which your capital will follow you from a workstation to next, and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then, all income from capital and income come entirely overhauled and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, but no numbs between capital and labor, no large gaps between investment and economic, and ultimately no emporatory twins summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the area of global political economy: just imagine that our national currencies have set a free exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries]."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade in this currency is traded -- call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Kosmos "" -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the surplus of the country in a common fund. "</seg>
<seg id="967">"also, imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investments are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at the time it wasn't the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially in front of the background of a unified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world, which I describe you, is simultaneously more liberalized in which they preferred privileged people, and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and keynesian, global keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine a true democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we fall into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we choose politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we are better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You write yourself as a libertarian Marxist in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I've just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for reunification of politics and the economy is... do we do that, the technological development create a massive decline in all economic demand, which Larry Summers describes as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis of a part of Earth to the next one, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in more liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"Marx is quite relevant if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just like Hayek, this is why I am a libertful Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am completely invertebrae."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: indeed, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't think you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical declaration -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said. BG: in your lecture mentioned you Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have told what you will keep from the view of the West to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a huge measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"in our liberal democracy, we have the note of democracy."</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my talk, we have limited democracy on politics, during the area where most of the business plays, -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratically-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain way, if I may say provocative it, China resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"-- Do you remember? we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that is an error, historical."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill"</seg>
<seg id="997">It was particularly skeptical what the democratic development concerns.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what to observe in China is similar to the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to do China now, to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of the hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as financial minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to say goodbye to the selfishness, and to denial that a massive fault line through the eurozone was, and continues to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"right to make it right. unfortunately, the powers have chosen within the eurozone, within the European group, continue to denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system that is not capable of getting life through political will and authitarianism, you might have to leave a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: which transformation do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone won't have a future if we do not change its creation.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously aft...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any minister who is in office after 6 months in office, especially in a so-called situation that he did not have any mistakes, then it is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The largest error was to proclaim the application for the extension of the debt programme in late February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the staff to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not the case.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they only wanted to bring about our government, just because they did not want to deal with the publicans that ran through the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the Troika's Troika has imposed this policy, stressed:" that was a colossaler mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive aundice of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone was somebody who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they do not survive, the immobilized air forces will be romonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">That will not have disastrous consequences for Europe alone but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we would allow ourselves to take a postmodern 1930's way, what it appears to me, it will also be well served for the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you're wrong with this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you for having been at TED."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"Roy Price has never heard the most, although it probably is responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision to hit the Roy three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slender, has an ioner and describes himself on Twitter as" film, TV, technique, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for making shows and content the content of the Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought sector."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he needs to find shows that are located very right at this bend."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows that review will receive."</seg>
<seg id="1050">Your show is valued at nine and higher is this a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows such as" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addicted, where, after one saw a season, your brain asks:" where is there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not hold on the left side of the curve, because I don't need special intelligence to offer" Toddlers and tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes himself more thoughts about the middle declaration, average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire them."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something so that's why Roy Price does not want to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he stops a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online, where you can watch out for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon is in vain for free things, do you feel right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watching this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are watched during watching this shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are being watched by Roy and his team who receive everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you check out, which parts are skipped and check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"you collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show they should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom for four republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"alpha House," "but it seems that not many can remember this show, because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is just an average show -- on the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 -- so something above the average, but not just what Roy and his team worked out."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time, another company has plazed a top-show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming design of Netflix. exactly like Roy it's always on the search to find this a Super-show and he also uses data for it, but it does something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use these data to find out these little details about the spectators: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had gathered all the parts, they went and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators but a drama series about a Senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this curve. so, exactly where they wanted. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competent, experienced data."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they combine these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">"because the logic states somehow, that all should work with everything."</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision which you will meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Optimized through a very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good TV, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis is not working so, this is something frightening, because we live in a time we want to make more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company's multi-health system?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if anyone is in prison in the US and in order to be disappointing, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a disagreement is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad, it will be decided whether a person is good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. this doesn't matter that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data is also incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it is possible to anticipate data analysis of flu, limitous ways - by data analysis of Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news location. the success gifted in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked just fine, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it was simply not working, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data are experienced as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all of this error, data will look into decisions of life - at work, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- a field where some very smart people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. I recognized some samples by the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"do you ever have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a result, put this problem into its components, so you can analyse the components; as second, put the single parts together to put a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: get apart and setup."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">"they are not suitable to assemble the parts, and then to come to a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces once more complete, even if the information is incomplete, especially when the brain is an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think it was Netflix so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to understand their audience better, what else they would have been capable of. but the decision, how to make all these parts, come back again and make it a show like" House of Cards "that does not stand up in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show what meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way. "</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV ideas, then they chose an" alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they always could say: "we tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better choices, but I think things are wrong when data start steer our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order to forget that this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No question you will only shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">"I will leave it later, with a technique of technique."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I met some decisions in my life, whereby I would have listened to the ball in the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic building.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so perhaps the ball becomes wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is in us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that in spite of the great amount of data still paying off, decisions to be met, an expert in what you do, and risks to go."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"by the end, it is not the data, but the risks to land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
