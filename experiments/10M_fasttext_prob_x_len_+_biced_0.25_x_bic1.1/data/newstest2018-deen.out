&quot; Munich , 1856 : four cards that change your view on the city &quot;
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt where you@@ ths meet today .
&quot; a tomb chapel , where is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small vin@@ ed@@ ress@@ ers cultiv@@ ate the ru@@ sty reason of farmers .
the oldest official card Mün@@ ch promotes exciting stories about days .
&quot; it &apos;s nervous , when maps are not currently up . &quot;
this knows everyone who had to be exciting because the Auto Nav@@ i was instead of a stra@@ pping road to a green meadow .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlas , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are all other than currently - yet very reve@@ aling . &quot;
especially when compared to current online cards .
&quot; then , it becomes clear how towns and municipalities have changed in the district area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bayern Atlas is a tile carpet which is not recognized as such .
&quot; for cities and municipalities , more detailed maps , so @-@ called ur@@ anium blades , were incorporated into the great coverage card . &quot;
&quot; these were developed according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing management between 1810 and 1864 , and in the first survey@@ ing Bay@@ erns . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
Bavaria has occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops finally went down with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 1801 , it was the present neighbors , which created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Sur@@ vey@@ ing Administration . &quot;
the prototype for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is to be found as all others at the Bavarian State Library .
&quot; the comparison , for example , is the most impressive of the state capital . &quot;
the city expanded into all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is sub@@ jec@@ ting , which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map of 1856 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was arrested 21 years after the creation of the card , so 1877 , in the Munich district . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of the people are concentrated in 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where the West@@ park is today , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming , there is a smaller sheet with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten entries from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; primitive &quot; &quot; from which the base tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; there are little plots today , no farmers more - but small band@@ men of the plant &quot; land in sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green space is characterised by the north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 scene from the Oktober@@ fest , was actually a meadow , and there was no concrete desert in the 19th century . &quot;
on the other side of Is@@ ar the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the primitive place one reads in the district of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district court , not just the street names &quot; &quot; on the restaurant &quot; &quot; - but also in great letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here in the Au@@ er@@ field highway one once closed people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
there was a place there in 1858 / 59 in the Munich district @-@ Irish Institution &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ der headed the establishment of his psychiat@@ rist who , in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and ended , for example , the chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; he also taught the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , director of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients had been at first place , later on 500 seats were extended . &quot;
some point did not attain this capacity - the reason for the building of the county Institute in Hair 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist@@ s in Germany . &quot;
&quot; on the area of former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people encounter the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich . &quot;
&quot; the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and transformed him into a youth home with training . &quot;
&quot; the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich east is east , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , we built the Children &apos;s House &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - in a archit@@ ec@@ on@@ ical reference to the origins of the Ir@@ ren@@ aissance , which had been destroyed during the Second World War . &quot;
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was in 1856 as the &quot; main square &quot; where Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
a decisive change took place in the Second World War as well as in the heart of Munich .
&quot; the Allies were fired by the Allies , in December 1944 , many holes in downtown . &quot;
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English institute , small business houses and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days work on and on April 5 , 2017 , the Sp@@ at@@ enst@@ ich will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn station . &quot;
&quot; with the shooting gallery , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photo of today - and the hole in the Mari@@ en@@ hof will be re@@ plen@@ ished . &quot;
civil rights group released travel warning for Missouri
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ es has issued a warning for colored people due to discri@@ min@@ ating policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Committee for the Federal State of Missouri , which is scheduled to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of frag@@ ility , racial origin occur in recent times throughout the state and will be noted , &quot; says in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently said law of Missouri , which makes it harder to compl@@ aining , and the prosec@@ uting authorities of the state that oppos@@ es un@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate to min@@ orities , demonstr@@ ating the group to release the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , which people happen . &quot;
&quot; they are appe@@ aled or killed because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star . &quot;
&quot; we hear problems in such a frequency , which we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization exhibited for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group quoted incid@@ ents such as rac@@ ist violations of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances of the beginning of the year , after having no more fuel during the journey by the Missouri , and by the Missouri police arrested in custody without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recently published report by the Missouri Office of the Missouri , in which she will be shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and informed about their families , friends and staff , which might happen in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
&quot; people need to be ready to bring it to the state , or their relatives know that they are traveling through the state . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 of them in the year 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI @-@ rec@@ eding statement of the FBI , which ranks the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country . &quot;
&quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law , which would make it difficult to compl@@ ain a company because of residential or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) adopted a travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona after the United States committed immigration authorities to under@@ take people for mig@@ rant workers , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U for further development purposes . &quot;
&quot; foreign war@@ nings are generally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in the last time , stakeholders have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
wheat @-@ aun@@ ting project is elementary
the fisher@@ man Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ aun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU Corps Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have created a picture on the site .
&quot; when the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family in the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the village of CDU @-@ local association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann initially granted insights into its operation in which he supplies 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , and as well as many young cows , houses in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is responsible for him the alternative ste@@ ady supply for the milk of its cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ h@@ orts comes exclusively regional .
&quot; since he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of fishing ban , he described the fence as &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t manage top areas on der@@ art .
&quot; the green area for much work , much must be processed with the engine line . &quot;
&quot; we have been here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann stressed . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ter@@ al operation and processed these without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not use any bio @-@ operation . &quot;
mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the importance of the crossover project and is happy with the leaders . &quot;
&quot; at cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare , farmers would need to be supported . &quot;
&quot; you hope , that the surface of the surfaces could be moved out for a while . &quot;
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , are the people working in agriculture and are thinking about how they continue to continue their farm , &quot; the mayor stressed . &quot;
farmers are often because of the fo@@ stering often in the cr@@ iti@@ que
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 members of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 . &quot;
the dis@@ closure of the area is thus 40 hectares that cannot be applied until at least 20@@ 23 .
&quot; of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leaders was funded , a quarter of the village of Fis@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the farmer stayed 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km &apos;s fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of f@@ ences , &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and conc@@ ub@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Peter White , also firm for Peter White , was the best food produced here . &quot;
the state @-@ care centres ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state @-@ to @-@ state support of f@@ ences .
the aim of the Black Forest .
pre@@ condition is the presence of one of the l@@ p@@ r recorded pat@@ rons .
&quot; in addition , the area must not be dra@@ g@@ able ( Hang@@ ar over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the reception . &quot;
&quot; for the 2018 Fis@@ dec@@ imal Project 2018 , the application of eight participants is currently running with 24 plots , which would like to build more than 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the dis@@ covers area corresponds to 35 hectares , the estimated cost of more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking off the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as any other - hence the care of having staged down@@ fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , certainly did know what he did when he took an symbolic ancest@@ ry in an ov@@ y dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CNN on the proposals of the president towards dra@@ stic limitations with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller does not handle the statue himself . &quot;
&quot; a hor@@ de from Bo@@ at@@ ters and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ers would have landed him , if he had done it . &quot;
&quot; but he grab@@ bed its importance , and especially the importance that you were attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; Miller A@@ co@@ sta ch@@ imp@@ lies : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is objec@@ tively correct , but how he form@@ ulated it , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the elabor@@ ating words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state is not only any old immigrants , but the poor of the poor : &quot; your poor , your poor , and your afflicted masses , who are looking for free to breathe freely , / ho@@ wling of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ing waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
&quot; Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA . &quot;
this conflict due to the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
&quot; Lazarus and her friends who used to place their words after her death on the basis - knew very well , that they did a highly political action . &quot;
the sculpture was to show the links between French and American Rep@@ ublic@@ ans by showing the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom in a worn classic picture .
&quot; Lazarus changed these meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and they themselves have a completely different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poetry with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vism .
&quot; and precisely how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change this long back from the right wing . &quot;
&quot; the great Schrei@@ er Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for coming from Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was to bring to the American flame into the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot;
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
tor@@ ch shall not turn the way into the United States .
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the stand @-@ point of perception .
&quot; the great phant@@ astic act of Lazarus existed in it , as they see from the exhau@@ st@@ ive , el@@ ending , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys to the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense of being able to see the world from the perspective of people , seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
&quot; their statue says to them the words of hope , and of the welcome which they must hear . &quot;
&quot; and that is , of course , not to recognize the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; her tor@@ ch shall not ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is the only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ sty@@ ie Doyle reminds of a time when only two Sc@@ ots were to be a team of Great Britain
&quot; the performance director of athle@@ tics in the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record @-@ breaking Scottish athl@@ ete was chosen for London in 2017 on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland &quot; something special was developed &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it and we will continue to find out until we find out , &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot;
I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athl@@ ets think it has something to do with what they did .
British Athle@@ tics Men : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several Scottish athletes are medals candidate , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit while E@@ ili@@ ie Doyle was elected team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest .
&quot; their cap@@ tains was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a series of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very motivated . &quot;
&quot; passion and genuine sense , the e@@ ili@@ ie very natural , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth @-@ Silver medal winner who will compete in their fifth world championships at 400 m hur@@ d@@ les says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots in the British team are .
&quot; the best total number of athletes at the world championship were seven , which had been reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the mid@@ fiel@@ der Mu@@ ir leads on this way and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m is another Scot@@ sman , one after a great season , holding the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the teams states that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men are not only among the team , but in some cases also with medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about the team chapter , lies in it that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor to know , but to know that my team mates have voted for me and I have voted for myself , &quot; &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the vill@@ i , which belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb in Po@@ orts . &quot;
what my speech is concerned as a capitalist ?
&quot; yes , I think they went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to place on this home support and to benefit from that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it will be just a great atmosphere there outside . &quot;
blocking of critics on Facebook : do not worry about a public position if you can &apos;t heat the heating by voters
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him for all , from the interior politics to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he imp@@ lies with the criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he did not have his critics to silence .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; The freedom of expression may be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , as sheep are led to the slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked contributions of at least 450 people and have cleared their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained about this because of this week .
&quot; the governor of the governor dismissed the action as a fri@@ vol@@ an , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; many people said . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second highest ranking of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also sk@@ ill@@ fully sent to use Facebook as a primary means to inter@@ connect with his voters and play his ha@@ ired head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons that come on the side of the govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax @-@ Dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse argu@@ ed the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that blocking the comments had nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too simple to use the picture of tro@@ t or sp@@ amm@@ ers , or h@@ ass@@ met people that sw@@ aying the whi@@ p . &quot;
the post spoke with some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a parish , no tro@@ ll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respec@@ t@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not professionals . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in His post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
&quot; attor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ass@@ met , but she asked for them . &quot;
&quot; I said polite that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate and other latest news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news show &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people are taking place on the same subject , then they are rather ab@@ used as a so @-@ called collective use , and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the employees of the governor as a &quot; concentrated spam assault &quot; would probably call other &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic , or delete a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is far more cleaner than in previous time , if one had done the same time that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guiding hand and to burn protest@@ ers . &quot;
exactly this is exactly digit@@ ally done .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials that critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
&quot; President Tr@@ ump is den@@ ounced by Twitter users , who were blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell to Virginia last week .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County , last the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to US District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a voters from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
it should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers varied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous boxes , struck on its leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had tro@@ ll@@ s tro@@ ll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used P@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that Wash@@ ing@@ ies decisions . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ itions that critic@@ ised his position on the contract of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain critic@@ ised , overwhel@@ med his ministry , according to historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t put them into silence .
&quot; freedom , Expression and Dis@@ courses belong to our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; former Europeans n ° 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days on domestic comfort , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led the Nor@@ di@@ field links to the end of the past year , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is involved with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches its fame with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a fantastic job when he placed this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance .
&quot; this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
&quot; Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , even though he won in his 32 @-@ year career at the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly important , &quot; said the player in South@@ port , which is located in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , as it was taken in the year after I won them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday this year , returns to the action on home . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it &apos;s always a bit more , when you play at home , &quot; OR@@ R said the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed it again and played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad about how it went so far .
&quot; the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup @-@ captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six sh@@ all@@ ots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free of charge , the parking is £ 5 a car with a budget and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer by passi@@ v@@ smoking
fewer people have died in the past two decades of lung cancer in the past two decades .
&quot; to that result , scientists from the University Clinic of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) are in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer risk cases attributable to passive smoking per year , Hei@@ ko Becher said . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved to this subject from 1994 to this subject . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were 400 lung cancer diseases caused by passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove itself as a very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and are halfway up in time , &quot; says the director of the Bau@@ haus Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of house@@ connections , the situation is more complicated than presum@@ ed , since the ground is much scattered , which is not indicated in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which is rest@@ art@@ ed the construction work , represents a big problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of the motor@@ ists in front of red lights and bul@@ locks is enormous , &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the liner buses are entitled to drive .

poverty and death in the indones@@ ian gold land
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner , she does not use stove . &quot;
she even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai government in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house is normally called a sweet potato - local as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the ch@@ aired k@@ olle is taken from eag@@ erly , washed hands and swallowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture , where she also carries its daily work , such as clothes with mu@@ red water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; the youngest of the four wives of her husband , their fields were assigned . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ ie is common here .
&quot; of course , it can be too dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many are drinking heavily , and there are the soldiers . &quot;
&quot; nobody wants to walk after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life of the Hochland von Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elders should vote in the occupying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which touched for independence against the Dutch rule , turned back quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and foreign journalists or ob@@ servers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially split into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua where the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea became the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as se@@ clu@@ ded as it is desert . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive with the car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the town with around 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo sho@@ res , and from corrugated walls , which were converted by rust in various yellow tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , wei@@ rd because journalists and practically no fore@@ igner . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ ua called a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , handmade Tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and their brigh@@ ten rock . &quot;
&quot; previously , we had only leaves to our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality rates in Asia .
but it is Indonesia &apos;s golden land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable Gold@@ mine of the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort destroyed gold and copper in value of 3.1 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua dispos@@ es of wood resources worth $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; however , these riches are a source of affliction to the Pap@@ ua that ensure that Indonesia is a powerful presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort had paid local military operations between 1998 and 2004 , almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ anian demands on major autonomy thre@@ aten this Golden G@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military . &quot;
mass killing in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ bal in the 1970 @-@ 1990s marked for genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; we Are all dec@@ asing &quot; says in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 , in which reports on the atro@@ cities of the previous year are , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ ly@@ me are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal precipitation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
bolts have intensi@@ fied because Pap@@ u@@ as resources have a state of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development is changing , since Muslim economic growth is based on the most populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ cant@@ een sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pean@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people are strug@@ gling to stop here .
&quot; the migrants began to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved to the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
it has cost the local Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , well known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised during his election campaign in 2014 to tackle ine@@ qualities and lit@@ igation in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total of 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua a little changed , and today the loc@@ als feel the loc@@ als . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice is re@@ produced , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months to Jok@@ ow@@ is initi@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas Car@@ ols in front of a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took part in their tone , and came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk drunk , hun@@ ted the group with their guns , told victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired up the children &apos;s group .
a child who was 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo hit so difficult that he fell into coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and the things cal@@ ved the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a football pitch before the local police station and the military command centre to request justice . &quot;
they wore crushed hunting grounds and led the orph@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle running and a bir@@ d@@ ang im@@ itable - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago trunk .
some protest@@ ers started dra@@ gged on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood has been heated , the soldiers was sent to an order via an internal radio : &quot; &quot; when the crowds make more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TIM@@ E , which was not released to local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned my head , I suddenly shot in my left wr@@ ist , &quot; &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colorful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame is still not known , who fired , but says that the ball from ranks of the ranks of the soldier came together . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired . &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cousin , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was it , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who has only one name , the TIM@@ E in a dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him .
&quot; the Chief Inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to &quot; ins@@ ure &quot; their station , because they would be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we have to defend ourselves if people are threatening to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ers were killed and many more injured . &quot;
the messages about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ u@@ ura , in which he utter@@ ed sympath@@ ies for families of victims and s@@ ware , to tackle the historical ab@@ duction in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like that this case is immediately solved , so it will not happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Wir@@ anto Security Officer announced that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historical human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
but the talk started almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these bre@@ aches , but there are processes that need to run through . &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat , when he said in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E on 5 June and said that he had no plans to establish a complaint in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is legally defined , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he said that 11 cases of human rights activists in the East Timor were accused of crimes against humanity , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses were submitted in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Pre . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to such claims with Gri@@ mm@@ ers .
&quot; I interviewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , are afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the opinion that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
&quot; he says that he was beaten by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; says he . &quot;
the shooting @-@ ies have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in the Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a con@@ frontation between the vill@@ agers and the Manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring an un@@ conscious man into the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man who was drunk 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ v , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
non @-@ regulated vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company premises .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded to them by removing the warning shots .
but native people say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started on the crowd and killed a killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured parties have arrived quickly so is TIM@@ E . &quot;
&quot; I have hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament called on to withdraw the involved agents and return the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai always was a trou@@ bles@@ ho@@ wit@@ ch for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the satisfaction of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in green Hochland von Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many of them joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , who claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by sus@@ cep@@ tive attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian troops . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to the recent years , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and arbitr@@ arily detained in custody , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua the Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for loc@@ als . &quot;
bread is just as far as range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and Fru@@ it and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
&quot; most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
ten pieces of not@@ a co@@ stly only 10,000 indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; during the time , economic ine@@ qualities between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown since the opening of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ire airport in larger numbers . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs , which exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and wealthy mig@@ rant workers . &quot;
Pap@@ ua have rarely found the capital or the necessary skills to perform their own company competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
Isolation is the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions regarding the coverage of international media remains . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of a lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission to the movies . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign , which raise restrictions on reporting , not re@@ alising transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists attemp@@ ting to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ us@@ al and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; a lack of press control means , that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ots and the Salom@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , the &quot; &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia it is still a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to hide the evidence of human rights incid@@ ents . &quot;
the people on site want more foreign governments to consider this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , visited by the leadership of the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura , on May 4 , so@@ wed their silence and urged him &quot; &quot; We want freedom , &quot; &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session but anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua states that they probably won &apos;t be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a human being who has good int@@ entions , but it is surrounded by people who are involved in the panic attacks , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chair@@ woman of the tribe . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it is under the constant threat of a common military , is in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , had to consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; fault , &quot; which he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ens brought a final symbolic act of the p@@ ite : the bodies of an op@@ ter was buried on a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they might know that they might never get righteousness , but at least they don &apos;t forget their crime . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with fierce head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire cap@@ turing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from 337 metres high , 79 @-@ story buildings . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which swe@@ pt through the high house in just two years , called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , violations were no reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm , and at the cry of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; a residents told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters . &quot;
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said the units of the fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 am local time ( 00@@ .00 o &apos;clock GMT ) destroyed the fire and cooled down the building .
&quot; the government said , they work on the provision of accommodations for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident can be reduced to safety of materials , which are used in outer areas of high schools across the world . &quot;
&quot; a study by management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damages caused by the covering , outer covering to decoration or isolation , came . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police said they believe that the system of plates made for isolation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June had contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : continuing Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has passed through its large Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Minh City meeting in the Ho Chi Minh City , this sport revolutionary suggest@@ ion , Davis Cup singles , was not yet to play on two winning positions , which does not support two @-@ thirds majority by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but also very estimated five set classics remain the most traditional compet@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore just scar@@ cely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members do not have adopted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historic competitions . &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said .
&quot; they will continue to work , to improve the compet@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; even after the vote , the proposal had already come before the suggest@@ ion that the final on a neutral place had come out . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be able to host the host for the first round in the first round . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the costs of the organizers , the requirements for training places , etc . facil@@ it@@ ates and players will complete less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 US passengers , prohibited objects into the plane , finds a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by air passengers show that more than 20 percent consci@@ ously banned or un@@ consci@@ ously forbidden objects on the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the airplane , while they accid@@ entally prohibited knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent claimed that they were dis@@ bel@@ ated , that they are wander@@ ing with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey was conducted at more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger trav@@ ellers rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; of those surveyed said they have tried to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , who were members of Generation X . &quot;
the most common items that were deliberately given to T@@ SA agents were of food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent claimed to have borne objects with blades by security control , whereas 2.2 percent of those surveyed respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they were deliberately banned drugs into the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I asked travelers in all the country to find out how many accid@@ entally sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware by the airport security and how many have done it intenti@@ onally . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely to know or un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly - by security , those who were most frequently flying . &quot;
&quot; the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA direc@@ tives are complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uns@@ afe that liquids can take her away or how much of them .
so it &apos;s no surprise that the biggest amount of conf@@ is@@ cated items banned liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought T@@ SA could view books as sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel their order
&quot; electro @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k , with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &apos;s Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; so far , he has previously signed that a part of the customer has already withdrawn its un@@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the triumph@@ ant numbers of sales increases and more enormous closing targets , Tesla @-@ boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has the first time to betra@@ y another , less glorious number : the cancell@@ ations made during the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in the past few months , Mus@@ k had applied more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extradition are just beginning . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k has been a : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 shareholders , 6@@ 3,000 had already been withdrawn . &quot;
&quot; critics , however , had always noted that it is merely a binding reservations . &quot;
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tesla has paid the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; Reser@@ ved deposits &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at present 45@@ ,000 such un@@ binding reservations are currently used in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; the cancellation of so far as far as twelve percent of all orders could be solved , however , the Tesla boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets does not aim at demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tesla supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models are to be taken - 500,000 , by 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are present each day . &quot;
&quot; if you order today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; , we can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla has created it , its brand new , never again tested production lines without larger breaks with maximum utili@@ zation . &quot;
many experts believe that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to larger del@@ ays , then the in@@ obligation of reservations could become a problem for Tesla . &quot;
&quot; then the company cannot hin@@ der the company in@@ satisfied customers , in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ e moves back because of the hes@@ itation of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a &apos;s policies to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after having been accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the Chief of the Environment Protection Agency , took back his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules to reduce emissions smo@@ g causing air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities as far as previous administration . &quot;
he did not claim the law@@ suit against his prior position in a Federal Appeals Court .
it &apos;s about a time limit on 1 October for States to keep the standards of O@@ zone in 2015 .
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will hesitate to release a year in order to study the plan more time to study the plan and to avoid , &quot; to engage in local decisions or to handic@@ apped economic growth . &quot; &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s prosecutor in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent of environmental protection provisions . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has been repeated and re@@ iter@@ ate regulations of blocking , or delayed the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden change from we@@ d@@ nesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the position of regulatory Roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Justice in Washington decided that the EPA @-@ car@@ et@@ aker has exceeded his authority when he tried to commit the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company for monitoring and reducing meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; in a report published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his turn @-@ st@@ ice at o@@ zone standards can easily take the read@@ iness of EPA to co @-@ operation with the States by the complex process of tim@@ ely fulfilling the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under former administration , the EPA often did not hold the dead@@ lines for the implementation and then waited for determining activists and others , and in an agreement the appointment for the execution &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation by judicial procedures , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority , which gives us seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt asks his &quot; auth@@ orization to delay and all the other legally available required &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; in the last month of per@@ mitting law , the implementation of the 2015 rules should be delayed by at least eight years . &quot;
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney , Eric tail@@ der@@ man , who led the US coalition led the EPA in this week , said the group intend to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;

Tum@@ ors celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , on Sunday 16 July , at 4.@@ 30 pm a ser@@ en@@ ade is invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether id@@ yl@@ lic location and beautiful views of the resort , the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can en@@ chan@@ ted from this powerful place .
salvation and preser@@ vation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors to their concerns .
&quot; Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ izes : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ n small i@@ od@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us chapel was first mentioned in the Württem@@ bür@@ g@@ ischer &apos;s documents : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the present parish church on Tum@@ ors with the Vog@@ ue &quot; on Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark . &quot;
&quot; the word according to the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger hill , except the former parish church , belonged to the church or the patron saint , and not vice versa . &quot;
&quot; so , people also lived there . &quot;
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still seen in the village of Tum@@ ors today , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 are all historical sites .
the patron was originated from the early medieval times .
&quot; one Lord , who built a church , emigrated , and occupied with a parish , remained the owner of this church and could inherit these origin@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; so , he was the right to use a priest , or submit a new priest for a priest . &quot;
three alt@@ ars there were in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greatest of the two will be at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell was first heard in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in 1796 the French troops entered the church nearby .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
remains the remains of the church in 1809 .
the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius Cem@@ etery served as the final resting place for the dead in listening to the dead .
in 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was broken .
only the tower was left .
&quot; in the New Year of August 1834 , a storm divided the steep@@ le storm and half collapsed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent evil , the tower was broken off . &quot;
only the still existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ em is the successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius plant . &quot;
&quot; as organis@@ er invite the friends and promot@@ er Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , at the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ chapel . &quot;
&quot; designed by the Com@@ bo of Kepler @-@ Gymnasium in Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matt@@ eis , is designed by the Com@@ bo of Kepler &apos;s Gym@@ n@@ asi@@ ums . &quot;
town in Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 o &apos;clock .
&quot; to the end of Ser@@ en@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows down to the forest , &quot; the organizers provide the fantastic view . &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only with dry weather .
&quot; the organizers are hoping for many supporters at the receipt of the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is important for tum@@ ors and listening welding . &quot;
the friends and sponsors of tum@@ ors feel particularly committed to the home care of Ser@@ en@@ ade @-@ Organ@@ iser Walter Mart@@ ini .
Verein plans to prove auth@@ orization of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim is w@@ aging , no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; is entitled &quot; Land@@ coun@@ cill@@ or Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) promp@@ ted its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the city border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal exists a wind force concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy systems are generally possible , at the same time , the concentration zone has an exclusion of wind power consumption for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones should avoid a &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; although a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but it had not been approved by District government in Düsseldorf because of a form . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning law , approval was granted to the constitutional law and did not withdraw it , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city council has again decided the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a approval from the district government is still standing .
&quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; &quot; with this point , the issu@@ ance of the establishment of wind energy systems are legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been made since a week of the circle four , &quot; &quot; stated a spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; the circle takes them to the occasion , to test the matter again . &quot;
&quot; however , they likely do not mean that the procedure is stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a glance at the administrative court on Thursday , the circle on Thursday was unable to point towards the arg@@ umentation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 metres high wind turbines . &quot;
&quot; already last year , the company in which the city has been part of four times , P@@ acht@@ ler is closed with the owner of about 65 hectares large land . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind energy systems , the energy demand for about 11 400 households can be covered , which corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ liter households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; in the summer of summer , fourth green light gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at Aachen and Germany as well as a stake in the wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor : woman dies in terrible accident
&quot; one horri@@ ble traffic accident took place on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 , between Low @-@ Port and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Circle ) . &quot;
a woman was wounded and fatal .
two further people were injured .
the national road was closed over hours .
&quot; after police reports , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ nich was backed with her passenger car with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as the accompanying person &apos;s L 333 towards Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealers plan &quot; Home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
private facilities and people from the region are to be re@@ discovering in the city center in September .
&quot; the Trade Association and the city administration will take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 , to attract the inhabitants for the shopping spre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the commercial company , Christian König , is said to confirm the &quot; home Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend to customers that offers customers their own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; planned is a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present their training sessions . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center should invite the &quot; &quot; night sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; &quot; shops . &quot;
targets not only for residents of the city and in the vicinity .
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , a Internet video and printed bags that show on the Active weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
the city administration and commercial use co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the &quot; Attra@@ ctive Center &quot; project .
&quot; these include new offers as the first &quot; active day &quot; for Brun@@ n@@ en@@ fest , selling well @-@ selling Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts to move to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the negoti@@ ating on parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; furthermore , customer potential should be re@@ opened or re @-@ opened . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many natives have lost the city center shopping out of the sight .
&quot; at the end , all of them would have to help lay down the city center - up to land@@ lords , the factories of all the city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was made to conquer the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y with a network that made them partly , king in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit Stre@@ ich , leader of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Mü@@ hl@@ hausen , divided by the nationwide third &quot; homeland shopping &quot; day for the first time in five Thuring@@ ian cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , So@@ bal@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should show &quot; for the appreciation of local trade , and make its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners also make sure that each citizen can influence his direct act as a direct environment .
&quot; two dead , and several injured after the explosion at U.S. &quot;
&quot; during the construction work , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot;
new more people were hurt .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis , two people have been killed and nine wounded , some of them difficult . &quot;
according to the fire brig@@ ade was on Wednesday ( local time ) another last in critical condition .
a man died when a part of a school building crashed near the explosion .
&quot; one first , however , was born dead later . &quot;
&quot; with the dead , employees were at school . &quot;
as a lucky cause we suspected the authorities working on a gas pipeline .
&quot; during the holiday period , few people stayed in the building of the Min@@ ne@@ haha Academy . &quot;
Tr@@ ump translated by telephone lines from phone calls to Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders from Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump asked in a telephone conversation with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , publicly to say that he would not pay for a scheduled border . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President insul@@ ted him because he had den@@ ounced the wall , he said to him , &quot; This you can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed to reveal an aggressive exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia , take over &quot; ridic@@ ulous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stupid , &quot; after completing a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call , after he had told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most pleasant call for all the day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ man Ford Mercury drove a group of spectators at the Rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver , had reached the bridge , a group of white men came out to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man aged middle aged in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous suit - took a long train at his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants woven the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want to see this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ ared the man .
get it out of the car !
the silence is torn apart than a young black man from passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is only a re@@ location . &quot;
&quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all in the audience got very real sigh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizens of the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge are coming back to im@@ itate the night , in the two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , and George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one has ever been indicted for murder .
&quot; it is truly in@@ comprehen@@ sible that in all these years , no one person was arrested , even though we see them in our communities , even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps the organization of re@@ positioning . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spots on a history , but it is a burden to our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ s@@ led state of Georgia and a life citizen of civil rights .
&quot; for him it serves as a dramatic call for action , and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an in@@ justice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosec@@ utions , we want ending , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we can &apos;t get to cure and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
&quot; a place of jurisdiction is a beg@@ ging towel about the suffering of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 . &quot;
&quot; according to FBI files , that were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ Process . &quot;
but nobody ever was indicted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions became known throughout the city : Politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision made by the Supreme Court of Justice instructed the black citizens to be held in Georgia for the first time in the summer campaign in summer . &quot;
&quot; at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the FBI of black colour guard Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nice H@@ ester , settled during a battle , supposedly due to a woman . &quot;
&quot; Bro@@ oks said that rum@@ our was in the city , that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore she was not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ lord , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from the prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and their cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when she was taken away from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge were approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b had surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison who has prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings , &quot; includes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that there was a conspiracy between the government and local law en@@ forcement , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , evidence , and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks make it more attractive .
&quot; it was an election law massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you vote , and if you vote , you will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual sales of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; its representation is descri@@ p@@ tive , for@@ warding , and is based in a kind of deepest rac@@ ism , of which many believe that he does not exist in America anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to look and look even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are confron@@ ted with his hem@@ or@@ ality in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to listen to what I have done . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - a dozen white and the rest , when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene co @-@ director .
&quot; he played the role of the chef cl@@ an@@ co since years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to that time . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a tried to play the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett h@@ ester their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cri@@ es and pushed him to anger , that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , dar@@ ken@@ ed to my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a replies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the same time .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still gig@@ gling . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think white people back then &apos; n --- &apos; he said &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ched one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you only need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and exactly there , the energy in the space , a sense of camera staff , replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy making it right , not just because of the game , but because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time , if Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , it says sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one is laugh@@ ing .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and quick .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman clothed with a mour@@ ual dress , stands on the p@@ ses of actors and leads cheap Holidays &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot; &quot;
their voice breaks in every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , there is a group of about four dozen people sweat and tears off their eyes . &quot;
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down the street . &quot;
&quot; they have experienced almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as hydr@@ ation , when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point , Mor@@ de has stayed an Ane@@ cd@@ ote , but now , when they found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels split . &quot;
&quot; if the last score of the song sounds , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and inspec@@ t the body name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ op to their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ ur a little boy , as if it wants to remember . &quot;
&quot; after a couple of minutes , Gre@@ ene Thanks a lot - and suddenly it is over . &quot;
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ x rope and wi@@ pe her tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ced Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the Cl@@ an@@ ner has played . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ con@@ a surro@@ unds two of his players , and breaks down into their arms , which breaks the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks with him . &quot;
it &apos;s okay . she whis@@ pers one of the women .
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this out of a reason . &quot;
later the audience uses the actors together for dinner together .
&quot; a white pair of Atlanta show a white pair of Atlanta , with a black pair , which they met just now . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ insky also strug@@ gled to find words , which has left the performance . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people coming , which look like you and that do , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what really does that really do with me lets me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; today , it is called police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks &apos;s farm holds at his table , he eats and commemor@@ ates the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the conclusion is inspired by a certain way , because it describes the horror of what we suffer , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is like we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; he who does not study his own story , who does not know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmer@@ ling &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental works , director Frank Cast@@ orf set up a colourful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of gigantic , six floors . &quot;
&quot; the pi@@ vot@@ er stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows an arbitr@@ ary street corner with the wall of the wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ key &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; a open Mercedes classic car , pos@@ ing in which the Rhine bre@@ wer is pos@@ ing as a rock band , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; ol@@ oured oil thread remin@@ ded to Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhine bre@@ eders - sung by Stephanie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke L@@ ank@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ise as already in &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;
&quot; together they are managing Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , rent a che in Hollywood @-@ manic@@ ured into the trunk and give the Kra@@ ko@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the gorgeous fi@@ del@@ ity of Hagen that surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight bo@@ xer .
brutal the scene when he hits Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) has to believe in it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
&quot; in the meantime , Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who is mo@@ dest@@ ly celebrated his hands and the hands of the Merkel rust@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; great appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the large heat again in an empty leisure . &quot;
the appearance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ ete@@ am .
&quot; in 2013 , he still had to leave a g@@ ell@@ ent whi@@ st@@ le concert in 2013 , there were five years later , in which the inherited &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls . &quot;
fixed in Katharina Wagner is likely to have happy about that .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf but it was also an understanding of its view .
I prefer a positive result .
Max quantity works as volunteers
they work in several places in their volunteers .
where to anywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt , at the furniture store , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven at the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked in the open all day at school .
how are your experiences with that ?
&quot; quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with adolescents , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are 26 years now , a late volunteer volunteer . &quot;
how does this come ?
crowd : I have trained high school education .
&quot; and then , a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; I know for me , that it is wrong for me and I do something else I want to work with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what do you do .
&quot; a social year , there is a gli@@ mp@@ se , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point , maybe also , really is . &quot;
and was it like that ?
crowd : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my study in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule . &quot;
&quot; isn &apos;t it unusual , while volunteers have several different applications ? &quot;
&quot; quantity : yes , it &apos;s very variable . &quot;
it always comes on where to make his FS@@ J .
it can make it possible from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was partly in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
&quot; for me , that was the right thing that irrit@@ ated me . &quot;
I could recognize and see my own strengths as it really runs out .
differently than in civil engineering ?
&quot; quantity : well , here it is not about to ex@@ ert static . &quot;
&quot; one has always been in front of another human head , each one has a completely different story . &quot;
whether a refugee is whether a youth that has been taken out of the family - you always have to go individually .
very interesting .
and they had no contact points ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is a area that gives a lot .
&quot; plenty of love , much kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s life . &quot;

&quot; the British Ministry of Education Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will decrease further 3,000 jobs and be shortened by 72 per cent , since another restructuring program will be started to overcome the pressure that the company was confron@@ ted with . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2019 , the job volume , the General Secretary of John Fall@@ on , announced primarily for the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous re@@ organisation where 4,000 jobs were lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a third cost reduction programme for cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in order to revi@@ ve a business with a quick step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which had sold its involvement in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House last month , said that the outlook for the business year will remain unchanged , after it achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kabul con@@ voy to Kabul : NATO soldier killed at self @-@ murder
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kabul , a soldier of NATO and several other injured , say civil servants . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpre@@ ters have been injured , shared by Nato . &quot;
&quot; in the case of un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
&quot; bombing is the last violence , which Afghanistan met this month - more than 30 people killed in a mosque in Her@@ at . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul . &quot;
&quot; in a opinion on NATO &apos;s opinion , the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan Army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; worn bomb &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured in a stable state are located and in the U.S. military hospital at Bag@@ ram &apos;s air@@ field .
&quot; correspon@@ dent says that the growing strength of the Taliban and group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the UN , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian victims in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban said they had done this attack . &quot;
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the center of the city , killing more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , killed by the Taliban in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence emphas@@ ises the pre@@ ference security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is decreasing the number of U.S. forces to support military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents may say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in the last weeks also have caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policy , and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ rection To Del@@ aying the Smo@@ g Rule by Kl@@ agen
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has rev@@ oked a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , which , under which the states are oblig@@ ated to im@@ pose the Smo@@ king @-@ causing emissions . this was a day , after 15 States def@@ endants the agency for step@@ ping def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone Rules 2015 &quot; and said , she show the commitment to the agency , working with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and hereby we react to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; in June the intention of EPA announced the intention of EPA , which should be measured in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions , to establish where entries must be made to delay more str@@ ingent air quality standards - to delay a year up to October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Columbia , filed an action on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to re@@ plen@@ ish a wide range of environmental influences , which is imposed by former President Barack Obama to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have caused the response of the Democrats and nature @-@ groups that worry about the effects of larger emissions to public health . &quot;
the EPA &apos;s website says that the inhal@@ ation of air that contains o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and reduce respiratory symptoms &quot; as an example As@@ thma .
Communal Living Room to Community
&quot; at the end the decision was clear : at two objects , the Municipal Council decides into a joint hall in the future residential property . &quot;
&quot; prior to the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the lack of land was signed , says Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will still take until the church community is owned by the community , there is no planning access to the ongoing project by a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion on a joint room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square metres - and adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square metres floor space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and majority of the community swe@@ ars , such a common room just not as the meeting point for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ atory living , but open to the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word of &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the turn . &quot;
&quot; the decision will be disp@@ at@@ ched by the provision of funds for the current budget already in autumn , by funding options . &quot;
the construction is in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent favorable . &quot;
&quot; the decision looks forward to signal the investor from the investor who wants to throw from the legs in this regard , that both arti@@ llery - as well as the ambient temperature - as well as the construction height - as well as the construction of economic power - that would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried So@@ h@@ mer is this addition . &quot;
when it helps : unanimously he plays the panel .
not so easy to get involved in the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings , with which one is not so well ahead , it is now resting in the common room out of the window , says : &quot; I &apos;m very difficult for this . &quot; &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger speaks to the common room - but absolutely against a communal participation .
it is behind a conce@@ aled sub@@ sid@@ y on anyway assets or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is just not so , as with the acquisition of the area , there is no supply , but also get a real one in doubt , in case of doubt , the counter &apos;s speech is . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers request , to cut the decision according to orders , takes place three fears . &quot;
&quot; for example , it remains with two objects to agree with the original program that Stefan H@@ aller puts it together : &quot; &quot; if we put the decision so , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

hiking in the Har@@ z of Stern
&quot; in Har@@ z , the federal state is supposed to be the first &quot; star trail . &quot; &quot;
this is planning the &quot; Ob@@ servatory St. Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
there &apos;s a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; coming to the information of many har@@ dening visitors , said it . &quot;
&quot; he binding nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to set up the planned route tables and inform you about stars and stars .
&quot; in a first phase to 2018 , the club &quot; &quot; Pri@@ able installations are planning to five or six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; en@@ quiry came to St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ er , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
information on boards should be added to the internet .
this is why the site selection includes a good mobile network reception .
accessibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
&quot; later , the train path gets extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the sign @-@ path the viewer learn a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; stated the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is stronger than another , although he is much further away . &quot;
&quot; it is also facil@@ itated , in which constellation is a selected star , and when he is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest @-@ standing Ob@@ servatory of Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the site is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
frequently there came from the Mil@@ ky Way galaxy and even the Andro@@ meda Galaxy with mere eye .
&quot; in the university city , there has been something similar to the planned star of the planet since 2003 at the initiative of the Planet@@ arium . &quot;
&quot; beginning before Prayer Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , that forms the interior of our solar system , the planet will lead up to Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory , as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ ks ( municipality tracks ) with the Planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
&quot; the stel@@ ae with the individual planets , including the P@@ lu@@ to @-@ plan@@ ed P@@ lu@@ to the end point - are positioned precisely in the distance and a scale of one to two billion . &quot;
&quot; earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun is at least 75 meters from the sun , at least 70 centi@@ meters in the sun . &quot;
the planet &apos;s total distance is a good four kilometres .
&quot; during the light of sun up to P@@ lu@@ to about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to walk with P@@ lu@@ to . &quot;
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
but the march to the next ball was last a half year .

&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia , which should be in a coll@@ ision course to stage the exciting boxing contest in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;

four Ver@@ sions to T@@ ire T@@ ire
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , four people were injured during an accident on the A7 . &quot;
&quot; following the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16 : 30 was lost shortly before the centre of the market . it is thought to be controlled by a ty@@ re @-@ plat@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; the car turned to the right to the ar@@ ches , where he over@@ threw himself and then lying on the roof in the gr@@ asp . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were injured in the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the last through the ambul@@ ance service , A7 was locked in the direction north for about one hour , then the traffic on the left side of the road was passed by accident . &quot;
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; triple chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann is hoping for the season open@@ er in Bruns@@ e points after 2 : 2 in the season open@@ er of Bruns@@ wick .
&quot; with the first seasonal game Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , there were not the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Erz@@ gebirge mountains , the thres@@ holds is to be further optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after an open attack , the mar@@ vel did not want to fall anymore . &quot;
&quot; for the future , it will be so that no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) is located on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is better getting better in preparation with the triple chain than with the triple chain .
&quot; yet , I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , but Hoffmann is sure of his business , &quot; because we just have in the triple chain to the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build a good , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the requirement is , however , that we are yet more harmon@@ ious , and we do not afford such a lot of ab@@ duc@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also travels to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; however , if you can speak to a mis@@ o start from a mis@@ sl@@ ated start , I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points , we will certainly focus on tro@@ phi@@ es , surely we will surely talk of a regular season open@@ er . &quot;
his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; I took the start into the season only after six to eight days of play , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , who would not speak of an advantage against Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be canc@@ eled due to a temp@@ est . &quot;
&quot; now they can play the season quasi with a home match , &quot; &quot; said Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann may believe that the players from Au@@ e might even be some fresh , as they could have a heavy and complete game as Fort@@ una for rent in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the inner defence of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; although guests from the Rhineland , as a lightweight Favor@@ it on Sunday , go to the En@@ counter at last ( almost ) finished stadium from Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we go away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , is nak@@ edness , &quot; says Fun@@ kel , whose balance is quite positive at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there are no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga , which you have to hit from the out@@ set , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Music coach . &quot;
&quot; such statements would be met arro@@ gant and super@@ vis@@ ually . &quot;
&quot; and so , Fun@@ kel wants to experience his players on Sunday . &quot;
new results of the Swedish asylum evaluation tests released
&quot; the recent findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden who were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years old . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Ver@@ ts@@ .@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should make the assessment of the ages to be more precise after the Swedish migration authority ( mig@@ r@@ ations ) was crit@@ ici@@ zed for errors during evaluation of the correct age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations sent 6.@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency proposed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; possibly is under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson , by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results were constantly permanent . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in statistics of last months , the figures are quite constant , &quot; he said the journal The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases , in which the person was evaluated as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has been lied to about his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there was 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the subjects were 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ adet examined the 5@@ 81 results published , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that it would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical retirement schemes , for X @-@ rays of white teeth and MRI images of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also crit@@ ici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they went sooner or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
the biological age to assess this way is very un@@ certainty .
&quot; if we can &apos;t be certain , we should not do so as if we could it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of adult child is in@@ correct . &quot;
&quot; the largest risk is in it if the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are moving forward .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven @-@ tonn@@ e concrete was installed on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Bau@@ manager at the Department of Road and Transport in Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , at the same time , work began at all three gentle bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the construction is scheduled for October , and is sure that the schedule will keep . &quot;
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ ault bridge with concrete , which is faced with red bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , she has come to the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure stability and transport security , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , the bridge on the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 metre wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge fl@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; this is a Rand@@ om attachment , which is also used as a company path . &quot;
on Friday the southern part of the bridge is supposed to be a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge fl@@ ap .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to run .
the particular thing is that it is finished in manufacturing ; a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ for@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented fires .
special finger@@ tip has the installation of lines due to the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a glass fibre cable , which many companies are connected . &quot;
the natives were informed of the project in advance of the work on the project .
&quot; furthermore , fish and cru@@ st@@ ace@@ ans had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the tree building and the collective in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic @-@ lane is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
construction work on the bridge at L@@ ter@@ b@@ acher &apos;s entrance is the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the &quot; Tann@@ häuser &quot; hotel and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is closed .
the cost of the three bridge alloys will amount to 700 000 Euro .
the whole is funded by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
&quot; it is not so frequent that parties prefer to move on a strand , but if it comes to an alternative to Germany ( A@@ fr@@ o ) , everything else is difficult to bring to a hat . &quot;
&quot; the Parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) represent a broad alliance in the cra@@ y@@ day of the party ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell as a poster depicting a large election campaign . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag on 24 September , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are already on @-@ site hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the African leaders , but to demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city @-@ pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; Show more at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ n@@ en@@ platz , but it is now on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colourful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , the chairman of the forum One World and one of the main organizers , really pleased : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and plenty of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problem , &quot; says the woman who brought him with him . &quot;
&quot; the police found many officials from Ger@@ ol@@ stein , pointing to the railway station , especially at the railway station , just a few metres from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ D volcanoes , he has been trying to get such an event and received the surcharge . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there &apos;s a cancellation , because because of the already built @-@ built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there are not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; looking at the event at the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz he says , &quot; This is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peace@@ fully . &quot;
&quot; it is also doing : at about 20 o &apos;clock in the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz a band provides entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle diverse speakers , including the Rhineland @-@ p@@ fal@@ z@@ ic @-@ president Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the hall , some 200 listen@@ ers await that the top can@@ did@@ ature for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch kept their speech@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the police remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; somewhat more than one hour takes the African event , the guests in the field have a longer breath , but also there is a short breath away . &quot;

Kri@@ sten Stewart speaks about their bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese , they will eat it until the end of their life . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart very openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; once I bite in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
the well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood star was that of their &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson who ultimately suc@@ cum@@ bed to the end .
&quot; despite all this , the brunette letter from the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with him , whom I did . &quot;
&quot; do you think about , I have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten gave the fact that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
so it hasn &apos;t been confused or ob@@ struc@@ ted me .
I never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; it was particularly suffered from &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but in the school time she &apos;d rather disgu@@ ised as a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really was very hurt .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a bu@@ b . &quot;
I really felt att@@ acking and dis@@ gra@@ yed and dis@@ gra@@ ced .
&quot; now I look back and think to me : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public they don &apos;t enjoy love life : &quot; people expect you to be a certain way , and it anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; you may call me some wis@@ ank@@ bar , but I don &apos;t like to justify the whole public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night with a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party . &quot;
&quot; if you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that at the time it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a big announcement in the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not seize the democratic can@@ did@@ acy Hillary Clinton .
Justice according to Forbes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state was elected in 2016 .
&quot; Forbes states that he has inherited coal ins in five states , and has inherited a coal store by his father . &quot;
it is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republican National Committee adopted a declaration in which it said , &quot; The party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather be working for us to make our land great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Gou@@ vern@@ es and the control of the least legislative bodies in history is the announcement of Governor Justice only the last re@@ jection of a party , which is from above to bottom without leadership , and not able to find a positive , adjusted message , &quot; said the R@@ NC Chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement by C@@ BS News . &quot;
CO@@ E pra@@ ises the &quot; honest &quot; Russian accus@@ ation for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as apparent ap@@ ology from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it was not the moment for the country to be taken back to sport . &quot;
Russia &apos;s Athle@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the ILO conventi@@ ons on the eve of the World Athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight d@@ oping the d@@ oping .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were cut gold and silver medals in competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for maintaining the ban , which was launched in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) references to state sponsored D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the Rep@@ orters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation is aware that it has experienced some pretty hot times , and everything is possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; CO@@ E said , &quot; &quot; he was also &quot; &quot; pleased that Russia accept the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think that progress were made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this was not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the proper athl@@ ete from the with@@ ered system , &quot; &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start World Athle@@ tics World Championships , starting in London on Friday , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setup . &quot;
&quot; drug skills are still in@@ adequate and forbidden Trainer are still working free , he said Rep@@ orters in London following a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
proc@@ essions for in Mali stressed soldiers
&quot; at a funeral in the northeast Fr@@ itz@@ lar , some 1,000 people have remembered the two soldiers with a helicopter type in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high security arrangements .
&quot; for an un@@ clari@@ fied decline , Defence Minister Ursula and the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing . &quot;
they described the two retired pilots but the &quot; C@@ ould of her Speci@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; we bow down to the highest victims of the Federal Republic of Germany , who declared it in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old chief be@@ headed from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
&quot; her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday , accompanied by a death of the Bundes@@ wehr to the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter . &quot;
&quot; at noon , only the relatives arrested in the Church last . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral proc@@ ession began in the circle of family , eng@@ aging friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot;
&quot; among them , H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and director of the German army Volker Wie@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; the grapes were ro@@ ared with ro@@ ses , and the relatives were in the arm in the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; before the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; Secretary of Defense from the Le@@ yen , who described the soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and set up . &quot;
&quot; in Fr@@ itz@@ lar , he was built in Fr@@ itz@@ lar where he was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regim@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent , to whom the soldiers were , stated : &quot; if this occupation could not turn away , no one would have mo@@ cked . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali was not being pointed out by the Le@@ yen : the mission is dangerous .
&quot; but he was also of high significance for a country , separated from which we are separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral service , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not work . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave to his wife
&quot; after his death , the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife . &quot;
this divided the Royal House on Thursday .
Danish royal couple is traditionally buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard prepared a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both of them .
the Queen had agreed with her husband &apos;s decision . she was further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried was still un@@ clear .
&quot; however , he did not understand the intention of being buried in his French homeland . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a h@@ eh@@ l from that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; following the thr@@ on@@ ization of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to be king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 he retired to reti@@ ring , taking the title &quot; Prin@@ cess@@ es . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted to see himself as equivalent to his wife - not even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief spokes@@ woman of the Danish Royal House . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ olds will ultimately be un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not understand the intention of being buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ oc@@ racy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French message .
&quot; during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew on , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year @-@ old shelves . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik vo@@ iced about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was sw@@ amp@@ ant , I preferred wine instead of beer , so@@ cks instead of stri@@ cken , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ fts , which I used instead of Virginia and Tob@@ acco , who had the call for the call to be the brand of soci@@ etal intellec@@ tuals I could not hope for retro@@ spective . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were the same two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants a swi@@ ft re @-@ election
CDU and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; defe@@ ating Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after losing the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , he does not want to re@@ sign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the resolution of the Parliament was acquitted . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising end of the Federal Democratic Party in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot;
five months before the official date of the country code lost the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover with so their scar@@ ce A @-@ vote majority in Parliament on the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the old Green MP El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets set up their step with the non @-@ nomin@@ ation for the 2018 election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she explained in Hanover on Friday . &quot;
CDU faction leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend to record them .
&quot; thus , CDU and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony &apos;s Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relation was vice versa .
the new landmark day is elected regular on 14 January coming year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must decide whether they could continue to rule in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Weil , however , holds up to un@@ kno@@ ding@@ bar that the Land@@ tag has quickly compl@@ ained its self @-@ resolution solution as possible . &quot;
the CDU faction is expected to decide on more progress on Tuesday .
&quot; the state records also sees the possibility that the Prime Minister draws on the trust of the prime minister , and cho@@ oses his successor . &quot;
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
&quot; these possibilities must be legally inspec@@ ted , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; one will discuss the issues in peace , if they are legally sensible . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ we@@ ens step &quot; but somewhat cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the polit@@ ician himself stressed : &quot; I &apos;m not a representative .
I feel very good . &quot;
they described as a tag of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the back@@ sliding members for the return of their comp@@ atri@@ ots .
&quot; we assume , of course , that it has received its Land@@ tag , which she has received via the green state list , with immediate effect , the state @-@ president Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Green An@@ ya P@@ IEL said , &quot; &quot; We regret the decision by El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets . &quot;
she deliberately decided to lead no language to the group .
&quot; even in front of the background , that there was no un@@ sustainable differences , we cannot do this step . &quot;
SPD Federal Chanc@@ ell@@ ery candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the CDU out of the El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets for the CDU as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , who quickly choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
the outlet T@@ western is the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; in her last emotion and in their Fr@@ ust their personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised the SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ tri@@ gen@@ y and tries to beat out political capital .
defe@@ atable CDU faction Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its members to record El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets into the CDU .
&quot; the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ jack@@ ets in front of , with personal care@@ ers the outcome of the 2013 country election . &quot;
&quot; the CDU was the strongest force in the SPD , the SPD and Green party in the country but had a hau@@ te majority of voice in the country . &quot;
&quot; Home Affairs Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ ern , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed about contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect you .
Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editorial offices in Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt : how can consumers protect against pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only check all consumer goods and check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp @-@ up pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , according to everything we currently know , a health threat is virtually impossible . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis action - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance from the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really noticeable ?
food surveillance is the task of the federal states .
&quot; however , my house has immediately been posted immediately and since dis@@ closure of Germany &apos;s strict exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade fair also has the same as the producers to worry about selling products are bu@@ si@@ able and health thou@@ ght@@ ful .
&quot; if with eggs of the resi@@ li@@ ary level of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not bu@@ si@@ able . &quot;
&quot; un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time are not the firms for inno@@ c@@ ence .
are manufacturing plants and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to such knowledge , production plants does not meet immediate guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they need to calculate with economic damage due to alleged illegal practices . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is little checking out in harvest . &quot;
is it missing on the staff or even on the hanging jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , there were just the official controls which have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; to the truth , however , food fraud and criminal energy cannot be excluded from 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a consistent recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of such events and hand@@ over to the State bar in the cases where crimes can be discussed , of crucial importance . &quot;
I have already made several times clearly that I expect from the responsible authorities to expect a mosquito statement .
is the regular alarm mis@@ m in food sk@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get only safe and bu@@ stible foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry is used , consumer goods and consumers are righ@@ rup@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the company &apos;s agent , tra@@ ders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
basically must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des Fi@@ pro@@ il in the attitude of life @-@ food animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it must be consistently high on all levels and work with high pressure .
&quot; from all relevant authorities , I expect the fact that the atomic fact will be imp@@ acted and im@@ bur@@ dened . &quot;
how to move the financial rules of football on Ne@@ ym@@ ar &apos;s move to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to aim at off the issues of European football matches , Ne@@ ym@@ ars world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will be offered for Paris Saint @-@ Germain in the UEFA , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEFA &apos;s Life , mean that PS@@ G has to point out that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without considerable losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian market from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary which will amount to $ ten million per year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ars moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G is able to make money loose with security , so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar writes and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the teams through the energy @-@ rich ruler of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may apply a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must pay with legitim@@ ate acceptance sources , which allow them to break @-@ even point in their on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
&quot; in 2007 , FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini for the UEFA president in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs in their quest for success proved enormous debt , effectively che@@ ering and ris@@ ky to recru@@ it themselves when banks or owner withdraw their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P passed away from concentration to the debt of clubs on monitoring their losses . &quot;
the change meant that the business model used by Roman Abr@@ am@@ o@@ vich originally bought a club with potential in 2003 and then strongly invested to build the crew and build a global brand - to a harder matter .
&quot; during the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P delay period , which runs until 2018 , clubs may take losses in the amount of € 30 million . &quot;
&quot; although Plat@@ ini fell from the presidency in the UN in 2015 , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to deter them to deter excessive expenditure . &quot;
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G paid the Buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package , it can distribute the amount of accounting for the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the eligi@@ bility for the next five years is to be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G was a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time , 82 million dollars ) , which later reduced to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that teams of the Champions League of the 2014 @-@ 15 season will be limited to 21 players who otherwise remain limited to normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ leave their financial views , by using their income by companies that are associated with owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ ian company could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ship should exceed the default market rates , the UEFA would not apply as legitim@@ ate income . &quot;
it was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ings of the PSA runs from Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar will come about payments by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar In 2022 , cont@@ ested that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Championship amb@@ ass@@ adors will be easy to find out such a maneu@@ ver for the UEFA regulatory authorities . &quot;
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA is still attentive , to keep the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEFA has no pre @-@ preparing conversations with PS@@ G on Ne@@ ym@@ ars Transfer , announced on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of an@@ ym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were unable to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has generated sales of more than 10 million euros in 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ym@@ ars arrival a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing De@@ als , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales . &quot;
&quot; the Association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the signature . &quot;
&quot; the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football player , and she tried to prevent N@@ ym@@ ar @-@ suit by saying that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear@@ er case of &quot; financial aid d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in reference to Kat@@ ars the last owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the Reserv@@ ations of La League against a state that co @-@ financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
it becomes very difficult to respect the financial FA@@ IR@@ PLA@@ Y because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such an actor to represent a country .
Swiss is looking for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ants

how many applicants have to call on the new call will not be betra@@ yed the Swiss .
&quot; in question , only Swiss manufacturers are coming . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort of renewal in spring 2018 . &quot;
for S@@ DA the biggest Swiss chocolate @-@ manufacturer was not achie@@ vable for a statement .

&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who are now playing adults , is less emotional ro@@ oted and his par@@ ody goes more after the casting films of the 90 @-@ s , like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that cra@@ dle the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at a point of a point , a character is characterized by an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &apos; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ stak@@ eholder ) , now Rom@@ aut@@ or , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity still not lost .
and there is still another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant plot where Ronald Reagan ( even Mr. Sho@@ oting ) is involved in the Ronald Reagan ( even Mr. Sho@@ et@@ aker ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; anyway , the exchange rates are the best part of fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is particularly fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt D@@ alli@@ on Unter@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Singles &quot; , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old bu@@ zz . &quot;
there are the moments of accid@@ ental mad@@ ness that could heat this fran@@ chise as a sort of repet@@ itive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieved what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band as they will visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its east @-@ against @-@ west ring @-@ thro@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka are a director with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director , to be a found TV series , two police officers , two police officers , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism , and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main tro@@ t - a hard @-@ ten@@ ant Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i whose dialog@@ s of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice days to see ( the police sp@@ ends the time to watch chess in television as they might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of the famous spokes@@ persons - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ger Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a decent play for the upcoming game . &quot;
but Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of one of desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer that we@@ ars a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
&quot; with six episodes , it moves away , and com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; which has been edited on a lower length , his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re could provide better , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef once again visit the American embassy , whose lobby has always occupied by two thick men who are w@@ asted by a bun@@ ch of Hamburg . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary audience is that Western culture can do everything for food .
the fic@@ tive Romanian creator had not been wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with it .
impact on drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have been a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning the Black Forest district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Konst@@ anz , Esslingen and Stuttgart searched out numerous objects such as the public prosecutor in Constance on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 and 77 , 15 sec@@ ul@@ men were arrested and issued in arrest warran@@ ts issued arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials provided major amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; in the same Raz@@ cia in Italy , two persons were arrested . &quot;
&quot; against the two susp@@ ects , German arrest warran@@ ts issued German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
the two will presumably be delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the promotion .
&quot; in total , over 300 polic@@ emen were employed . &quot;
&quot; the ma@@ fia will organised crime crimin@@ ality , severe violence , attempted murder , and rob@@ ber@@ y . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the public prosecutor &apos;s public prosecutor against organised drug dealers in southern Germany have been determined . &quot;
&quot; between the government agencies in Constance and Palermo , a real exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , on Wednesday morning the wholesale use was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in regard to the studies of the investigations , Italian nationals with regard to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired in a ta@@ vern , is likely to go to the gang of the gang . &quot;
den@@ ounces major g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner @-@ register
&quot; data of citizens who should not appear &quot; : according to a report , the fore@@ igner @-@ register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot;
the lead to part serious mis@@ decisions at asylum procedures .
&quot; for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has brought attention to a media report . &quot;
&quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the registered data could be taken in case of asylum procedures and deportation orders &quot; of partly serious mis@@ decisions , &quot; in an analysis that is presented by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the register , according to figures , there are ten million people in foreign nationals , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data are therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts would not have been good so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer in life or citizens who have become German citizens and don &apos;t appear to dive in the register . &quot;
&quot; in@@ correct data entry may slow down the recur@@ ring processes , i.e. it means further . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics of more traveling people , EU citizens are captured , who would not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; however , such fake regulations led to a dist@@ orted debate on dealing with the way out of the way , which is therefore in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children to go back to Italy , if they travelled from there . &quot;
&quot; from an internal paper issued by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ er Zeitung &quot; reports . &quot;
&quot; in the paper , the B@@ AM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - except for infants and small children - according to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , such as the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , refugees in the EU government is responsible for refugees first . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the home country . &quot;
&quot; for the reasons , the Office now write : &quot; meanwhile , the recording capacity for families with under@@ age children has increased significantly in Italy . &quot;
Italy have given guarantees for the recording and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) keep these comm@@ itments for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees to the Dublin agreement .
&quot; internal political spokes@@ woman of the German Parliament in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children imp@@ lications for lack of conditions in the Italian asylum system , illegal conditions and a threat of child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood produced by Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach had already ordered the blood@@ shed for other people .
&quot; at least of the twelve citizens , who were honored on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who had meanwhile donated 50 litres of blood in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the congregation in the meeting of the Common Council has to don@@ ate multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is awesome , as our body is designed for this , and we have the don@@ ors respect for the don@@ ors who have their blood for foreigners , still un@@ profitable , &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the rotary ladder of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preser@@ ves are cut into their parts . &quot;
so many people could benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported the actions that were carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year , with 114 don@@ ors , we achieved the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ K Kreis@@ eur@@ ship . &quot;
obviously the change to the theatre house has led to higher participants in a few years ago .
&quot; already before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta Um@@ ber were among the multi @-@ professional don@@ ates and were awarded for 50 pieces of blood don@@ ate each . &quot;

Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the decline of inflation would have exceeded the spec@@ ulation over a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth is &quot; &quot; continued &quot; &quot; when they kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the Bank &apos;s policy makers ( M@@ PC ) voted with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , with less members in this month , because the weak economic growth has increased the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly inflation report the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 on 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on household income would continue , with inflation likely to rise to just under 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they realized that in the next years &apos; interest @-@ rate period would be necessary to bre@@ wing the inflation of Bre@@ xit , and that the loan costs may possibly be expected to rise to financial markets . &quot;
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut business cycle that was issued a year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be necessary to al@@ locate the financial plan for the financial planning , even though it is expected that they will be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the frame of this system - with 115 billions of Sterling . &quot;
&quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as the pressure on the real @-@ deposit of households continues to consumption . &quot;
&quot; to interest rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain imp@@ lication of monetary policy &quot; would be needed to reduce inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; dimension than the markets . &quot;
the markets forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; the bank , however , emphas@@ ised that increases &quot; &quot; progres@@ sively &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the Bank forecasts for this and next year &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year , 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May . &quot;
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change come after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have increased the rising expectations for a rate of interest and GDP growth increased in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
&quot; growth is expected to grow at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by an increasing inflation and low @-@ level sal@@ aries , because the tigh@@ ter takes even worse before it gets better . &quot;
&quot; she added that the monetary policy in the coming years does not prevent the income break , &quot; &quot; but it added that wages at the end of their three @-@ year forecast &quot; will recover significantly . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pounds , which is due to a lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
the decision comes following a year after reducing the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU @-@ vote which caused the sin@@ king of sound .
&quot; the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years , until this will completely reach the prices and economy . &quot;
&quot; prior to the last ruling of the bank on the interest rates , the call had increased after a rate of interest , since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision makers in July a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation declined from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank predicted that this was expected and put on again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that its aims at the ratio of 2 % would be &quot; completely &quot; to be one of the weak pounds .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ ale , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent return of the s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the credit@@ ors asked for a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those in which existing De@@ als are exp@@ elled and the new mort@@ g@@ ages close , and many with free rates and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should under@@ cut HIV drug 10.000 people
patients will be obtained from September after a conflict in front of the high Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS access to a &quot; trans@@ genic &quot; HIV prevalence treatment .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ dat@@ or exposure risk in high risk analysis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infectious disease by around 86 percent , now delivered by health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he prepared to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal uph@@ eld a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice in the previous year , that the N@@ HS had to pay the authority that the local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the chess announced on Thursday announced that N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens was welcomed as &quot; important new intervention &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) declared this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to be able to enable registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ operative phy@@ tot@@ xes ( Pr@@ EP ) is a consequence of HIV drugs that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection of infection .
&quot; to take the Pr@@ EP in front of intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body are a person present to prevent HIV infection . &quot;
such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; to those who come for the treatment in question include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , appropriate participants are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy . &quot;
&quot; people who live in England and registered with a domestic doctor , can also en@@ rol for possible participation in their local participating sexu@@ al@@ clinic . &quot;
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of drugs during this week after an international competitive pro@@ curement .
&quot; the study will assess the whole potential of Pr@@ EP , collected by clinical evidence as it is targeted and implemented in a large scale . &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention was to supplement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress during demonstration of one of the greatest health challenges of mankind .
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive Officer ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted specifically for needy and dangerous people , the opportunity to change the British HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; in September , people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England will have to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subjected to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which will lead to many many lives . &quot;
we welcome this announcement .
&quot; Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority now must be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the Pr@@ EP test medicine has been acquired , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Sharon Hodg@@ son , shadow @-@ health minister , said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after months of delay and hes@@ itation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how trans@@ forming this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of these life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as fast as possible in the whole country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they contribute to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
life and clever designer tricks have changed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , reduced from a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and has sold .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne said . &quot;
I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
&quot; to me this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
&quot; I fell in love with her , and made a special offer on this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1.000 square feet was completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a scre@@ ened layout - one had to go through the kitchen to go into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to optim@@ ally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; to this end , she instructed the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to take advantage of 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home not only a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand . &quot;
fan had to be creative thinking to solve the submission .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together , without having to g@@ aps ourselves . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about to build a simple platform , but put the steel so that it had the right height above or below . &quot;
this arrangement gave it Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ am@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of sk@@ e@@ wers plays an important role in adding theater , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red , to have him longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , units offer space for all the j@@ ars and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can exclu@@ de the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a little bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is important to it , so that if you push the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the cle@@ ver@@ ed use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to win additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ diment@@ ary form , real estate agents are entering and a calculation based on the base size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the floor area and use high @-@ quality materials that make room its luxurious benefit . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore helping to create an emotional ties in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself in electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
&quot; it shows that an apartment is characterized by good design , and increased square met@@ er@@ ical value of something standard , which can transform something quite literally . &quot;
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could choose to leave this not . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar property
&quot; two brothers are four decades , after her Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation for one of the biggest real estate imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as worth $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business can be split . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp argument on the separation is held in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties in value of more than half a billion dollars , since the family started a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , since the family in 1973 . &quot;
there the West@@ co je@@ ans family founded Je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for US $ 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lut@@ is &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the town of City , the development areas of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Colin is described as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lut@@ is , about two thirds of the company assets and Paul approximately one third . &quot;
a jurisdiction states that this means that Colin is worth $ 316 million and is worth $ 176 million in the value of $ 176 million .
the allocation of real estate and cash has proved to be a Pro@@ bl@@ emp@@ point .
&quot; the following Colin suggested plans have left him with what I kept for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in an initial affair . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , the first hearing of the Court of Justice took place on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now fight for control over the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims to have him excluded . &quot;
&quot; argu@@ ed , Colin argu@@ ed that this was not true , but throws Paul , some of them in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early affair that was submitted by Colin , he says he is hoping to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes , that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the case with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both parties produced law firms . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her husband &apos;s husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a shop in Bruns@@ wick in the early 1970s . &quot;
&quot; they used the safety to purchase the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Colin opened the first je@@ ans@@ er family . &quot;
Colin tells that he began to be West@@ co when he was the High School in my last years when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoping to continue their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other Brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lut@@ is Group &apos;s group , which Colin claims that Mark had paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , so Paul says , &quot; concerning the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot;
Colin has kept back very well though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media adopted Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers .
&quot; only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I can really say much , &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad , that my brother Paul decided to compl@@ ain me and take our sur@@ name by the dishes . &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin made a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have wished that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he is still looking for a solution . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , this hope seemed to be over . &quot;
&quot; our affair will be solved in the near future , &quot; wrote Colin . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps new Chief of Staff plans to limit the President &apos;s Media Ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence .
others tried it and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO says that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss in a more uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , joined the White House on his first day of work with senior employees , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wants to repair : bad information taken into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly told the employees that information should flow on him - whether on paper or in mail - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps Relationship to Television goes back for decades - and now , where he is at the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if the Tr@@ ump was angry because of a fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he had received a fair coverage of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former election campaign Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against POL@@ IT@@ ICO . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter Hab@@ it under control , according to six former election campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media sum involves a permanent praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter is ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridic@@ ulous .
perhaps these campaign leaders know something we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps T@@ we@@ ets would have included even more ignition material without their interventions .
we will probably never learn about the T@@ we@@ ets that Tr@@ ump hasn &apos;t sent .
&quot; if his staff have made it a few times to keep anger from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; but no one has to prevent it resol@@ utely , that Tr@@ ump contro@@ versy sur@@ mises . &quot;
&quot; a part of the problem consists that people in a White House , which consists of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material , which may potentially promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO - dealing with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors , to bring un@@ question@@ ing information of strategic reasons . &quot;
this was an example that was described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump is able to react to negative press releases , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that it &apos;s out that they come out . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened at the end of February , when somebody ign@@ ited a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ oc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , called the source behind a cluster to be at the White House . &quot;
&quot; though Johnson had been banned for ch@@ ic@@ ans permanently from Twitter , or that he had no specific evidence or that he expressed false accus@@ ations in the past . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and started question@@ ing employees of Wal@@ sh .
&quot; gold @-@ makers added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to implement and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do three months later .
&quot; maybe he will prove himself as an effective manager as a pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his imp@@ ul@@ sive self , and his counsel@@ ors are still looking for influence . &quot;
this un@@ changeable factors make the Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Master searched for crimin@@ als get post from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of people will pray and hope . &quot;
the police in all Europe will ship in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought out crimin@@ als are not known , are references from the population hopes and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol was reported on Friday by the promotion , which follows the &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; adv@@ ent calendar from the winter . &quot;
the experiences have shown that many vol@@ atile and holiday destinations hide it by Euro@@ pol .
a total of 21 postcards collected for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 the website is www.@@ e@@ um@@ East wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online purchases could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to the publication on the website . &quot;
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owner of West Mid@@ lands are again with some determined trav@@ ellers on the foot of war , who negotiated one of the church drawn to return a field in front of their men &apos;s houses . &quot;
&quot; trav@@ ellers have par@@ ked their 20 caravan on a field outside a wealthy road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transport , after they had been kicked out in May without being deported from the Council of excav@@ ated dit@@ ch to prevent their accidents . &quot;
the tac@@ tic group found a gap in the defense and pushed its vehicles by a section that remained un@@ impe@@ ded to find a track .
&quot; angry residents urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they are going on Monday evening after they were sent out by Bentley Heath where they have thrown stones to the pass@@ ers .
&quot; the Council must act in action by shame to implement the problem , since it us@@ eless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
the passengers were there in May were moved and are now back again .
&quot; more came last night , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to change it , keeping a long run @-@ instructions to protect their park . &quot;
&quot; I am not happy at the stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my par@@ dest@@ iny , if the Council can &apos;t even stop it . &quot;
&quot; a native people who did not want to be called , said : &quot; it &apos;s ridic@@ ulous , we have just seen the last round of these trav@@ ellers , only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
the figures have increased this time and even saw a horse in the park area .
a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorized camp on the land beyond the stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we seize the necessary legal steps to continue working as soon as possible .
&quot; in order to support our war@@ d@@ iss@@ ure , it is very important that there are many residents to report a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check , when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel bir@@ ding the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year .
those are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the hotels Birken@@ hof by the then ambi@@ ence of the company mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30 000 nights have been lost each year , and revenues generated by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of the figures of refugees that came to the County , the hotel building was offered as a collective property , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the order of a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel site .
&quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the community at that time . &quot;
&quot; but especially Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts Upper May@@ ors Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel site , and he already spoke of serious interested parties in the house at that time . &quot;
he should keep right .
&quot; the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ Hotels with Managing Director , Birgit Sch@@ erer in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ians , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter Ob@@ ject .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ians and one in Bad men m@@ b .
&quot; Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former hotel of Birken@@ hof there has been a long time building container in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear that extensive renov@@ ations are expected . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings to be dismant@@ led , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there &apos;s still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be re@@ done in the Black Forest .
&quot; rooms are equipped with large @-@ separated showers , the input area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; all should be &quot; &quot; fair to be near , &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer cho@@ oses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to move to the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but even on a high @-@ level centre level . &quot;
&quot; Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms , set wide up , explains Sch@@ erer continues . &quot;
&quot; both individual resorts , groups or business people are to feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause he already led , so she@@ erer . &quot;
the city &apos;s performances are the same with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants not to determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; almost under one million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; external plants are also applied on the front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , which is open to the public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimi@@ stic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. special medi@@ ator uses Grand Jury
&quot; in Russia &apos;s affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller is alleged to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury according to a report . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the panel recorded the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; entitled to trust people . &quot;
the newspaper valu@@ ate the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigation and intensi@@ fied .
the radio station CNN reported that there was already the first charges of the Gre@@ ase in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin since a longer time targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines if there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are to stand in the election campaign as advisor of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller received more and more jun@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the magni@@ fying glass . &quot;
&quot; the Washington Post , several weeks ago , wrote that the Sonder@@ ese Tr@@ ump personally joined the centre and examined the accus@@ ation of whether the President may not hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jura is to check and decide the evidence in possible frag@@ mentation due to whether the charges shall be charged .
&quot; therefore , Grand Jur@@ ies are also called conc@@ aten@@ esses . &quot;
&quot; mostly they are switched on , if it is a major and controversial cases . &quot;
the process is always closed behind closed doors .
&quot; in addition , the panel is also enabled by the public prosecutor to charge people under oath . &quot;
&quot; according to the radio station CNN , pre @-@ charges were issued , which turn around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; persons who were involved in meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report . &quot;
they should also provide documents .
&quot; besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps counsel@@ ors and father @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ hner and his dam@@ aging campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort was involved in conversation . &quot;
&quot; right on Thursday night , on Thursday night , on Thursday night , the US television reported that Mu@@ eller won &apos;t be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that it should be necessary , quickly act . &quot;
&quot; however , it has to be called , however , that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide about the survey of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the suspension of the Gre@@ mi@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concerns of president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening made an address in West Virginia to represent Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the theme will give the Democrats an opportunity to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he kno@@ w@@ ingly nothing of the establishment of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; these work , however , usually work in obe@@ dience , he stressed . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates every action which accelerated the work of the special service in &quot; f@@ aire &quot; way .
&quot; the former FBI boss James Com@@ ey said three times , that not opposed the president . &quot;
&quot; I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey fired .
&quot; due to the root of these accus@@ ations , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump became no@@ isy , he did not want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; in June , before a Senate committee in Tr@@ ump , Com@@ ey asked him to investigate an investigation against the then national security advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under large pressure due to the investigation .
&quot; following US media representation , the White House collected material against the special issu@@ er and employees . &quot;
that loos@@ ens spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump mu@@ eller is released .
&quot; unlike a more independent president of Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller sent a position in which he could be fired by the president of the Ministry of Justice in theory . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of Republican and democratic sen@@ ators placed on Thursday law on Thursday , after which the special agent could not be released so easily . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ice@@ berg is driving in the Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a gigantic ice@@ berg has dissolved itself from the scar@@ ves nearly seven times . &quot;
this was divided by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; over a trillion tonn@@ e of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer large Kol@@ oss t@@ oss now to the north and will probably need two , three years until it melted . &quot;
&quot; it is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the largest ice@@ berg , who have registered researchers in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; as far as climate change played a role in the demol@@ ition of the iron branch , it is un@@ clear according to research data . &quot;
&quot; however , there was a series of unusual co@@ ps in the region for some 30 years , the U.S. research center for snow and ice cream ( NS@@ IDC ) writes in a fact . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the broken fl@@ oss was so far a part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le flo@@ ats on the sea , and is fed by great gl@@ ac@@ iers . &quot;
it is growing steadily towards the sea and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s lies south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula .
north of this Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ ises was the equilibrium of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ ting a few years ago .
&quot; a complete whi@@ st@@ le was falling there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there are some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s are in danger , because the front edge is not so far advanced as at present . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice top stand under tension and can disin@@ teg@@ rate if there is a slice . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg do not increase the sea level , as they swim on the water and p@@ ushes the ice as much water as it is according to the melting pot . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the el@@ ic@@ ulture leads to the glacier that leads to the sea directly into the sea and much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the level of sea level , but only in small dimensions , the British research project writes to the Ob@@ servation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI @-@ data , Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ S@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth biggest scho@@ oner on Antar@@ c@@ tica after A@@ WI . &quot;
&quot; on the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge of the free ocean some 200 metres . &quot;
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural face , and not a direct connection to climate change , the ice plate comes into a dangerous position , &quot; says Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary , by the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most broad@@ est retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists had disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ fer will be back and fall back in the long term , and possibly coinci@@ des , &quot; said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man , added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this trend will take decades .
&quot; even though these researchers will not lead the demol@@ ition of this gigantic ice@@ berg , not on climate change , so in the past decades , however , there are very many ice@@ bergs in the Antar@@ ctic peninsula . &quot;
this long skir@@ t of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has dropped by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
the increase in temperature is contributed .
&quot; the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has risen in the past 50 years by around three degrees , and t@@ ame it to the areas where the temperature is fastest . &quot;
CDU wants pet rate to the staff
&quot; because it is increasingly difficult to occupy freely @-@ going positions , the CDU included from the employer association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer break , there is 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first working day behind .
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously very demanded .
around 620 applications were recorded for this year to be recorded .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continued to focus personnel to handle the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are at M@@ ett@@ mann county as well as 50 in the district . &quot;
&quot; for example , doctors and engineers are searched for general administration . &quot;
&quot; the CDU would also want to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , with the initiative of skilled professionals in the administration . &quot;
&quot; according to the request of the parties , the administration must develop a concept for recru@@ iting and personal development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term demand for professionals , but are future @-@ oriented approach to the Can@@ didate . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept was to orient@@ ate and orient@@ ate concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include a training offensive , demand for CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds like a good approach .
&quot; because the circle has to do with staff problems , which one didn &apos;t know earlier . &quot;
other cities are recru@@ iting good civil servants and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech has a real &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; to this end , a high number of employees who put sickness or age caused by the service . &quot;
&quot; highest time to act , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , Group leader of the CDU , continues with his party even beyond the common motion . &quot;
he had already been sor@@ row@@ ful for a fine surprise when he asked the personnel cost @-@ covering publicly in question and the other parties thri@@ ve .
&quot; people would like to be checked , that all possibilities will be checked to facilitate the exit from the municipal employers . &quot;
&quot; if we don &apos;t want to get a satisfactory solution here in short term , the trade union with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated cities - a pet rate . &quot;
&quot; so the CDU , the employees and officials have tried to pay better than it actually sees the tariff for public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently strictly prescribed , increases or more money only if you are moving into a higher level , which orient@@ ates itself at vocational years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle are growing ever more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established , where employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stit@@ utes law . &quot;
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers land Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone to NGO Mig@@ rants Res@@ cue Bo@@ ats
&quot; in Italy , NGOs who are able to use the life boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they don &apos;t have to continue their operations for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs have not signed a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ n@@ itis War@@ ning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organization &apos; Youth R@@ am &apos; because their team had worked effectively with traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way , which makes illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation , which has been in operation only since one year , refused to express itself further to the Italian State School Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we &apos;re very sorry that we can &apos;t operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can ass@@ ert all the charges that are currently being collected , only after we collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; Youth R@@ ased &apos; , which have been monitored by I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that its crew will be delivered directly from men &apos;s hands on board , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can take off , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such cl@@ am@@ ers allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the assassination of the State Prosec@@ ut@@ ts , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected to susp@@ ects about the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , which monitors rescue missions in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; under the code index , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officers on board who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations , have previously prepared to hold on the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily , but acceptable if they would not be any significant changes or abilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel Prize @-@ winning organisation Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ n@@ iti also said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy had strongly declined in the last weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guards and cooperation with local citizens &quot; master fruits . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tun@@ nels , &quot; the Minister said . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month over economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali for measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berlin Out@@ posts &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ enheim in the North p@@ fal@@ z for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and S@@ ights . &quot;
three be@@ friend guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine fall of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyard to the Micha@@ el@@ chapel above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; the view@@ points followed , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the for@@ gery of forest and the down@@ stream planes . &quot;
there was always longer ste@@ als for the long trio rewarded .
the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the sal@@ ine and the popular worm market .
&quot; once again , look@@ out look@@ out to the look@@ out spot , connected to &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate climb . &quot;
&quot; over the last two days , there were many altitude meter . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and annex@@ es were welcome . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ ker involved in the open @-@ air formation of healing br@@ ine .
&quot; in addition , Neu@@ stadt was also controlled . &quot;
&quot; after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer@@ zer forest of his best - sporty and cul@@ tur@@ ally - to know . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundesliga is ready for e @-@ sport
are the sport stars ready to sit in front of computer consol@@ es instead of getting through to the stadium in wind and weather ?
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long been a long @-@ growing sector , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high tracks . &quot;
this is also recognized by the first German lig@@ aver@@ ages which are increasingly involved in this area .
&quot; at the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , which later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to enth@@ use the brand new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Executive Board Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
he is certain that there are some clubs on this train .
&quot; on the upcoming weekend , FIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; in which the gam@@ ers will compete in various clubs . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified . &quot;
also Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile been a agency for virtual football player .
&quot; in particular , the real soccer must deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people go to the stadium even in the future , &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent emails under contract , you could be present many times more frequently in these markets than once a year , to send the federal government to Asia . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; when the e @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League of Legends &quot; , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike , &quot; or the FIFA World Cup FIFA will be counted on competitions . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sport , also in the normal sport , Li@@ gen have already established themselves to compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and with the Asian Games in 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it all about a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the not@@ ion is certainly ordinary . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber@@ y has long dealt with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; it also need cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction capability . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise in the console , but exercise their body and watch out on the diet . &quot;
the fat player is a good player .
but F@@ rob@@ ber@@ y also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is always a theme . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult at online gaming , and in the scene failed the structures of the classic sport . &quot;
the researchers highlighted the high inclusive effect of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; players are internationally , like a big global family , since there is no inter@@ cultural Hem@@ m@@ ons . &quot;
a study conducted by the management consultants Del@@ o@@ itte as well as the Federal Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) says the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; by 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales are expected to lie at 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football league , this is little bit . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics , the Conrad Roy to be committed suicide &quot;
&quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend by text and calls to suicide . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were suspended on currency . &quot;
&quot; in June , Carter was condemned by Conrad Roy &apos;s negli@@ g@@ ent murder that took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing , &quot; My family is in@@ consol@@ ing . &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until calling .
&quot; she had faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy have been suffering from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red pants and a cream @-@ coloured Bl@@ use , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , folded hands and down@@ wards @-@ oriented eyes when they were condemned . &quot;
&quot; he reportedly killed Conrad &apos;s actions , &quot; said the State Court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has taken over responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no pen@@ it@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters attor@@ ney said that it was a &quot; awesome circum@@ stance , which they are completely regre@@ t@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosecutor declared a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , which said that there is no one day in whom I don &apos;t smoke the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I would like that he is proud of me and as I am with everything , I try , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us to be there for his sisters , is it in it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would be &quot; persecuted by the knowledge , &quot; that she would never be able to participate in the marriage of her brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person to have , with whom I have been together since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep my life in my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legally preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime committed to commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was killed by a carbon dioxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case drew national attention , after car@@ ters published text messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging out , spring from a building , enjoy yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent them in two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on vacation . &quot;
&quot; in the eyes of his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Everything that you have to do is turning the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Mon@@ iz said , that Carter was seeking attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press . &quot;
the case has split the legal opinion .
&quot; to the few , the Carter belonged to Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 for murder on her British participation in Italy before she was acquitted for two years ago . &quot;
&quot; woman Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
&quot; Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich needed to be captain of the Audi Cup as captain , no coincidence . &quot;
the FC Bayern gives the Con@@ duc@@ ing Cup winner a great season - extra motivation behind it .
&quot; something was different from his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the extra garment piece was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , not Philipp L@@ m and did not see Manuel new one , he ha@@ sten@@ ed to the arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach did not send it , &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner was behind , after his first use as Bavaria captain . &quot;
&quot; good , the one could have better run as at 0 : 2 against SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
&quot; but the sign of the coach could , K@@ imm@@ ich , too . &quot;
&quot; not eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen out of youth players , de@@ but@@ ants , and just chosen out of the professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f but he was chosen as a guide . &quot;
sugar is best distributed to those who are to give a lot to those who want to keep in mood .
&quot; so , who was chosen to compete in Lah@@ m &apos;s inheritance , a little extra motivation can only use it well . &quot;
K@@ imm@@ ich &apos;s confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want to be considered to be a player : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was fl@@ att@@ ened as a mini @-@ lame on the field .
&quot; at the right side , this is now its position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich worked in this starting information such as the one , which can also take the ru@@ dder into the hand too . &quot;
he gave instructions to direct the un@@ noticed trou@@ pe .
&quot; he had a look at the whole , while many others were engaged in himself . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal to play his missing fitness ( fol@@ ks little ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus trying to link the devil &apos;s performance to the performance of Asia @-@ Travel ( it also worked only ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as are not neg@@ atively exp@@ ire in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ co@@ t . &quot;
all that worked out quite well .
&quot; Sü@@ le walked next to K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the defense , both stayed effort@@ lessly . &quot;
&quot; the renowned Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was very difficult , in addition , it was also trying to develop a few times in the play construction . &quot;
his colleague Rud@@ y gave the fact that the result was &quot; not as if we were hoping for us . &quot;
but he also showed a regular performance in the debut .
&quot; play transfer , temp@@ o change : &quot; I was also brought in for this style too . &quot;
&quot; like un@@ used , this Bavaria @-@ world is still available for re @-@ access , one saw in connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Rud@@ y did not have one or two , but certainly six or seven interviews . &quot;
K@@ imm@@ ich said after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements on his new co @-@ player back .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; what goes off here have I already noticed .
&quot; in Bavaria , you must simply win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he must not teach the new ones . &quot;

company happy with Rhineland @-@ p@@ fal@@ z@@ ic ministers : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings pace
&quot; often , the relationship between the country and the regional economy was often negle@@ cted , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still the Minister of Economy of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new economic minister Volker Wiss@@ ing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and t@@ ad@@ here at the same time the old female secretary .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ der Enterprise ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; knowing the wishes of the economy has blocked the wishes of the economy . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ er sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the bridge connection of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the priority list of the country .
&quot; this year , the Ministry for Planning is hop@@ ed for planning , to be the right to 2021 . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ ming Trier , which stands in the int@@ ru@@ sive need of the Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to take the tour in December 2020 , says Minister for Ministers Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
Nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post to support regional but internationally competing businesses .
&quot; the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier , as determined by knowledge , increased in the wine a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to boost sales in supermarkets and stop the trend for over ten years , to stop German wine exports . &quot;
&quot; in addition , knowledge have an open ear for people who want to establish a own company , pra@@ ises I@@ HK . &quot;

&quot; of 56 new engineers , who want to change knowledge at state @-@ operated mobility have so far been hal@@ ted only 29 places . &quot;
the I@@ HK required to award more orders to external offices .

Frank Nat@@ us also plans to solve a concept of the country as it wants to remedy skilled professionals in the region .

&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey with a score of 3.4 . &quot;

Audi should change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers are confron@@ ted with a counter@@ reaction . &quot;
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi , BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW @-@ President said that the company is that &quot; more intelligent options as driving limits , &quot; and thus based on European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to be able to limit or limit diesel engines . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Daimler announced that it was able to modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies described the company as a recall .
European car manufacturers have encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon emissions .
&quot; however , nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines , are regarded as carcin@@ o@@ gens , and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the costs for autom@@ akers , to install neutr@@ alisation of the neutr@@ alisation of the exhaust gases , also make it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to ignore the powerful auto@@ companies and ignore the signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies are trying to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called kill devices that have been tested to comply with regulations if a car was tested , but back in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were charged with Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be placed in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi , to have installed a system to deal with the emissions legislation in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the study could have heavily loaded Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer is di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately for the winning of Volkswagen .

un@@ dil@@ los v@@ ases and laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most widely published Carto@@ on Dra@@ fts@@ man who are the cre@@ ations of his figures .
even with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an Argent@@ ine@@ an artist is still working and working on a film .
&quot; his message : &quot; laughter , &quot; for there is too much sorrow in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 in the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires on 4 August 1932 .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he suggested himself among others as a sig@@ nat@@ ter for fortune cards by - which fru@@ str@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ iest day in my professional life was the day when she lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 1960s , the breakthrough of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines are around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
the artists of towns are always inspired again .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ ful mor@@ di@@ llo @-@ figures are cav@@ orting in drawings with the shooting Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; according to his own information , he is still living on the drawing day , almost ten hours each day . &quot;
&quot; about cal@@ endars , puzzles , books for Gross and Small , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and clo@@ cks continue to be much spread throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; since six years , he also works on a cartoon animation and a TV series with its figures . &quot;
&quot; the main character in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los , favourite animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as a counter@@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures for the first time in the 3D film will come to the movie screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say is indeed strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by it .
&quot; this is why he is rather foc@@ uss@@ ed on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced . &quot;
lavender out of Provence by climate change
&quot; he became a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; lavender is decl@@ ining due to the fore@@ d@@ rought conditions and due to the disease , that scientists and farmers trying to find solutions to find solutions , great heada@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the farm research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effective because the plant has been exposed to climate change in the past years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has impact on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lavender .
&quot; there is also a small z@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ aden transfers , and with very dry weather there is very many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; lavender oil attracts not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; instead of having a large number of flowers with a large number of flowers we have smaller , under@@ developed and either sm@@ iling or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; solutions that are considered to be considered , include a better water distribution and slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also spray plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dry . &quot;

the Ass@@ assin@@ ation of a journalist emphas@@ ises growing threat in Mexico
the assist@@ ants of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ ce usually meet on Wed@@ nes@@ days to check their plans for the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised civil servants and un@@ ce@@ able drug wars .
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
&quot; it was informed them , that it is important to change their rout@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which were the aim of aggression with gren@@ ades in 2009 , or leaving them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a plaque at the front of the room : opponent , neutral , allies . &quot;
&quot; please ask the reporter , propose a name for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdominal cav@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; drug ad@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of government or cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there are no rest @-@ break from violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are still more journalists : at least 25 , since then President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto passed his position in December 2012 . at least , there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , their publishers and their inspiration from Ri@@ o@@ ce , co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is deeply felt , though his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , that depic@@ ts his mid@@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , who sm@@ iling his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ anian . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the reporter discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , insom@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although At@@ tor@@ ney General in 2010 was established to process the cases of journalists , these according to the Committee to the Protection of journalists took only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of murders that are linked with drug dealers and organized crimes each year , the mur@@ derer will rarely be challenged by journalists . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ ce , they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a while they are un@@ break@@ able , even though the terrain is now sl@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting concerning the discussion of safety , I@@ bar@@ ra says . &quot;
&quot; it is very foolish , to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the Why , we susp@@ end all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ ce &apos;s office in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he just managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was arrested by two men . he was shot from his car and shot 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; 12th river . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left one wife and two adult children .
rum@@ ours incl@@ ined to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest during the past year and the extradition of the country in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the most blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ les@@ ions of the country , as rival fac@@ tions are strug@@ gling to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; there is nothing that is shot in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day or several people on the road , or that the cemetery is full of married , two @-@ story maus@@ ole@@ een for drug ro@@ omm@@ ates , which are bigger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget about a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest , &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , was the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival fac@@ tions in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this release may have off@@ ended the sons , presum@@ ed gear members bought each copy of the output as soon as they delivered to the newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez &apos;s mistake , after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper , which had published the same story , to leave the country to its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues took that he would always be there .
he served as an experienced journalist in 2003 when he sold himself with five colleagues to the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ ce and sold 50 U.S. dollar shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without off@@ end the d@@ ash of poison , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; at the time , the newspaper promised a call for cour@@ ageous and honest coverage , and sales and advertising . &quot;
reporter loved it to be able to publish hard tre@@ ach@@ ings without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication that could read stories that nobody else did to handle .
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in that same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists from the persecution of the Mexican drug history , where she always led them . &quot;
he gave up voluntarily to be afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said to the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug dealers in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October . &quot;
you need to take the job that as a journalist - either the or you play the dum@@ b .
I would not want to be asked : &quot; what did you do in the sight of many dead ... why did you not say what went before ?
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who , like a do@@ ck@@ workers , was able to curse the friend who was generous with h@@ ugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , going to sit there on the same table . &quot;
&quot; now , ask them : was his love for routine being cal@@ am@@ ity ? &quot;
&quot; his death also forced them to ask her own involvement in question , as they can do their work at the best and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it , if you encounter with their wives , their children , their little stores , their home starting and run@@ ways , to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ c@@ ens@@ orship and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ ct .
&quot; when it smells wr@@ ong@@ ly , stay away . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the publisher of the Ri@@ o@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the matter is happening with Javier . &quot;
&quot; the ancient rules , as he and others say , will not apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a , as well as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative dirt , weak institutions and corrupt government officials . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room where the employees of Ri@@ o@@ ce met for security training , there were suddenly no cell phones allowed . days earlier , Spy@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments and used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
two polic@@ emen were seeking protection outside the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an area .
&quot; half in joke , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether this Offic@@ ers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who described the governor himself as non @-@ tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the reporter went into the mountain landscape , where the drug con@@ glomer@@ ates de facto is under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ ce added three main stories .
there were the murder of the former known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é to the State Duma , focused on the hom@@ etown of the governor . &quot;
&quot; there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about what was kidnapped or as it happened , so caution was commanded when it was time to write , what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place of local drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a reporter learned from public notes that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician , who ruled the ruling Instit@@ utes Party Party ( PR@@ I ) which ruled the entire century all political levels . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ quality cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the reporter concerning previous incid@@ ents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man passed a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez &apos;s readers have considered the best informed source of the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we would have known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stick@@ ers , to protest against the killing of journalists , because the employees have become something that they would never expect : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
reporter Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez shooting a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning due to another journalist for the office of the Prosecutor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials , based on DNA tests that it is its . &quot;
journalists have become stronger throughout the country by having written in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on walking routes and buildings .
this day is the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
&quot; at a meeting with Governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez acc@@ use the authorities to give journalists and kill them because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; it has since then asked that it is sub@@ divided by the government , because she is worried that their anger has hurt their objec@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organizing crimes , involved in government officials and a valid society . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that reporter could not only be killed by drug laws , but also on orders of politicians and security forces with organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you die , because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the kill@@ ings have a terrible effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as at the northern boundary of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found together with a note , which was supposedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern boundary of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo following the assassination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug box with a leading article on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home country or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and seek haz@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as evi@@ den@@ ced by the photographer Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was apparently assassin@@ ated with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who continue to stay and continue working , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ free decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be poets , gives the drug dealers frigh@@ ten him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became Rep@@ orters , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ ce sat down on the side@@ walk before the office and drinking beer , when all their teleph@@ ones began to sum@@ ming up . &quot;
a series of sh@@ anks with band@@ aging and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan bath@@ house had 19 confirmed dead .
&quot; the war continued , as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell em@@ bassies in the region . &quot;
&quot; from the Bord@@ aber@@ ries , they have published news on the web site of Ri@@ o@@ ce via mobile . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens close up - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept guard to see if they were put into read@@ iness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; among the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ o@@ ce followed its tracks . &quot;
&quot; as you can only think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when she was murdered on the same day when Javier was assassin@@ ated , she asked for reporting to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used to avoid his enemies .
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , although a sc@@ ary . &quot;
researchers have found that the first findings of an unbelievable rhin@@ oc@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so well preserved that experts have described it as a &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well preserved that they could even realize that his sli@@ pp@@ le skin was brown - and they said she would have had something from a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the uphol@@ stered din@@ osau@@ rs , who ever has been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
&quot; the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved state has researchers , who described it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the arm@@ oured plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best known F@@ ossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Shawn Funk , when he had dug in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something which appeared from the surrounding rocks at the plateau , and decided to be more precise . &quot;
the F@@ ossil discovered by him was sent into the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal in the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth@@ en@@ nia . &quot;
&quot; after all these hard work , the ready result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you have blin@@ king only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ rell Museum where the creation is visible . &quot;
it will go to the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - the mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; researchers found out that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although covered with a arm@@ or , resem@@ bles a convertible breast@@ plate , probably from meat car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide , and used a par@@ atro@@ opers that is known as counter @-@ att@@ ening , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to mix well in his surroundings , to spread its enemies , say experts , which indicates that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million year old creation from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now in the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers now studied the wild animal and called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum techniques Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7.000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the astonishing preser@@ vation of a single specimen enabled it to document the Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of shed and arm@@ aments about his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the p@@ atter@@ ing , a widespread defence method in animal rich , which means that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than their base . &quot;
&quot; although the accounts are custom@@ ary , the results are unexpected , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ ared from sufficient pressure by the ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution of the con@@ frontation was benef@@ ited as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that apply the counter @-@ sha@@ ding - think of Re@@ he , Zeb@@ ras or gir@@ d@@ ules - are much smaller and inj@@ uri@@ ous as spo@@ ils , what signals that this No@@ dos@@ cope was exposed to a true struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or @-@ behavior on a massive , strong ar@@ du@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ stu@@ ffed must have been &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ wer was red@@ dish .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life , including his ser@@ ene Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it had eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , came into a river and brought forth into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alberta was as warm as South @-@ sea today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ ven@@ ed skin , but also kept in three dimensions and ret@@ ains the original form of the beast , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost as much as in the early cra@@ yon period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use so much imagination to re@@ design it . if you only have a little with the eyes Sch@@ iel@@ en , you could almost believe that he is on sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when giant ther@@ op@@ o@@ des , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that stood on two legs , the earth passed through . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus Rex , lived million years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was lost in the sea after the death in the sea . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Shawn Funk , when he had dug in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the uphol@@ stered din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to the hips . &quot;
&quot; the creatures had an average of about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant @-@ e@@ aters was sw@@ amped through Western Canada by a flooded river into the open sea .
&quot; however , the underwater exploration of the din@@ osau@@ r keep his arm@@ our in exquisite detail . &quot;
&quot; the remains of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the legs still cover hol@@ pri@@ zed plastic plates along the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preser@@ vation is as rarely as a l@@ otto . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more confused it will be . &quot;
&quot; hidden parts of the skin still cover the hol@@ pri@@ zed plastic plates , which wear the skull of animal . &quot;
&quot; his right front foot sits on his side , his five fingers are split up . &quot;
I can count the she@@ ds at his sole .
in the storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age in A8 : many injured
severe accident on Thursday night at the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass @-@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , miles long st@@ ems - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
on the outskirts of Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) on the late Thursday afternoon there were about 20 people injured in the morning of Thursday .
&quot; after the first indications of the police were against 17.00 between the connecting hall of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , just under 30 vehicles , including trucks . &quot;
over the exact number of injured persons initially no data is present .
&quot; it is a slight until moderate injuries , said a polic@@ eman . &quot;
a large offer of ambul@@ ance aircraft was on the accident .
the A8 was completely blocked in Munich .
&quot; in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometer long retreat was formed . &quot;
like a AZ rep@@ orters , it also occurred on the road@@ way to massive disabilities - by numerous g@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the brig@@ ade also not@@ ched the license plates of the vehicle len@@ ders who now have to calculate with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , there was a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
thereby it was a coll@@ ision between a car supp@@ orter and a passenger car .
a b@@ ail@@ out helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; it is a moment that almost every one has experienced already : nothing , one sits on the train and sleeps . &quot;
or man is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ets .
&quot; come the rh@@ et@@ ner , and we@@ aken an uns@@ hi@@ ft or ri@@ ps the road in the heart of the workflow . &quot;
ticket control .
but the times of breaks are soon passed .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the most expensive ticket control .
&quot; they are simply confirmed by phone , that the ticket may be taken , and thereby re@@ iter@@ ates the ticket . &quot;
at present a test run runs on two tracks .
&quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of the year , on many other remote locations in Germany . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in , calls the train to the ticket de@@ valuation without any rh@@ et@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; to use these , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what to do in most passengers already .
&quot; it is also necessary to have purchased via the app of the rail , DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of the ticket booking . &quot;
and last you need a seat reservation .
&quot; the &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; works as follows : if you go to the train , the ticket call &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the test customers , a button on electronic de@@ valuation appears . &quot;
the enco@@ ders get a message on their mobile devices that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is in the train and took the booked seat Y .
&quot; when the ticket control comes at room Y , he knows that there is a passenger with a value @-@ off online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the railway - which is to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; whoever wishes to travel without a ticket control through our access staff , check out in the DB Navigator . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to create their travel time in turn personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing management board of DB correspondence . &quot;
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than to go to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those often goes by train , knows that addition to del@@ ays and pas@@ sports , the ticket controls are among the greatest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for often , in any case , one of the fellow travelers did not need all documents that are needed to de@@ valuation online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document that is to be presented .
&quot; the result are endless discussions between train conductor and driving g@@ ast , which leads to poor mood in part or large space and del@@ ays in control of your own tickets and takes the train at the end of time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
even a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is also only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE : Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional access numbers on the same route are not available yet .
how a activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to their core .
&quot; just one day after she had arrived in New York City , the St. Louis prayer was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and sc@@ roll@@ ed by Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from High School .
&quot; the police killed just a 18 year old child , and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; it was called there . &quot;
&quot; confused when nobody had posted the information on their feed , she finished Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was continually prayed on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was part of the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old man who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he post@@ ete a picture of Brown &apos;s le@@ aded body that was stretched out on the road and would stay there four hours .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; Fer@@ rell thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
&quot; she put her mobile phone off , in order to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive in the evening . &quot;
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed at which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a rebellious dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , a different polic@@ eman made his gun and shou@@ ted : &quot; I will kill you all . &quot;
&quot; that is not common , Fer@@ rell remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ ust@@ omed and which we can call it typically .
&quot; in this moment , I felt ch@@ ills . &quot;
I was mad and wept . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , her 6 year old daughter won her father &apos;s 6 year old daughter and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , of love and losses , of strength and strength , which consists of the point of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell , with her daughter , wore a floral dress and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , she had a discussion that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; they remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t true . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her away , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be mounted in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vism and organization , but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution , and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have good luck , you experience an experience in which she personally identi@@ fies no ek@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is not unlike the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I feel like that , I would prove their bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first stop , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police agency which was waiting for a camping area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ indictment by Offic@@ ers Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined with a local business partner . &quot;
they prepared bags before and helped to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of acti@@ vism began to accept for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; after 9 August , my acti@@ vism has changed totally , &quot; &quot; she said and not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ ur@@ ses Association , and focused on essay justice and health ine@@ qualities in black congregations . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience at organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r wanted only to document &quot; what happened . &quot;
a question came to Fer@@ rell : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can explo@@ it ?
&quot; this scep@@ tic@@ ism was nourished by countless cases of people , often of white - in a community that prof@@ ited from their pain and their resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently said in an interview , &quot; We have heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to make it different . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for its acti@@ vism around death . &quot;
&quot; his commitment to Fer@@ rell brought the project closer together , along with six other domestic people followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; during the years after Bro@@ wns . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we speak , &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are depicted , because so I will be presented . &quot;
&quot; the aim was to concentrate on Fer@@ rell@@ s &apos;s experience - to show that it is a &quot; &quot; Messiah &quot; &quot; leader but for a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprising personal aspects of Fer@@ rell@@ s &apos;s life , as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laughed , when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I understood that there must be a certain danger during this work , and with the expression of black men . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rell@@ s &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are strug@@ gling with different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay men must carry the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; follow Fol@@ ay@@ an , not@@ ing that &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence , although she was in front of the front , because at one life on these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman is so much in the game . &quot;
you can sense its energy through the screen .
&quot; in the meantime , news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the r@@ attle connections between the community and the police continue . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; she describes the social atmosphere of the area , called her home : &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless she kl@@ es herself to a singing and she feels committed to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on to the street three years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; The size of &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss the bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit Gallery moves people , although it is still not built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre on the southern zone of the pedestrian prec@@ eded by the people in favour of pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation 2009 .
cold the subject is hardly a cold .
on our Facebook page &quot; People and Bit@@ burg &quot; the subject is discussed .
&quot; while the one to say to the bit Gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; it would be genuine &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Show@@ case ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; no man &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi bass ) or simply : &quot; &quot; size &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates are building that a gallery attracts more customers in the city , including the rest of the other businesses , fear the enemy that then bleeding the pedestrian zone . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned on the property , on which the peas@@ ant market stands in which 13 direct distribution boxes can offer their products . &quot;
construction work will conclude with the start of construction .
&quot; the gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and , for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with the possibility to sit outside . &quot;
Simone Rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost weekly in the farm brand for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm are always happy again . &quot;
the but@@ cher we discovered for us too .
we would like to maintain that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
there is also that in other cities .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market in a market hall in the gallery comes up at the height of the rent .
&quot; however , this is likely to be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what are the shops in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothes , shoes , thr@@ ott@@ le or supermarkets : I find the superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough in our city .
one sees how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least us will remain the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered here is fresh , mostly offered by the product , and is inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shop shops are rented in a shopping mall only by larger firms , because the mit@@ es are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special stores there is almost no longer and what is left of it , will probably still disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall will not fit me together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where should the peas@@ ant mark during the construction time ?
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ KA would be the solution - even on duration , when the bit Gallery is actually coming . &quot;
or does it already make the ghost bit Gallery to distribute all the shops of Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that is simply not functioning .
&quot; and shopping center that stands empty , nobody needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real estate market place , instead of this gallery . &quot;
but there is no place for a peas@@ ant park . just like I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more .
&quot; when the peas@@ ant market st@@ utt@@ ings are made , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a perfect simil@@ arity : artist creates portrait of Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown that almost im@@ perc@@ ep@@ tible like that of the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ res and Haar@@ lem , who were sent to Chelsea Mann@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analysts took a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she publicly acknowledged diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks site . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , its discipline , united in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and a pioneering dis@@ sid@@ y , was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his ministry . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg created the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA , created by Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , such as somebody could not only look at the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways , as they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Bradley Edward , has been spoken openly about the identification as a woman , was convicted of 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the sp@@ ying act , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; the prison was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is intenti@@ onally sitting on a driver seat and a platinum blonde Per@@ ig is associated with them . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist portraits of strangers made from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette st@@ ling and che@@ wing gum , extra@@ cting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what these people might look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they brought an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use were attributed to un@@ painted letters that had several letters in the course of two years .
&quot; she even created a comic comic opera &quot; Supp@@ lied Images , &quot; which was predicted to convert a future in which the president of Chel@@ ep@@ ist@@ le would be able to view the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Obama actually only had few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ers release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of happ@@ ier meetings . &quot;
&quot; there is also the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camps and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ aked ways to fix the rigid columns that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after the wei@@ rd timing of all of these things , she said that &quot; things happen in a specific reason . &quot;
&quot; in a well @-@ written artistic statement , Mann@@ ing called for Mann@@ ing with their super@@ script among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their sur@@ name ) is an end of the &quot; automatic disin@@ formation , whose foundation is gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed to show involving the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the advanced scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people hopefully will take away is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective her are , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
DNA data can tell so many different stories so these are 30 of these stories .
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic @-@ Nov@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; she shows Mann@@ ing , as she appears with a release @-@ free hand in the hand of the disciplines of the United States , as King @-@ Hong Kong . &quot;
&quot; if they put your speech in cold , then they have won . &quot;
&quot; so never leave the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
I always get ge@@ ese when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if they should do it , it will be greeted by their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ak@@ ras , like hor@@ des of protest@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; it was also targeted as everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , with which their genetic Hap@@ ag was written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , that formed themselves with Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
&quot; a nationwide human @-@ hunt is going on for a professor at North@@ western University and a employee of Oxford University , which had been visited as susp@@ ects , after a man had been caught in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , the Court issued by W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder of his alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as the acts of the Amts@@ gericht of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several sticks . &quot;
a private warning system published by the Chicago police authority in Chicago states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
&quot; officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found victim of several injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared the event of the event for dead , and det@@ ective investig@@ ating the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police searched after the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
L@@ ath@@ em has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , vice president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that L@@ ath@@ em was now being mist@@ aken and excluded from the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter which is studied by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the university and the Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation that &quot; we are in touch with the police in Great Britain , and ready to help U.S. investig@@ ators in any imagin@@ able manner . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleague were sho@@ cked and wanted to set himself .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he demands the susp@@ ect to place the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has an idea of their position , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local and national and national agencies are helping to find the susp@@ ects .
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received a mysterious tip , said that in apartment 10@@ 08 something happened . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the Grand Plaza management team released a statement to the residents : &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the victim , and explo@@ res a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian vice @-@ president Mut@@ ko
the Russian vice @-@ president Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for restoration of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a specific stage , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA &apos;s ful@@ fill@@ ment has the right to plan and test them in collaboration with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA tim@@ etable has been updated in this regard , &quot; Mut@@ ko declared on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the Code which describes the criteria for re@@ inst@@ igation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA , and recently published on the organisation &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he contains nothing that could give an opportunity for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list mentioned is that the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities decided to accept the reported results from the WA@@ DA approved investigation by the Canadian attor@@ ney Richard McLaren to alleged government @-@ sponsored D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we conduct the investigation as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not give something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ k@@ os words voted by Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales station R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organisations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report should be controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody asked to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from WA@@ DA by implementing D@@ oping control in Russia .
&quot; it was allowed , however , to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the main theme of the Organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Olivier Nig@@ gl@@ i stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving &quot; into the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di only sells eggs more
both shared the company groups .
&quot; it &apos;s a pure precau@@ tionary measure , it could continue to be assumed by any health impair@@ ment , it was named in the Communication . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs alone can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been demonstr@@ ably tested negative on the pro@@ ver@@ itable anti @-@ les@@ ions . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency to his customers .
&quot; start ups , that will help your company , will not become the next U@@ ber &quot;
Amy Survi@@ ve wanted to compete in your employee &apos;s happiness at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the p@@ olls did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague too little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently .
&quot; and even if she promised An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not believe in the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; said deliver@@ t who manages the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed . &quot;
she called people from outside around help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is at the wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct staff surveys , Special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to handle the C @-@ suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used to measure staff . &quot;
&quot; who told them , that she won a better view into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the s@@ nap @-@ p@@ olls and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low condition results , so you can re@@ boot why . &quot;
&quot; companies are coming to seeing that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , who describes a blog post in Sk@@ and@@ als , who have been speaking of har@@ ass@@ ment in those who have spoken . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups , such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility . &quot;
&quot; the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the financial technical site let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Denver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent evil behavior and to recognize , saw an asc@@ ending interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla . &quot;
u@@ ber was recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent company leaves companies tail@@ or @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confi@@ dential responses in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line to report with employees in bad behavior .
&quot; and when the main business leaders is involved , compl@@ aining complaints directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that his staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated or in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience co@@ stly consequences due to consumers boy@@ cott , workers fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Conver@@ cent has deployed for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have an easy way to have their company headquarters . &quot;
&quot; sooner if an employee wished to report a problem , he had to submit a telephone number or e @-@ mail to the company &apos;s headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said it was not a good way to follow the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company Conver@@ cent reli@@ es , problems the previously identified by executives that sat down in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or irregular practices , have been identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can take closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view in the experience of employment &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we are protecting our shareholders before employment and lit@@ igation . &quot;
&quot; in 2002 , ethics , values and staff of employees began to take part in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen , due to ethical deteri@@ oration through the Enron sc@@ andal , Quin@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media &quot; came to their right &quot; that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty work online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor the ethics , people used to be used as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as service , and ass@@ els the companies with recur@@ ring charges for use of their products . &quot;
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start@@ ups .
&quot; in February , Conver@@ t received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital to raise the whole capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , showing that today &apos;s employees expect more than ever . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only inser@@ ts . &quot;
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that makes their voices , and that the work that you do is worth , then feel more strongly committed to make this company successful , and said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In which both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors arrive at R@@ end@@ iten when their portfolio company run well . businesses are running well when employees are working and engaged .
&quot; if the Analytics tools promise third parties to increase commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data about employee involvement after the experts of the workplace culture is important .
&quot; but the data are us@@ eless , if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company does not take action . &quot;
&quot; in fact , if a company asks employees to your feedback , it may have expect@@ ation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if change is not fast enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appointments and employees can motiv@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , which has seen themselves to rely on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you don &apos;t follow the staff , &quot; Hab@@ t you really heard me ? &quot; &quot;
do you care for this ?
&quot; and if you do not care about that , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Madison Reed , who passes the monthly p@@ olls now , was able to direct action on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , saving it . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organize again by the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable to re @-@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; in Ruby Tuesday , the company receives new insights over the employees , and it hopes that for a long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is well @-@ known for high sales . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose your company . &quot;
the N@@ CAA solves the two @-@ day practice and makes a long day for the brood @-@ ins
&quot; it &apos;s about 23 watch , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A football player are talking on one side of the new training fields of the teams on the campus . &quot;
some have moved their tri@@ cot@@ ic parts and show the back of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team there is a lunch break .
&quot; players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return after the three hour exercise , before they return next morning at 6 : 30 a.m. to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real pedal mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; N@@ CAA eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and she has actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 will begin to meet the players already fully packed . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , where the brood moved to the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the Summer School for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
they are to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of the formal playing preparations for their lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said he supports the rule change of N@@ CAA supported , even if they add a further point to the number of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put these enormous loads three or four days on it , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it , they plac@@ ements up , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; as soon as we come to Saturday , and we &apos;ll have more time , it will really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practice as soon as the rest is finished , in view of the clear sight of its fields , from a adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Lus@@ kin centre , a hotel of the elevated class , which is already covered with foot@@ balls , which will be no easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people would rent a room and then set up there to record a practice . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces in parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry about too big concerns .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy the facts review in the fight against fake messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential items with counter@@ feit detection of third parties and their results below the original fee , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated teaching methods to detect possible detection applications , and to send them to fac@@ tor@@ ment verification , which may indicate results of the fact evaluation from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main focus points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which believe that they have also influenced the United States presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded during the presidential election in May with false stories , and Germany should not succeed in order to eliminate social media networks as before the elections in September quickly . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook , Facebook said in a separate explanation in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will be a test of new facts review . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge that stories of fac@@ ten@@ ac@@ ups should be foc@@ uss@@ ed by third parties , people want to make more context what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
&quot; it added that Facebook continues to continue its feature to the &quot; &quot; associated article &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to its news feed , to decrease false news . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle in a sque@@ eze @-@ music video was to see and was a conclusion for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced a turbul@@ ent history of 700 years of turbul@@ ent history in the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent , now is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historic documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of somebody who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; says he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England , spann@@ ed the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac steering ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , which is based on a archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the Dau@@ men@@ ab@@ druck on the side of a letter , which was written by a double agents in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; that is his thum@@ b print !
&quot; and letters still smell of smoke , because then a fire was lit for light because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect as he himself would . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is sm@@ itten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council in England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest &quot; ) it seems too beautiful to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ dos spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ arch@@ ers of the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with land care , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only given its full access in 2006 when the final Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; as Rhodes a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ oc@@ rates said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English emp@@ ires , maps , depicting what possessed &quot; &quot; I could mean that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought for two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let everything go through ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to go on a wider basis in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to close to the peas@@ ant stand of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book titled &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the peas@@ ant stand in this area and I thought , an insur@@ rection is a good start . &quot;
perhaps they are connected with each other ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are ro@@ oted in the history of the castle , such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it Pat@@ tern that the family Dar@@ rell hid seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , in which sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell , portra@@ yed out of the 18th century , filled his own funeral by having made a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was only dug for years later ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rell@@ s are Rhodes &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the masters seemed to be a great gig , always make debts and spend money , which they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; for other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men , their debt crises , giving them rich old women , I put them to myself as a he@@ ap of looking guys , with a talent to recru@@ it land@@ locked . &quot;
after the end of his approach in the castle Rhodes in search of other unique write @-@ experiences
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ sh@@ ame@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been returned from nature again . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
&quot; campaign started : more than 300 years old , Mari@@ bl@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf region &quot;
&quot; with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mary chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team to keep Nelson Art@@ z &apos;s logo and their slogan . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , there will be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; asking the makers of action since yesterday in posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) do not really , write them on their yesterday website . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we know a bad Hon@@ ne@@ on citizen for beauty and attraction of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; in action , there is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , meaning it continues . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique imagination . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a mean five @-@ digit amount can be reached by the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f for its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the Army
&quot; every year , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es on reti@@ re@@ els and convey@@ ors abroad . &quot;
so also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is a routine for the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the session no longer took place in the building of the general staff , as previously , but in the minister &apos;s office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the government , five vice @-@ vice @-@ lab@@ s , as well as the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
thereby the civilians were killed in the Y@@ as .
the government re@@ mov@@ eth the bre@@ eder in the military .
&quot; Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the Com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were removed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , Mr. Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ miral . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of exile @-@ pre@@ ach@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ülen , Erdo@@ gan is a wire @-@ driver of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people , who are directly involved in the coup attempt to have been involved in Ankara following this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; as he wanted to give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot;
but did Erdo@@ gan really have the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ be@@ hagen &quot; in the military headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the general staff , there is concerns about increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army which mani@@ f@@ ests itself among others in the lifting of the head@@ band for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the big clean@@ up in the army and security forces continued . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan sent a further 73@@ 95 State operator , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 546 soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it seemed , when Erdo@@ gan was t@@ amed the military . &quot;
gener@@ als were earlier than the actual lords of the country .
&quot; in three times , they embar@@ ked on their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world@@ ly State Order . &quot;
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan was the power of the military step back , not least among calling on the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is managing an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; an officer called for the &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; magazine , who was searching for a coup attempt to pursue persecution from persecution of foreign policy , the Turkish army will be in a few years full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; if this is too late , NATO could not leave Nato cool . &quot;
&quot; anyway , there is an alliance to pur@@ ge doubts about the use of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities were &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the Green Card rules
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees the legal immig@@ rant to 50,000 per year , more str@@ ingent regulations for the maintenance of visa for temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented Visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed under the Con@@ gresses in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and billions of dollars for the tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the USA will change the way to citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new applicant procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot;
Ministry I want to give the race track shuttle
&quot; over the past few months , over the future of the racing Cast@@ les , it was fought very quickly . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , the tourist circuit is expected to be constructed on the tourist circuit . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the racing bikes in the long term , according to data from the Federal Ministry , construction work will begin on the route . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to continue to order and san@@ iti@@ ze the route Il@@ men@@ au racing platform and to renov@@ ate the country , the State Secretary of State Klaus S@@ ühl was on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route he moved to about 2.5 million euros .
this sum trans@@ gress the country 75 percent .
&quot; the treaty , based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will definitely be coordinated , declared S@@ ühl . &quot;
the Department and the South @-@ ür@@ ingen train as operators are already aware of the technical details .
&quot; thus , the tim@@ etable and quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ ühl . &quot;
the planned agreement between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
that should be ordered regular scheduled for the racing platform on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ gate Shuttle is one of all the popular train connections between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ gate .
&quot; over the past few months , the course of a pilot project had been tested , whether the distance of sufficiently many people is used to order to order it again in the future . &quot;
the circuit is also heavily poll@@ uted in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t be cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robot . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a great deal .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor for Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start to take their ascent seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of ni@@ p@@ ples and type of finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the company deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key said in the release of his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon ing@@ ival tissue that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can adapt its robot accordingly to its beliefs &quot; &quot; and select everything , from the eye colour of the robot into the form of ni@@ p@@ ples until the type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; but there is still wor@@ r@@ ying , as many robots possess the &quot; personalities &quot; which would look a Step@@ ford @-@ woman progressive . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed into robots with a silicon ing@@ ival tissue .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot makes it possible for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties they are appe@@ aling as an in@@ sist@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; and then there &apos;s the fact that Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ Robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of rel@@ ent@@ iness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that has been adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; obli@@ que the site of true companion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you like , etc . &quot;
&quot; during the day , she also has their m@@ oods - quite like real people ! &quot;
&quot; you can be tired , being fixed to conversation or she can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many wor@@ r@@ ying aspects on this ascent of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the lowest level of relationships , the play@@ grounds on rape , when you get a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( say : oppos@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , wor@@ ries one of the most . &quot;
&quot; true on his website , true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it &apos;s on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fet@@ ish or just another sex toys . &quot;
&quot; their origin and its increasing refin@@ ement point in a little dar@@ ker and low depth in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes towards a wish to sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men do not have a sex robot , and while the FR@@ R not@@ ices its increasing popularity , however , they remain provision@@ ally on the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but which le@@ ak@@ ages from the Rand@@ om zones , can be very instruc@@ tive in regards to the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or offensive , until they have free the free market for this . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , a certain over@@ lap that this highly developed sex robot in a time sc@@ uba diving in which the rights of women are threatened with women in which the White House has a pre@@ sidents who pra@@ ises to have women sexually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the most terrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the ma@@ id@@ servant &apos; ) are not the graphical pictures , the swallowed body , and the out@@ stretched eyes , but how real@@ ist@@ ically this vision seems . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump . &quot;
the aim behind this sex robot is to create a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( even though with Por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
&quot; their genetic builders want to feel human@@ kind , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; however , to the point when it goes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; robots represent no real women . &quot;
you can not separate or go away from her companion .
&quot; they have no medi@@ ation or background history , nothing , which indicates independence or anything , to distur@@ b the imagination of the imagination . &quot;
different expressed : they are counter@@ feit slaves .
&quot; or , to express it in the Rede@@ mp@@ se of 2017 : maid service &quot;
tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney about the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human lives
&quot; it has become a binary @-@ era of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that have the political columns that have the US weigh@@ ted sensor , can also split families in a small format . &quot;
around Christmas and harvest festival there were newspapers in the US newspapers with advice on how to circum@@ vent with the horror of p@@ umping .
we are all supposed to be placed in order to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families has been less noticed . &quot;
&quot; I consider this because my cousin , an left @-@ directed poet that lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she remin@@ ded me that the unit may have a mighty effect against a common enemy .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can transformation , with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left hand was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the effective effect of its presidency has the power to move us to the right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ assy possibility that our cookies will no longer be put to us . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a sc@@ ary long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to his standards as a ep@@ it@@ ome of failure . &quot;
&quot; I found myself from active nostal@@ gia to Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of the back@@ yard - the dog on the car &apos;s shelter , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - which occur both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump comes , the next candidate of rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as a measur@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; as my cousin in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ us@@ el in the New York park department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ isp@@ y and the animals rotate to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the k@@ lim@@ per@@ ing music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : views of high buildings become old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to provide a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not all over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage , but a large round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , since two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could assess the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given to him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale ranging from one to five stars before I passed my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in coffee house on the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to hire an average rating of 15 % - this to buy something about the shop . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation that is not required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store stood exc@@ essively gr@@ ati@@ fying , while I tired the experience you made my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from the prison to hospital
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us leave the prison for the second time . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of liqu@@ or to the hospital , which he suffered from prison authorities according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder of prosec@@ ut@@ ors for murder following an appeal of prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
&quot; he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of the Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 , taking them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pre@@ toria on her . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal penetration that was hidden in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell in which they say it was too sigh@@ ted .
&quot; the national law en@@ forcement authority said that they will be up in the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objec@@ tion could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold is a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the flower schools , the four @-@ t@@ ec@@ kl@@ ets from F@@ üt@@ zen and Ep@@ fen@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students have to go to high school , four at the secondary school . &quot;
school leader Angel@@ ika S@@ itte greeted parents and representatives from the public at the civil house Bi@@ es@@ ental in Ep@@ fen@@ ho@@ fen .
&quot; the 29 pupils of the four classes chose the four classes under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eag@@ les that grows in the chicken yard , but then freed in freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ ite Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle of the chicken yard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chicken . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken shed , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope to make out of him a chicken , the eagle spread abroad on a high mountain of his wings , and ent@@ s@@ ware . &quot;
afterwards the classes were three and four in the study of Y@@ v@@ onne Frank a chicken .
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder contributed to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Adler stand for integration , said School director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young was different than the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
they desired every four @-@ day cl@@ ut@@ ters that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; it was followed by Dank@@ es@@ word to the colleague , the former school@@ master Michael Mu@@ eller , who starts again at class courses , and the parents advoc@@ ate . &quot;
the Ku@@ ken@@ ing was over now ; the class teacher Sophia Schumacher announced .
&quot; after two years of lessons , they only leave the lessons , because it had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , she is able to rely on the four @-@ door spre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; finally , every student could sound a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
&quot; with the children , great joy broke out . &quot;
eight first @-@ ups have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were detained for illegal Camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 1 August in Si@@ th@@ onia , a group of illegal tents was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while currently an investigation runs . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have intensi@@ fied control of the free camp@@ ans and lay down anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , which is not responsible for that purpose . &quot;
controls are continued during the whole season .
the ministry said that the court can hang a fine .
software update for diesel cars : what those affected are to know now
how accurate is the software update ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
&quot; with the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group are offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
&quot; they are to improve emission behavior of cars of emission classes Euro 5 , and some Euro 6 . &quot;
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
&quot; An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin , from the ACE Auto Club Europe , is available for ass@@ essments : &quot;
is the new action oblig@@ atory ?
&quot; no , the updated software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates before they only apply to the vehicles presented by Schumann , &quot; An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the retro@@ fitting has ordered the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
manufacturers already announced an exact appointment in the coming months but still no precise date .
Daimler has shown to write everyone involved .
&quot; if I &apos;m moving in an inspection , this will be done in their frame . &quot;
how long will the equipment move around ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ al@@ anine says . &quot;
&quot; the hang@@ ings of the manufacturer &apos;s commitment , as well as from political pressure . &quot;
&quot; because we have seen , voluntarily negoti@@ ate the automobile manufacturers at the subject of environment so far . &quot;
how long shall the update last ?
the re@@ armament itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming could it be to receive an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers , who don &apos;t drive car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ? &quot;
the ACE says to wait .
&quot; presumably , foreign manufacturers would consider , such as S@@ met@@ al@@ anine . &quot;
is there a massive price drop in Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but just in the regions where drivers are dro@@ pping .
&quot; in rural areas , there is no loss of losses for older diesel . &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es to wait with a sale yet .

we make the city vibrant
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s city master , goes to retirement in the coming year . &quot;
the place is already written - suitable applicant are rare .
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker &apos;s master builders . &quot;
and work is still great fun as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
&quot; it reports varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his success@@ ors . &quot;
at the same time it amaz@@ es that no application provides the requirement profile .
the city is looking for the next possible time a architects or engineer .
&quot; thus , for the contemp@@ t of regular canc@@ ers - yet enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach was active for the administrative community as a lower building authority , the applicant must indicate the respective depar@@ tures . &quot;
because this function plans to keep the town definitely .
&quot; if they could not fill out this , they would have to travel to Offen@@ burg on consultation until Offen@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; but the city is near to the city and it itself is important , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good operating climate as well as good senti@@ ment between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back to the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city lively , &quot; he is safe with the Bau@@ amt and his staff . &quot;
&quot; but in the future , varied projects are focused on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ cl@@ a Are@@ as and the parking space of the Lower Hu@@ cl@@ a areas . &quot;
&quot; the chin @-@ bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone sp@@ ells some 1.5 million euros alone , &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; designed for a city master , great play @-@ space is present . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s private construction yard and gar@@ dening , it could be flexi@@ bly re@@ acted on many things . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; so w@@ ack@@ ers , and the shap@@ ing of green plants will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town is located under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to do that which adap@@ ts &quot; when new@@ builds are approved , st@@ resses the new city master . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the city master carries high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a client , &quot; at the end , everything runs on my table . &quot;
&quot; for years and coordination , he can count on many many years : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been with Manfred Schön@@ es ( civil engineering ) for over 15 years . &quot;

bicycle on the pipes : southern route closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway station in the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were so strongly damaged that the coming in freight train had to be maintained .
investig@@ ators go from two male trav@@ ellers and seek them for the night hours after them .
&quot; near the crime scene , a ro@@ sar@@ er roller and a bicycle driver were observed from witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz region , &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot;
the or the perpet@@ rators would have brought themselves in great danger and vulnerable to the train .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the L@@ ok and the plant , as well as the delay @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail transport could also come to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; in total , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damage were returned on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be guided without disability . &quot;
&quot; Friday afternoon , two of them were watching the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; goods are not taken out , however , they had delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ö@@ BB speaker , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged about 200 meters of upper pipes . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat and dairy products and chocolate could help relie@@ ve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study asser@@ ts the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could relie@@ ve symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000 , causing stomach cr@@ amps and ble@@ aching , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhoea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while the affected will usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University finds that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that enhance a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that immun@@ o cells in the intest@@ ine is pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , hiding in the eating , not in the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to destroy inflammation , are compens@@ ated by cells that protect tolerance and protect the body , without damage the body . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it is caused by an inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; in experim@@ enting , revealed that a kind of tolerance boo@@ sting immune cell occurs in mice , which carry a particular bacter@@ ium in their ent@@ rails . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacteria type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han used the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich nutrition can toler@@ ate , less inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases , if the same system is in people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctoral degree in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cells that promotes tolerance , but found that a group of study arms such cells had , but another group of the same tribe , which was separately accommod@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it thought that the difference was to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ al of mice , the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gast@@ ro @-@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; mice of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced , and there were six types of bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were mounted in a ster@@ il@@ ene environment , so that they were lacking a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers investigated L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then led to small amounts of liquid - without bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; the active component of the liquid has been cleaned , it proved to be a minor product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ met@@ abolic ism , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the mice , the number of these cells increased by around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan said that people have the same toler@@ ant cells like mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect us in our gast@@ ro @-@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i found the cells in people as in mice but defects in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose Mour@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; in Manchester United States signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , on Wednesday evening Jose Mour@@ in@@ ho believes his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the Chelsea Po@@ und in Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre@@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday and impressive in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the pre @-@ Prepar@@ ation Asia tour and managed only 45 minutes to improve the Mour@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he takes time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; said Mour@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be ready later than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic started Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va stadium , Mour@@ in@@ ho made its start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed that Mour@@ in@@ ho wanted to have another new commitment in this week , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of its four main new comm@@ itments . &quot;
&quot; three of them to get , thank you for the club , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they gave themselves big trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew over Seattle in Washington State , but drawing up in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers about the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be the form of a Dream@@ box .
the whole was a permanent test for new engines .
Boeing had already taken such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new descent for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind was sp@@ inning today , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD boss , the Prime Minister held the elections to Berlin with a certain concern for Berlin . &quot;
&quot; merely no stor@@ ks from the party central , merely no head@@ wind from the federal government - so the most important wish of the soldier &apos;s electoral soldier . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has changed the fundament@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees come from Willy @-@ Brandt &apos;s house with increasing the events in the SPD @-@ driven state capit@@ als . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , Mr Schulz has been described in the approach since the beginning of the year . &quot;
there were fail@@ ures .
and one after the other .
&quot; according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU provides a general signal against Ko@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; that shows once more : red @-@ green can &apos;t rule reliable , &quot; said CDU Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising question of a Gre@@ ens has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the di@@ alling code his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
&quot; the Gre@@ et @-@ President Michael Kell@@ ner , called the Gre@@ et @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party , invited El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return their mandate . &quot;
the transition to the CDU means a clear dist@@ ortion of voters .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return their mandate immediately , &quot; &quot; said the federal leader and election campaign of the Gre@@ ens editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be all true , &quot; &quot; the SPD electoral soldier , when on Friday morning , arrived the new hi@@ kers at the party centre . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Weil , the SPD @-@ president of Lower Saxony , stands according to the transition of the El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets on the CDU without its own government majority . &quot;
it is the provisional peak of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what &apos;s next .
the Mis@@ er began to defeat an unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , are the comra@@ des of that time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
it was then - and it became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the east , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite was smooth the party . &quot;
&quot; the comra@@ des in the weeks after that , the comra@@ des were re @-@ tried again . &quot;
&quot; then , when she had done just a new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit arrived from Hamburg . &quot;
and with it came the next wave .
&quot; Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD district , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town was burnt . &quot;
&quot; and because in the crisis communications afterwards everything was wrong , everything one can make wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z fights for his political survival . &quot;
so now Stephan Weil .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister has already been a long @-@ term criticism for the supervisory board . &quot;
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tures were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps that &apos;s why , because in the past weeks , I tried to put stronger in the covenant . &quot;
comra@@ des from Hanover &apos;s former Mayor to build his power in Berlin remained not hidden by comra@@ des in the environment of Martin Schulz .
&quot; they left him , as they gave away a stabili@@ zation of the party . &quot;
now the exact opposite might occur .
&quot; for that , because of the part@@ isan hospital , the lower sax@@ on green@@ ery is basically not guilty . &quot;
and Schulz is not at all .
&quot; sometimes , comra@@ des are trying to keep their own rows closed . &quot;
their wrath is on the Gre@@ ens and above all on the ab@@ stain@@ ed par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democr@@ atically @-@ provo@@ king , as Mrs. T@@ jack@@ ets present their own car@@ ri@@ er@@ ings about the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of part@@ itions in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ jack@@ ets are not elected because of its person as direct can@@ did@@ acy , but on the state list of the Dutch Party in parliament , the Lower Saxony is further dep@@ uties . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; voters off four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil &apos;s prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who conduc@@ ts the SPD election as a top candidate in the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career perspectives of a future CDU member endor@@ se the election result , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot;
he demanded the back@@ grounds to investigate .
I want to know if there was more or more of the CDU Niedersachsen have been given .
convey@@ ors for Ort@@ sk@@ iers III
&quot; who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years , will soon receive support from the country . &quot;
about this informed Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of the city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of the events at the beginning of the information event .
&quot; since 1991 , there is a sensation in sens@@ ing areas . &quot;
&quot; at the time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the surplus was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous sanctions are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it was finally important to promote the interior design and exclu@@ de only new construction areas . &quot;
on 4 April I received the information from the Karlsruhe Government &apos;s government to give information that there will be a san@@ itation area III .
&quot; the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the church sens@@ ations . &quot;
how does a san@@ itation area develop ?
&quot; we will continue to investigate so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it plays a role whether in the planned area of all interest arise , to renov@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , then the local borders could then move again . &quot;
&quot; the Ste@@ g came on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the League @-@ countries &apos; Social City &apos; program , which would then be performed during the restoration . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of internal cities , improving the residential and working conditions and preser@@ vation of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; measures would be objec@@ tively related , that is held per property . &quot;
the rehabilitation zone would eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
&quot; the eligi@@ bility period for funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 still until April 30 , 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; however , until September this year , however , the data recording would only be carried out , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area involved a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the order may be made as possible , therefore in the coming year with the sanctions should be started . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann , subsequently , explained that every municipality must carry out the said preliminary investigations . &quot;
&quot; it is about to evaluate and decide to evaluate the city circumstances and decide , when it is renov@@ ating and at what extent . &quot;
there will be also a renovation in the basic book for the respective property .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sens@@ ations , and become a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed an essential success factor for the project to be the participation of those involved .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires which may be sent post@@ al@@ ically to citizens in the coming weeks , and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionna@@ ires is the &quot; &quot; building and boundary arc &quot; &quot; in which it comes to structural condition and san@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; information can be used to size , spl@@ itting and residents of a residential home . &quot;
the blue &quot; Oper@@ ational arc &quot; can only be filled when operated in the building areas .
&quot; however , please note that Got@@ zel pointed out that a bott@@ led Quest@@ ion@@ na@@ ire is not an application for funding at the same time . &quot;
new structural measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler was still stressed that the distribution of the funding is working according to the &quot; Wind@@ Dog principle &quot; - who first comes first .
they could not reserve a funding gap for later . &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; was shown to make the attendance of a reconstruction &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot;
&quot; British inventor himself uses a micro@@ chip to come with a movement in house and car , &quot;
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door , his office and even can start his car . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , impl@@ ements the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ge@@ off Watson , a consult@@ an@@ aes@@ thet@@ ist of the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , closed to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology is similar to a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles in houses and cars , that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a cost of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins , when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
white home costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event , which raises the American production in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the figures of the military that were left to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event was on July 17th in the White House with American Civil programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and Chief of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a yacht out of Maine , a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck was issued in Connecticut . &quot;
&quot; the Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the Hel@@ icop@@ ter Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event its su@@ peri@@ ors , the deputy military commander of aviation . &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on 17 July against 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 in this evening .
&quot; note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second team would be needed for the return flight . &quot;
&quot; the initial licence was during the event , during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained at the ground during the time . &quot;
&quot; of the TIM@@ E provided by the TIM@@ E records , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately necessary . &quot;
the Hatch Act prohib@@ its federal plans to use state property for political purposes .
data sets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could harm the determination .
&quot; a question , which we presented , was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked up , &quot; the deputy commander answered . &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave a violation of the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated efforts to con@@ strain the government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but its use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; Tr@@ ump brought an investigation into February of an investigation , when the presidential plane was in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compl@@ ained about the use of the Presi@@ dential Guard by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy press of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 Occup@@ ation often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in South La@@ wn , to set the US president in the White House with precise centi@@ meter . &quot;
&quot; as Tr@@ ump early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise varieties in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event attracted the training requirement of the aircraft crew for the month , said an official . &quot;
&quot; in addition , hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew in an additional 11 hours a day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support commis@@ sions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved , put the helicopter to the South La@@ wn . &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not do budgets for the presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the US Ministry of Defence for fiscal 2017 , the D@@ H @-@ 3D tax rate is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft at a 30 minutes from the regional base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance , and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the training rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance , and contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former press conference of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent . &quot;
and I think the most Americans are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans worked in@@ ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; it is , of course , appropriate to raise it . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump with the helicopter inter@@ acts as he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of fire cars . &quot;
&quot; at the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked the media about his own fleet of corporate products . &quot;
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC @-@ Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
top runner of the Second Tennis Bundesliga team at the standings in the ranking of the standings S@@ V .
TC @-@ White Ne@@ uss appears tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel on the standings in the standings in Kiel .
&quot; despite the five games still fl@@ aw@@ less balance sheet , the top ranking of the Second tennis league has received the sense for reality . &quot;
team chief Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite a similar formation . &quot;
on the back positions I find the team very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V especially the imports from the high north .
&quot; their Danish and Finn@@ s can even refer to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strongly in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay overlooking Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben O@@ reading , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ erre@@ h@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; it will be , as always hard for us . &quot;
&quot; you need a good luck , too . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er crew for the trip to the high north is practically .
his debut for Blue @-@ White could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; at the moment it makes the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active French@@ man not to the Bundesliga game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will be playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament for his first use in this season . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ defeated Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo appeared yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ans An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ ski , at the ATP tournament in K@@ itz@@ b@@ üh@@ el . &quot;
&quot; he was supposed to be at the same time as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ school@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Julien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two wins last Sunday against the Club , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also be back into the team again . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one in the Junior World R@@ ank@@ ings in January 2016 , does someone fill the cad@@ res from the trainer around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay . &quot;
how to harm the O@@ MV O@@ MV
&quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump doesn &apos;t work when he put his signature on the Law for En@@ er@@ ting the sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his ha@@ ste , the law en@@ acted , &quot; the Congress wrapped a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even in Brussels up@@ side against the U.S. fores@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; after all , the design looks forward to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build Gas@@ pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors of loc@@ als O@@ MV has been worried since then , together with other European companies , co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian eastern se@@ d@@ line North Stream 2 . &quot;
the threat is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it was too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would actually have to raise the sanctions per Executive Order for life . &quot;
twelve weapons are charged with him .
&quot; the press &quot; has viewed , which the Group could withstand and what would really hurt him . &quot;

roll back@@ wards : the city represents 46 kitchen staff
the city organized the K@@ ita mid@@ way back .
fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team .
&quot; in the urban day@@ care centres , the clock is turned back . &quot;
&quot; as of September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supplies in the urban children &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant head of the youth welfare state , it is good news : &quot; we are all very happy . &quot;
furthermore the house is cooked : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and provides fresh @-@ boiled co@@ ols .
&quot; the city runs in the area of 46 day@@ care centres , in 44 the children get a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; last kit@@ ten year , 2800 children each sat at the tables , and the need is constantly growing . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for about 45 week@@ days in the K@@ ita , &quot; Pom@@ er@@ anz will be discussed . &quot;
the offer is also available in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 Parti@@ al forces have served on 1 September kitchen service : they warm the angel@@ ic food , complement your salad , raw food and fruits , arrange the meal individually , give food out , clean and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group groups as well as seven @-@ scale institutions - decides about the hour@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen staff now belongs to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
for this reason it is : healthy eating and cooking classes .
the children are to help to prepare food .
the direct connection of the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , one person that is familiar to them and not constantly changing human beings . &quot;
this continu@@ ity was important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
&quot; in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen power , this variation , the separation of cleaning and kitchen service , has also developed the charm for the city as the most economic , it is from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 partial @-@ time workers are dis@@ continued . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall for around 750 people in the gu@@ ardian area not so strong in weight , &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , re@@ ig@@ ning leader of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are di@@ pped by the council elections in the provinces . three women are en@@ code for the role of Vice President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ rated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credible if women are un@@ restricted and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ ani elections for the provincial Council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; the Taliban have published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ de with the transition of international mar@@ tial arts to an advisory role . &quot;
this year the elections for the first time will receive power peace@@ fully from a democr@@ atically elected government .
&quot; Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women is still to intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afghan Independent Review Commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB concerns about investment in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make a union with the managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie over long @-@ term commitment to the Glasgow factory in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant in addition to other products Hob@@ by@@ bs and Rich Tea biscuits .
&quot; in recent years , Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
he added that employees and trade union representatives were &quot; first experienced &quot; when their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the manager of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s , &quot; concerns to express that funding will not be driven by moderni@@ zation of production lines . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB Senior organizer Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity of the general needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members deeply . &quot;
&quot; families of families have been working here and the labour force focus heavily on local community and large @-@ room Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of job creation , wage and well @-@ being , and before the background of Bre@@ xit , rising production costs and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urg@@ ently urg@@ ently needed a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; the manager of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the man manager at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB , and the company will react directly to it since we estimate the ongoing commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed the employees that we operate as all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain business climate , constantly review our businesses - and this applies to all our business divisions and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; it added : &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operating improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site full and at all . should our work processes change at location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , the PS@@ G has been warned against Ne@@ ym@@ ar ? &quot;
the site of La Liga likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not aband@@ on her persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar , after she had given a quot@@ ation of £ 189 million to resolve its free@@ wheel cl@@ amp , but have they been warned against the world record three years ago ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has reached the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous one , Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after the completion of the world , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the highest @-@ paid pro sport@@ s@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is mad about the way , as Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced his way outside , although a source in the vicinity of the Catal@@ ans fore@@ sees is that the club has always given his best to take care of him from Santos in 2013 to take care of him . &quot;
but was the soccer world three years ago had been warned of the PS@@ G pre@@ sidents of this view ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 he was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they touch one of our players , then we will contact us in opposition ; we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; however , if they try to sign one of our players to sign up , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , the Spanish Club has put an interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they wouldn &apos;t allow it to travel from Italy to the International Criminal Court , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing its price for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;

interview : &quot; dom@@ spar@@ rows report &quot; Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger
the reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows report to the abuse of Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ carriage sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ row continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ nder , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; stated after publication against the German press agency , he expected by former President Bene@@ dict XVI , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the retired Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , an exc@@ use . &quot;
it would be very used to see the appearance of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound ties or their then false assessment of the int@@ ages .
&quot; on the other hand , the Vatican City Council &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that reporting on violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen plant will be measured &quot; two different measures . &quot; &quot;
&quot; regarding the transition in Regensburg , nobody doub@@ ting that it would have to be &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful deeds , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Hist@@ orian and Member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the acc@@ ust@@ omed to describe the Catholic Church as the source of all the ev@@ ils , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep that for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; one likes to go on the church , and this is a little fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; beats a completely normal educational means &quot; have been , &quot; to be done with little children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; they are un@@ fair to use today &apos;s standards to earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports about the mis@@ use cases , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger came up often . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says E@@ zek@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg with the declaration of declaration attor@@ ney Ulrich Weber ? &quot;
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s . 67 Dom@@ spar@@ rows has been sexually ab@@ used .
&quot; in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; summar@@ izing , that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases of physical and psychological violence were applied . &quot;
&quot; especially at high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , the pun@@ ishments for the students were even worse . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims will inv@@ ade the general humanity by R. , and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann , why the final report on the mis@@ carriage sc@@ andal at the Basel Dom@@ spar@@ row , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 pages report about the &quot; &quot; incid@@ ents of violence at the shel@@ ters of protective films &quot; &quot; has been a contradic@@ tory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one lift , many students make his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the other , he appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and Perf@@ ect@@ ant who has been tan@@ gible , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has won no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : when you make the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask themselves rather , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears in it . &quot;
he is dedicated to eight sides and he is clearly acquitted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
&quot; outside of its activity , violence took place in pre@@ school outside of its environment . &quot;
&quot; they can , at all , dis@@ card , experienced it too late or not seriously taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ gramm@@ ar , on which he worked , was experienced by almost all respondents as liter@@ al - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also represents an excellent witness , describing him as &quot; &quot; warm @-@ heart@@ ed &quot; , &quot; as extremely good @-@ heart@@ ed teachers , who provided the boys regularly with cakes , cookies and cand@@ y , and always st@@ aff@@ ed by the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his Perf@@ ect@@ ism and its high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality which also led to W@@ ut@@ o@@ uns .
&quot; that he did not only cast them with chairs and cast the keys and on the floor , but also w@@ asted and too nau@@ gh@@ ty guys to the hair or ears , he has already regre@@ t@@ ted , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; however , to its honorary rescue must however be said that such educational methods were widely used in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents like with teachers . &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I have also experienced it in a world@@ ly school , a state high school . &quot;
&quot; compared with what is about to do in this report , the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and the non @-@ violence in pre@@ school are the most certainly Bag@@ at@@ ella . &quot;
&quot; one asks oneself if not to do with his public@@ ity and his role as brother to Bene@@ dict XVI &apos;s brother , many media have just thrown on him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian Pope , many people who never understand him , still eager to work . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , the report was reported very much about the subject of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was also placed in his final report or involvement with sexual abuse in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
&quot; no one of the 67 victims of sexual acquis@@ itions , claiming to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister . &quot;
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ken@@ ed to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said an aff@@ ect@@ ant representative for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing to me . &quot;
&quot; the true problem with the declaration of sexual abuse , and yet is that most victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they did not even believe his parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then not a chor@@ us manager , who would certainly have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ spar@@ rows students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael E@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated it this way : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I see ... no case where he would have had written evidence ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and would have been able to stop the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd , accept that , reck@@ oned to him ... Bu@@ ben in@@ sist@@ ent or more or more , than in relation to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ al conduc@@ tors , confidenti@@ ality teachers , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able .
&quot; thus the report came to the very clear result : &quot; that in advance , concerned the pupils and / or their environment , could not be confirmed during the investigation . &quot;
&quot; regarding sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to talk about everyone . &quot;
&quot; so it cannot be accused of having prevented him , or to ad@@ vert him . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradic@@ ted crimes , as it happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; was to be read at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was accused of &quot; &quot; looking &quot; . &quot; &quot;
must he live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : that &apos;s the big issue that everything was mixed and confused to a huge king of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; however , exactly that is a mis@@ use of the report . &quot;
&quot; it is separated by : between the pre@@ school and high school of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as we say , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report incid@@ ents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not chor@@ us conductor of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; the whole horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where the boys of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers were extingu@@ ished and mal@@ evol@@ ent , all took place at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sk@@ id conditions have to have re@@ igns . &quot;
&quot; but with those who became Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face , when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ gramm@@ ar school . &quot;
&quot; it was , as most witnesses emphas@@ ize , the theme of &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; conditions .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ gramm@@ ar school ?
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : there was discipline at that time , but no sa@@ amen violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims of the general humanity are inv@@ alu@@ able and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; at most , the accus@@ ation must be looked away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could define only two periods where it was reported from the states on the pre@@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the predecess@@ ors at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( as the witness ) had nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger up close to the conditions consistently ?
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasium who even re@@ produced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this fact , he points out that in the pre@@ school , he still pract@@ ises the test penalty . &quot;
&quot; in view of the risk of negative press release , he recommended urgent income . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity had long been banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they took place in a legal grey zone , as everyone knows us still white . &quot;
&quot; there was hard to estimate for him , where the victims were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramatic and where really the permissible limit has been exceeded . &quot;
but one can &apos;t say that he was ever swe@@ pt away .
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the Prü@@ fer was officially abolished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed that it was un@@ fair to apply ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to time for that time . &quot;
how do you see it ?
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : we speak histori@@ ans from the &quot; &quot; Fall@@ out of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; &quot; so the danger of the past to present day @-@ mor@@ atorium . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has quite right there .
&quot; but that is , of course , not for sexual abuse , that was ab@@ ated at all times and not for what was broken in pre@@ school in the pre@@ school and violence of innocent children suffering , that is far beyond that time . &quot;
&quot; all that is horri@@ ble , and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be resum@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his funds for disciplines and punishment , thus ear@@ ths and ears , were widely used in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment , then he was strictly prohibited . &quot;
&quot; what image of his rainy days has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ? &quot;
was the topic of the test in this context also to the language ?
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , tells of his perspective , since the Dom@@ spar@@ rows played only one side role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I no means no means that he was a dev@@ out regim@@ ent there . &quot;
&quot; but also this must be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without which in@@ demand un@@ related discipline , it would probably hardly have been possible to form a real cultural ambassador in Europe and its musical tradition that went out twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with cookies and cand@@ y alone one makes a rebellious child once again no big singer and standing before every success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self over@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; what kind of people have you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who talks to her book ? &quot;
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I &apos;ve really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger over and always experienced a wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , glorious , believing and heart@@ felt good people , from which one could not do something to do something . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m getting regularly , how many former Dom@@ spar@@ rows are still happy today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact to him , read it - he is almost blind and treated him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who didn &apos;t forgive him until today , that he once was strict to them , so clearly are in the minority . &quot;
&quot; most Dom@@ spar@@ rows are thank@@ ful to him today , that he has enriched their lives and communic@@ ated to them the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he always was a good , pat@@ ern@@ able teacher , a str@@ ingent father , certainly like that - but also a lov@@ able respect , to which they still perceive and hon@@ oring them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once more clearly , all that throws him are educational methods which were then on the agenda back then . &quot;
we can be happy that we have overcome this time ago .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man , only because it is promin@@ ently and one more prominent brother to make a personal fall . &quot;
&quot; the evil intention behind it is , there is only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report which has just been released , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the lawyer would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired big mer@@ its and without the outside of Bay@@ erns , and perhaps Germany would probably know any of the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
