<seg id="1">"Munich, 1856: four cards that change your view on the city"</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt where youths meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">"a tomb chapel, where is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small vinedressers cultivate the rusty reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card Münch promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">"it's nervous, when maps are not currently up."</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone who had to be exciting because the Auto Navi was instead of a strapping road to a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlas, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are all other than currently - yet very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when compared to current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"then, it becomes clear how towns and municipalities have changed in the district area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a tile carpet which is not recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"for cities and municipalities, more detailed maps, so-called uranium blades, were incorporated into the great coverage card."</seg>
<seg id="13">"these were developed according to the Bavarian surveying management between 1810 and 1864, and in the first surveying Bayerns."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Bavaria has occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops finally went down with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801, it was the present neighbors, which created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max. Joseph drove the project further, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration."</seg>
<seg id="19">The prototype for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is to be found as all others at the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the comparison, for example, is the most impressive of the state capital."</seg>
<seg id="21">The city expanded into all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is subjecting, which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was arrested 21 years after the creation of the card, so 1877, in the Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of the people are concentrated in 1856 along today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming, there is a smaller sheet with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten entries from the so-called" "primitive" "from which the base tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"there are little plots today, no farmers more - but small bandmen of the plant" land in sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is characterised by the north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene from the Oktoberfest, was actually a meadow, and there was no concrete desert in the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the primitive place one reads in the district of today's Au-Haidhausen district court, not just the street names" "on the restaurant" "- but also in great letters" "Irren Anstalt." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here in the Auerfield highway one once closed people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">There was a place there in 1858 / 59 in the Munich district-Irish Institution "On the Auer Lüders."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudder headed the establishment of his psychiatrist who, in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and ended, for example, the chains of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"he also taught the personnel to use violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients had been at first place, later on 500 seats were extended."</seg>
<seg id="38">Some point did not attain this capacity - the reason for the building of the county Institute in Hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the area of former Auer Anstalt, young people encounter the Munich Salesianum in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the Order acquired the building complex in 1920, and transformed him into a youth home with training."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the football pitch of the TSV Munich east is east, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, we built the Children's House" Casa Don Bosco "- in a architeconical reference to the origins of the Irrenaissance, which had been destroyed during the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was in 1856 as the "main square" where Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger alley."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change took place in the Second World War as well as in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"the Allies were fired by the Allies, in December 1944, many holes in downtown."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English institute, small business houses and a Gruftkapelle from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof, where these days work on and on April 5, 2017, the Spatenstich will take place for the second S-Bahn station."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the shooting gallery, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photo of today - and the hole in the Marienhof will be replenished."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group released travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Fares has issued a warning for colored people due to discriminating policies and racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Committee for the Federal State of Missouri, which is scheduled to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians, as a number of fragility, racial origin occur in recent times throughout the state and will be noted," says in the opinion of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently said law of Missouri, which makes it harder to complaining, and the prosecuting authorities of the state that opposes unproportionate to minorities, demonstrating the group to release the travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, which people happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are appealed or killed because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," said the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear problems in such a frequency, which we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization exhibited for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group quoted incidents such as racist violations of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances of the beginning of the year, after having no more fuel during the journey by the Missouri, and by the Missouri police arrested in custody without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recently published report by the Missouri Office of the Missouri, in which she will be shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and informed about their families, friends and staff, which might happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">"people need to be ready to bring it to the state, or their relatives know that they are traveling through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015, Missouri recorded 100 of them in the year 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI-receding statement of the FBI, which ranks the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it difficult to complain a company because of residential or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) adopted a travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the United States committed immigration authorities to undertake people for migrant workers, which will contribute to the ACLU for further development purposes."</seg>
<seg id="66">"foreign warnings are generally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in the last time, stakeholders have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Wheat-aunting project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherman Weidezvaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Corps Peter White and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on the site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"when the Schwendemann family in the Schwendemann family, representatives of the village of CDU-local association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into its operation in which he supplies 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, and as well as many young cows, houses in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Black Forest "is responsible for him the alternative steady supply for the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Ferihorts comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also the BLHV-Chairman of fishing ban, he described the fence as" elementary. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't manage top areas on derart.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area for much work, much must be processed with the engine line."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have been here with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann stressed. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the elteral operation and processed these without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not use any bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the Commune recognized the importance of the crossover project and is happy with the leaders."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would need to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">"you hope, that the surface of the surfaces could be moved out for a while."</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have, are the people working in agriculture and are thinking about how they continue to continue their farm," the mayor stressed. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often because of the fostering often in the critique</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 members of eleven participants were fenced in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure of the area is thus 40 hectares that cannot be applied until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leaders was funded, a quarter of the village of Fisbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"consequently, the farmer stayed 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km's fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of fences," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" you are doing a really good job, without farmers and concubines. "</seg>
<seg id="90">"Peter White, also firm for Peter White, was the best food produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The state-care centres (lpr) Baden-Württemberg enables state-to-state support of fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Precondition is the presence of one of the lpr recorded patrons.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the area must not be dragable (Hangar over 35 percent) and must be threatened by the reception."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the 2018 Fisdecimal Project 2018, the application of eight participants is currently running with 24 plots, which would like to build more than 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the discovers area corresponds to 35 hectares, the estimated cost of more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking off the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as any other - hence the care of having staged downfall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-regime, certainly did know what he did when he took an symbolic ancestry in an ovy dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the president towards drastic limitations with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller does not handle the statue himself."</seg>
<seg id="103">"a horde from Boatters and Liberty Imiters would have landed him, if he had done it."</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he grabbed its importance, and especially the importance that you were attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"Miller Acosta chimplies:" I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is objectively correct, but how he formulated it, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the elaborating words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state is not only any old immigrants, but the poor of the poor:" your poor, your poor, and your afflicted masses, who are looking for free to breathe freely, / howling of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "eling waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">"Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA."</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus and her friends who used to place their words after her death on the basis - knew very well, that they did a highly political action."</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the links between French and American Republicans by showing the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classic picture.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus changed these meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And they themselves have a completely different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poetry with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and precisely how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change this long back from the right wing."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great Schreier Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for coming from Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was to bring to the American flame into the converted world:" Lady Liberty goes forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">Torch shall not turn the way into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the stand-point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great phantastic act of Lazarus existed in it, as they see from the exhaustive, elending, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys to the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense of being able to see the world from the perspective of people, seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">"their statue says to them the words of hope, and of the welcome which they must hear."</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not to recognize the perspective, the Miller and Trump."</seg>
<seg id="127">"her torch shall not lighten the way, but the hatred that is the only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Estyie Doyle reminds of a time when only two Scots were to be a team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of athletics in the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of Scottish contingent in the world championship will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record-breaking Scottish athlete was chosen for London in 2017 on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland" something special was developed "and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand it and we will continue to find out until we find out," "Black said."</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athlets think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics Men: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several Scottish athletes are medals candidate, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butler - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit while Eiliie Doyle was elected team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captains was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"passion and genuine sense, the eiliie very natural, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth-Silver medal winner who will compete in their fifth world championships at 400 m hurdles says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots in the British team are.</seg>
<seg id="145">"the best total number of athletes at the world championship were seven, which had been reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The midfielder Muir leads on this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m is another Scotsman, one after a great season, holding the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the teams states that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only among the team, but in some cases also with medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about the team chapter, lies in it that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor to know, but to know that my team mates have voted for me and I have voted for myself," "she added."</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the villi, which belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb in Poorts."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned as a capitalist?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think they went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to place on this home support and to benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it will be just a great atmosphere there outside."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics on Facebook: do not worry about a public position if you can't heat the heating by voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him for all, from the interior politics to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he implies with the criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783 Washington said," "The freedom of expression may be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, as sheep are led to the slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked contributions of at least 450 people and have cleared their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained about this because of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor of the governor dismissed the action as a frivolan, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," many people said. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest ranking of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also skillfully sent to use Facebook as a primary means to interconnect with his voters and play his haired head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons that come on the side of the governors - which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax-Dollars - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse argued the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments had nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too simple to use the picture of trot or spammers, or hassmet people that swaying the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a parish, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not professionals."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in His post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hassmet, but she asked for them."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I said polite that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate and other latest news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news show "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people are taking place on the same subject, then they are rather abused as a so-called collective use, and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the employees of the governor as a "concentrated spam assault" would probably call other "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic, or delete a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is far more cleaner than in previous time, if one had done the same time that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guiding hand and to burn protesters."</seg>
<seg id="191">Exactly this is exactly digitally done.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials that criticises Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">"President Trump is denounced by Twitter users, who were blocked by his Twitter feed."</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell to Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County, last the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voters from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous boxes, struck on its leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had trolls trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used Pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that Washingies decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions that criticised his position on the contract of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain criticised, overwhelmed his ministry, according to historical documents collected by the online Papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't put them into silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom, Expression and Discourses belong to our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed her bags and has sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room," Joanne said. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"to me this apartment was shown in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">"I fell in love with her, and made a special offer on this day."</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1.000 square feet was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a screened layout - one had to go through the kitchen to go into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"to this end, she instructed the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to take advantage of 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home not only a development, but also a place to life for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Fan had to be creative thinking to solve the submission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together, without having to gaps ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about to build a simple platform, but put the steel so that it had the right height above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement gave it Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of skewers plays an important role in adding theater, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored, to have him longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, units offer space for all the jars and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can exclude the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a little bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is important to it, so that if you push the door, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clevered use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, real estate agents are entering and a calculation based on the base size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they managed to enlarge the floor area and use high-quality materials that make room its luxurious benefit."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and therefore helping to create an emotional ties in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love yourself in electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they don't play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"it shows that an apartment is characterized by good design, and increased square meterical value of something standard, which can transform something quite literally."</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new Chief of Staff plans to limit the President's Media Abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others tried it and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"POLITICO says that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Trump - including reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss in a more uniform course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, joined the White House on his first day of work with senior employees, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: bad information taken into the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information should flow on him - whether on paper or in mail - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps Relationship to Television goes back for decades - and now, where he is at the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if the Trump was angry because of a fair coverage, it was productive to show him that he had received a fair coverage of places that were to convince," said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February against POLITICO. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"in fact, Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keep Trumps Twitter Habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials, to ensure that his personal media sum involves a permanent praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter is ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign leaders know something we don't know - that Trumps Tweets would have included even more ignition material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn about the Tweets that Trump hasn't sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff have made it a few times to keep anger from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"but no one has to prevent it resolutely, that Trump controversy surmises."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"a part of the problem consists that people in a White House, which consists of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by presenting Trump material, which may potentially promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"POLITICO - dealing with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors, to bring unquestioning information of strategic reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump is able to react to negative press releases, especially those with damaged leaks, and that it's out that they come out."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly this happened at the end of February, when somebody ignited a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of Katie Walsh, called the source behind a cluster to be at the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"though Johnson had been banned for chicans permanently from Twitter, or that he had no specific evidence or that he expressed false accusations in the past."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started questioning employees of Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"gold-makers added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to implement and document the trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"maybe he will prove himself as an effective manager as a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counselors are still looking for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">This unchangeable factors make the Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1451">"at that time, the decision was not undisputed in the community at that time."</seg>
<seg id="1452">"but especially Freudenstadts Upper Mayors Julian Osswald defended the hotel site, and he already spoke of serious interested parties in the house at that time."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>

<seg id="1480">"in Russia's affair around US President Donald Trump, Robert Mueller is alleged to have used a so-called Grand Jury according to a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the panel recorded the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "entitled to trust people."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper valuate the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded its investigation and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The radio station CNN reported that there was already the first charges of the Grease in connection with a meeting between Trumps and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies accuse the Kremlin since a longer time targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines if there were agreements between Trumps election campaign and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, several men are to stand in the election campaign as advisor of the Republicans."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller received more and more junumps private and business environment among the magnifying glass."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the Washington Post, several weeks ago, wrote that the Sonderese Trump personally joined the centre and examined the accusation of whether the President may not hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jura is to check and decide the evidence in possible fragmentation due to whether the charges shall be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">"therefore, Grand Juries are also called concatenesses."</seg>
<seg id="1491">"mostly they are switched on, if it is a major and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process is always closed behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">"in addition, the panel is also enabled by the public prosecutor to charge people under oath."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the radio station CNN, pre-charges were issued, which turn around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"persons who were involved in meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">"besides Trump Jr., Trumps counselors and father-in-law Jared Kushner and his damaging campaign manager Paul Manafort was involved in conversation."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"right on Thursday night, on Thursday night, on Thursday night, the US television reported that Mueller won't be intimidated in his work and that it should be necessary, quickly act."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it has to be called, however, that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide about the survey of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the suspension of the Gremium is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concerns of president Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President on Thursday evening made an address in West Virginia to represent Russia's affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the theme will give the Democrats an opportunity to feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special consultant Ty Cobb explained in a statement, he knowingly nothing of the establishment of a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"these work, however, usually work in obedience, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates every action which accelerated the work of the special service in "faire" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"the former FBI boss James Comey said three times, that not opposed the president."</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"due to the root of these accusations, accusations against Trump became noisy, he did not want to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"in June, before a Senate committee in Trump, Comey asked him to investigate an investigation against the then national security advisor Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under large pressure due to the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"following US media representation, the White House collected material against the special issuer and employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">That loosens speculation about whether Trump mueller is released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike a more independent president of Congress such as in the Watergate affair, Richard Nixon, Mueller sent a position in which he could be fired by the president of the Ministry of Justice in theory."</seg>

<seg id="1521">"over a trillion tonne of heavy and 5800 square kilometer large Koloss toss now to the north and will probably need two, three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"it is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the largest iceberg, who have registered researchers in the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"as far as climate change played a role in the demolition of the iron branch, it is unclear according to research data."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, there was a series of unusual cops in the region for some 30 years, the U.S. research center for snow and ice cream (NSIDC) writes in a fact."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>

<seg id="1528">"whistle floats on the sea, and is fed by great glaciers."</seg>
<seg id="1529">It is growing steadily towards the sea and breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis lies south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this Schelfeises was the equilibrium of waxes and abrupting a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete whistle was falling there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are some evidence that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis are in danger, because the front edge is not so far advanced as at present."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice top stand under tension and can disintegrate if there is a slice."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg do not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and pushes the ice as much water as it is according to the melting pot."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the eliculture leads to the glacier that leads to the sea directly into the sea and much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the level of sea level, but only in small dimensions, the British research project writes to the Observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI-data, Larsen-C-Selfeis is the fourth biggest schooner on Antarctica after AWI."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"on the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge of the free ocean some 200 metres."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural face, and not a direct connection to climate change, the ice plate comes into a dangerous position," says Martin O'Leary, by the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most broadest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists had disputed whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeifer will be back and fall back in the long term, and possibly coincides," said his colleague Adrian Luckman, added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this trend will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even though these researchers will not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg, not on climate change, so in the past decades, however, there are very many icebergs in the Antarctic peninsula."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic peninsula has dropped by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>

<seg id="1614">"fact: e-sport has long been a long-growing sector, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1615">This is also recognized by the first German ligaverages which are increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">"at the beginning of 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, which later followed the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to enthuse the brand new young target groups for the VfB," says Executive Board Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>

<seg id="1630">But is it all about a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the notion is certainly ordinary."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbery has long dealt with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the German Sports- University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"it also need cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction capability."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should not only exercise in the console, but exercise their body and watch out on the diet."</seg>
<seg id="1636">The fat player is a good player.</seg>
<seg id="1637">But Frobbery also sees problems: "doping is always a theme."</seg>

<seg id="1639">The researchers highlighted the high inclusive effect of the E-Sports.</seg>

<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales are expected to lie at 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football league, this is little bit."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport must not be far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice-hockey," write the Deloitte Consultant. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The Assassination of a journalist emphasises growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The assistants of the weekly Rioce usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised civil servants and unceable drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">"it was informed them, that it is important to change their routines."</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which were the aim of aggression with grenades in 2009, or leaving them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a plaque at the front of the room: opponent, neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"please ask the reporter, propose a name for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal cavity."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"drug adugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there are no rest-break from violence, and throughout the country the corpses are still more journalists: at least 25, since then President Enrique Pena Nieto passed his position in December 2012. at least, there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, their publishers and their inspiration from Rioce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is deeply felt, though his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, that depicts his midfinger with the word" Justice ". two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, who smiling his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamanian."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although Attorney General in 2010 was established to process the cases of journalists, these according to the Committee to the Protection of journalists took only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders that are linked with drug dealers and organized crimes each year, the murderer will rarely be challenged by journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Rioce, they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa while they are unbreakable, even though the terrain is now slated."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting concerning the discussion of safety, Ibarra says."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very foolish, to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the Why, we suspend all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the newspaper Rioce's office in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he just managed to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. he was shot from his car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" 12th river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left one wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours inclined to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrest during the past year and the extradition of the country in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloodiest battlesions of the country, as rival factions are struggling to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"there is nothing that is shot in Sinaloa every day or several people on the road, or that the cemetery is full of married, two-story mausoleeen for drug roommates, which are bigger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget about a minute that there is a state of" rest, "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the rival factions in war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this release may have offended the sons, presumed gear members bought each copy of the output as soon as they delivered to the newspaper kioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez's mistake, after the seizure of another newspaper, which had published the same story, to leave the country to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues took that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He served as an experienced journalist in 2003 when he sold himself with five colleagues to the establishment of Rioce and sold 50 U.S. dollar shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without offend the dash of poison, "" said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"at the time, the newspaper promised a call for courageous and honest coverage, and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved it to be able to publish hard treachings without fear of censorship and the readers were fascinated by a publication that could read stories that nobody else did to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Rioce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Award "for their reporting in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in that same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists from the persecution of the Mexican drug history, where she always led them."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said to the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug dealers in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You need to take the job that as a journalist - either the or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I would not want to be asked: "what did you do in the sight of many dead... why did you not say what went before?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Rioce team measures Valdez, the fun bird, who, like a dockworkers, was able to curse the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, going to sit there on the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now, ask them: was his love for routine being calamity?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to ask her own involvement in question, as they can do their work at the best and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it, if you encounter with their wives, their children, their little stores, their home starting and runways, to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instinct.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"when it smells wrongly, stay away."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the publisher of the Rioce Andres Villarreal said that" smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the matter is happening with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the ancient rules, as he and others say, will not apply in Sinaloa, as well as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative dirt, weak institutions and corrupt government officials."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the employees of Rioce met for security training, there were suddenly no cell phones allowed. days earlier, Spyware that is sold exclusively to governments and used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Two policemen were seeking protection outside the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Rioce in a four-storey building in Culiacan area.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in joke, some of the reporters asked whether this Officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen who described the governor himself as non-trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporter went into the mountain landscape, where the drug conglomerates de facto is under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Rioce added three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There were the murder of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an Exposé to the State Duma, focused on the hometown of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about what was kidnapped or as it happened, so caution was commanded when it was time to write, what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of local drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public notes that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who ruled the ruling Institutes Party Party (PRI) which ruled the entire century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-quality cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal bat the reporter concerning previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman passed a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, readers of Valdez's readers have considered the best informed source of the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we would have known what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "El FLACO" because of its slender body. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, to protest against the killing of journalists, because the employees have become something that they would never expect: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez shooting a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning due to another journalist for the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>

<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accuse the authorities to give journalists and kill them because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"it has since then asked that it is subdivided by the government, because she is worried that their anger has hurt their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organizing crimes, involved in government officials and a valid society." "</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism "he wrote that reporter could not only be killed by drug laws, but also on orders of politicians and security forces with organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"in the past year, the media group" Articulo 19 "was assigned more than half of the attacks on the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you die, because they want you to hold the mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>

<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home country or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and seek hazards."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted as evidenced by the photographer Reuben Espinosa, who was apparently assassinated with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>

<seg id="1923">"at first glance, it looks like a statue, although a scary."</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers have found that the first findings of an unbelievable rhinocorns of a Canadian miners have been so well preserved that experts have described it as a "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well preserved that they could even realize that his slipple skin was brown - and they said she would have had something from a "unquiet past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described him as" the upholstered dinosaurs, who ever has been found, and one of the best dinosaurs copies of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">"the fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier, who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well-preserved state has researchers, who described it as" really remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armoured plant-eaters is the best known Fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he had dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something which appeared from the surrounding rocks at the plateau, and decided to be more precise."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent into the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal in the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earthennia."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all these hard work, the ready result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you have blinking only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main autor Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrrell Museum where the creation is visible. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will go to the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and preserved dinosaurs specimens - the mona Lisa of the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found out that this plant-eaters, although covered with a armor, resembles a convertible breastplate, probably from meat carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide, and used a paratroopers that is known as counter-attening, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to mix well in his surroundings, to spread its enemies, say experts, which indicates that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creation from the Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the museum techniques Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7.000 hours to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the astonishing preservation of a single specimen enabled it to document the Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of shed and armaments about his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the pattering, a widespread defence method in animal rich, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than their base."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the accounts are customary, the results are unexpected, as the size of Borealopelta exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs roared from sufficient pressure by the nivorous dinosaurs, that the evolution of the confrontation was benefited as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that apply the counter-shading - think of Rehe, Zebras or girdules - are much smaller and injurious as spoils, what signals that this Nodoscope was exposed to a true struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator-behavior on a massive, strong ardued dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs rostuffed must have been", "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of dinosaurs rower was reddish.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life, including his serene Darminhaltes to find out what it had eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, came into a river and brought forth into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as South-sea today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with convened skin, but also kept in three dimensions and retains the original form of the beast," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost as much as in the early crayon period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use so much imagination to redesign it. if you only have a little with the eyes Schielen, you could almost believe that he is on sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when giant theropodes, carnivorous dinosaurs, that stood on two legs, the earth passed through."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived million years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaurs was hunted by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was lost in the sea after the death in the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he had dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the upholstered dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from muzzle to the hips."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures had an average of about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armoured plant-eaters was swamped through Western Canada by a flooded river into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the underwater exploration of the dinosaur keep his armour in exquisite detail."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the remains of this special specimen are so well preserved, that the legs still cover holprized plastic plates along the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rarely as a lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confused it will be."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"hidden parts of the skin still cover the holprized plastic plates, which wear the skull of animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right front foot sits on his side, his five fingers are split up."</seg>

<seg id="2006">"when the ticket control comes at room Y, he knows that there is a passenger with a value-off online ticket."</seg>

<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document that is to be presented.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result are endless discussions between train conductor and driving gast, which leads to poor mood in part or large space and delays in control of your own tickets and takes the train at the end of time to take care of other concerns."</seg>

<seg id="2027">He postete a picture of Brown's leaded body that was stretched out on the road and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is wild," Ferrell thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">"she put her mobile phone off, in order to return to Tweets on the Canfield-Drive in the evening."</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people who cried out, and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription:" Fergusons police killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed at which a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a rebellious dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, a different policeman made his gun and shouted:" I will kill you all. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"that is not common, Ferrell remembered her statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed and which we can call it typically.</seg>
<seg id="2036">"in this moment, I felt chills."</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was mad and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">They booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, her 6 year old daughter won her father's 6 year old daughter and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in the cinemas from the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, of love and losses, of strength and strength, which consists of the point of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell, with her daughter, wore a floral dress and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, she had a discussion that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "they remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"now we go to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't true."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her away," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be mounted in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution, and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have good luck, you experience an experience in which she personally identifies no eklatant racism, she is not unlike the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I feel like that, I would prove their bad service to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop, when they arrived in Ferguson, located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police agency which was waiting for a camping area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment by Officers Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter have joined with a local business partner."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to accept for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"after 9 August, my activism has changed totally," "she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association, and focused on essay justice and health inequalities in black congregations."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience at organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farr wanted only to document" what happened. "</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came to Ferrell: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit?</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of white - in a community that profited from their pain and their resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently said in an interview," We have heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to make it different. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for its activism around death."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment to Ferrell brought the project closer together, along with six other domestic people followed the team of" Whose Streets? "during the years after Browns."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we speak," Davis said. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are depicted, because so I will be presented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the aim was to concentrate on Ferrells's experience - to show that it is a" "Messiah" "leader but for a community that comes together," "said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents from" Whose Streets? "surprising personal aspects of Ferrells's life, as she loves and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed, when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that there must be a certain danger during this work, and with the expression of black men."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of the black gay women in the wider Black-Lives movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black teen Trayby Martin in 2012 marked the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are struggling with different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay men must carry the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"follow Folayan, noting that" the movement really is held by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not a affirmative type of action, "in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although she was in front of the front, because at one life on these cruises as a black, gay woman is so much in the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense its energy through the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the rattle connections between the community and the police continue."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"she describes the social atmosphere of the area, called her home:" chaos. ""</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless she kles herself to a singing and she feels committed to this memory, since she went into Ferguson to the street three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love one another.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "The size of": TV-readers discuss the bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit Gallery moves people, although it is still not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern zone of the pedestrian preceded by the people in favour of proponents and opponents since the first presentation 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold the subject is hardly a cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page "People and Bitburg" the subject is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to say to the bit Gallery:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" "it would be genuine" "(Nicole Showcase), comes from the other side:" "no man" "(Siggi bass) or simply:" "size" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates are building that a gallery attracts more customers in the city, including the rest of the other businesses, fear the enemy that then bleeding the pedestrian zone."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned on the property, on which the peasant market stands in which 13 direct distribution boxes can offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">Construction work will conclude with the start of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and, for Beda-Platz, with the possibility to sit outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we've been buying almost weekly in the farm brand for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm are always happy again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">The butcher we discovered for us too.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to maintain that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">There is also that in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct market in a market hall in the gallery comes up at the height of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this is likely to be low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what are the shops in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothes, shoes, throttle or supermarkets: I find the superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One sees how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least us will remain the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered here is fresh, mostly offered by the product, and is inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shop shops are rented in a shopping mall only by larger firms, because the mites are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special stores there is almost no longer and what is left of it, will probably still disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall will not fit me together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where should the peasant mark during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old EdeKA would be the solution - even on duration, when the bit Gallery is actually coming."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it already make the ghost bit Gallery to distribute all the shops of Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that is simply not functioning.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and shopping center that stands empty, nobody needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real estate market place, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But there is no place for a peasant park. just like I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant market stuttings are made, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A perfect similarity: artist creates portrait of Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown that almost imperceptible like that of the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"the 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, from Wangen-Tupres and Haarlem, who were sent to Chelsea Manning."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analysts took a 35-year prison sentence after she publicly acknowledged diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks site."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (a suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, its discipline, united in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and a pioneering dissidy, was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg created the algorithmic analysis of the DNA, created by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, such as somebody could not only look at the formability of DNA data - the many ways, as they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has been spoken openly about the identification as a woman, was convicted of 20 accusations, including six violations of the spying act, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"the prison was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white Selfie, in which Manning is intentionally sitting on a driver seat and a platinum blonde Perig is associated with them."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012-project" Stranger Visions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist portraits of strangers made from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stling and chewing gum, extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what these people might look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they brought an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "declared Dewey-Hagborg with a press review of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse were attributed to unpainted letters that had several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"she even created a comic comic opera" Supplied Images, "which was predicted to convert a future in which the president of Chelepistle would be able to view the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"indeed, Obama actually only had few days after the book was released, Manners release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happier meetings."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, as Donald Trump leads a war against informant from the government camps and against transgender troops to find new, tweaked ways to fix the rigid columns that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg, after the weird timing of all of these things, she said that" things happen in a specific reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a well-written artistic statement, Manning called for Manning with their superscript among them (the" i "in their surname) is an end of the" automatic disinformation, whose foundation is gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show involving the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the advanced scientific Lexicon of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully will take away is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective her are," "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, too."</seg>
<seg id="2147">DNA data can tell so many different stories so these are 30 of these stories.</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above-mentioned comic-Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"she shows Manning, as she appears with a release-free hand in the hand of the disciplines of the United States, as King-Hong Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your speech in cold, then they have won."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never leave the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me," "said the artist who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I always get geese when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if they should do it, it will be greeted by their own genomic simulakras, like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"it was also targeted as everything was written in the exhibition until the size (5" "2, Manning Stature), with which their genetic Hapag was written with pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had it on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd of crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement, that formed themselves with Chelsea, like the movement, which was also behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on a archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't be crazier in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robot."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start to take their ascent seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of nipples and type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the company deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey said in the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon ingival tissue that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can adapt its robot accordingly to its beliefs" "and select everything, from the eye colour of the robot into the form of nipples until the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but there is still worrying, as many robots possess the" personalities "which would look a Stepford-woman progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed into robots with a silicon ingival tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot makes it possible for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties they are appealing as an insistence."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there's the fact that Roxxxy Gold Sex-Robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of relentiness and" Wild Wendy "with a" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that has been adapted to your personality as good as possible," "oblique the site of true companion."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"during the day, she also has their moods - quite like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"you can be tired, being fixed to conversation or she can be" in mood "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many worrying aspects on this ascent of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the lowest level of relationships, the playgrounds on rape, when you get a step on Frigid (say: opposing) Farrah, worries one of the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"true on his website, true Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" it's on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their origin and its increasing refinement point in a little darker and low depth in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes towards a wish to sex with subjugation as optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men do not have a sex robot, and while the FRR notices its increasing popularity, however, they remain provisionally on the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but which leakages from the Random zones, can be very instructive in regards to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"and many people are not strange or offensive, until they have free the free market for this."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is, however, a certain overlap that this highly developed sex robot in a time scuba diving in which the rights of women are threatened with women in which the White House has a presidents who praises to have women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most terrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maidservant ') are not the graphical pictures, the swallowed body, and the outstretched eyes, but how realistically this vision seems."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind this sex robot is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (even though with Pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">"their genetic builders want to feel humankind, that they imitate the movement of a real body."</seg>
<seg id="2419">"however, to the point when it goes to their" personalities, "robots represent no real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can not separate or go away from her companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing, which indicates independence or anything, to disturb the imagination of the imagination."</seg>

<seg id="2433">"for the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left hand was strengthened by Trump, but the effective effect of its presidency has the power to move us to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"if we speak of" normalization "and Trump, we refer to the grassy possibility that our cookies will no longer be put to us."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is still a scary long-term scenario, in which Trump republicans of the right wing" normalizes, "which suddenly appear in comparison to his standards as a epitome of failure."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"I found myself from active nostalgia to Mitt Romney's funny version of the backyard - the dog on the car's shelter, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax returns) - which occur both compared to Trump in fact a very mild crime."</seg>

<seg id="2440">"the horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crispy and the animals rotate to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the klimpering music conveys this in a strange way."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"so many clichés of a city disappoint: views of high buildings become old, the Skylines become familiar to provide a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not meet the dream."</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat and dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study asserts the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000, causing stomach cramps and bleaching, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the affected will usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University finds that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that enhance a tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immuno cells in the intestine is patrol to ensure that harmful microbes, hiding in the eating, not in the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to destroy inflammation, are compensated by cells that protect tolerance and protect the body, without damage the body."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far towards inflammation, it is caused by an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experimenting, revealed that a kind of tolerance boosting immune cell occurs in mice, which carry a particular bacterium in their entrails."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" we have a connection between a bacteria type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance. "</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more Tryptophan used the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan rich nutrition can tolerate, less inflammatory bowel diseases, if the same system is in people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral degree in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cells that promotes tolerance, but found that a group of study arms such cells had, but another group of the same tribe, which was separately accommodated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it thought that the difference was to do with the intestinal microbial of mice, the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastro-intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"mice of the mice were DNA sequenced, and there were six types of bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were mounted in a sterilene environment, so that they were lacking a intestinal microbiome and they did not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers investigated L. reuteri in a liquid and then led to small amounts of liquid - without bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"the active component of the liquid has been cleaned, it proved to be a minor product of tryptophan-metabolic ism, known as Indol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice, the number of these cells increased by around 50 percent, but when the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same tolerant cells like mice and that most of us L. reuteri protect us in our gastro-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri found the cells in people as in mice but defects in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports about the misuse cases, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger came up often."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who translated" My brother of Pope "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Ezekemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly is in the 440-page report, which was presented by the diocese of Regensburg with the declaration of declaration attorney Ulrich Weber?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domsparrows were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s. 67 Domsparrows has been sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" summarizing, that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases of physical and psychological violence were applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially at high Emotionality, the punishments for the students were even worse."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other accusations, many victims will invade the general humanity by R., and therefore, in many cases, even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann, why the final report on the miscarriage scandal at the Basel Domsparrow, Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440 pages report about the" "incidents of violence at the shelters of protective films" "has been a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one lift, many students make his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"in addition to the other, he appears as a choleriker and Perfectant who has been tangible, when a Domspatz has won no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: when you make the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to ask themselves rather, why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to eight sides and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">"outside of its activity, violence took place in preschool outside of its environment."</seg>
<seg id="2916">"they can, at all, discard, experienced it too late or not seriously taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymgrammar, on which he worked, was experienced by almost all respondents as literal -" salvation, "" "heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also represents an excellent witness, describing him as" "warm-hearted", "as extremely good-hearted teachers, who provided the boys regularly with cakes, cookies and candy, and always staffed by the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his Perfectism and its high Emotionality which also led to Wutouns.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only cast them with chairs and cast the keys and on the floor, but also wasted and too naughty guys to the hair or ears, he has already regretted, deeply regretted and apologized."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to its honorary rescue must however be said that such educational methods were widely used in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents like with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I have also experienced it in a worldly school, a state high school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared with what is about to do in this report, the horrible sexual abuse and the non-violence in preschool are the most certainly Bagatella."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one asks oneself if not to do with his publicity and his role as brother to Benedict XVI's brother, many media have just thrown on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian Pope, many people who never understand him, still eager to work."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, the report was reported very much about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domsparrows."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger was also placed in his final report or involvement with sexual abuse in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">"no one of the 67 victims of sexual acquisitions, claiming to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister."</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never darkened to speak with my father or my mother," "said an affectant representative for the others," "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the true problem with the declaration of sexual abuse, and yet is that most victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even believe his parents and siblings, then not a chorus manager, who would certainly have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domsparrows students Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Eemann: a questionable student formulated it this way: "concerning sexual abuse... I see... no case where he would have had written evidence (Georg Ratzinger) and would have been able to stop the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd, accept that, reckoned to him... Buben insistent or more or more, than in relation to their parents, internatal conductors, confidentiality teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus the report came to the very clear result:" that in advance, concerned the pupils and / or their environment, could not be confirmed during the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"regarding sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free to talk about everyone."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"so it cannot be accused of having prevented him, or to advert him."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradicted crimes, as it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" non-violence "was to be read at the Regensburger Domsparrows."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was accused of" "looking". ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Eemann: that's the big issue that everything was mixed and confused to a huge king of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"however, exactly that is a misuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"it is separated by: between the preschool and high school of the Domsparrows, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as we say, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not chorus conductor of the Domsparrows."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases where the boys of sadistic teachers were extinguished and malevolent, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really skid conditions have to have reigns."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those who became Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face, when they were already at the Domspatzengymgrammar school."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"it was, as most witnesses emphasize, the theme of" Preschool "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymgrammar school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Eemann: there was discipline at that time, but no saamen violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims of the general humanity are invaluable and therefore, in numerous cases, even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at most, the accusation must be looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could define only two periods where it was reported from the states on the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible, (as the witness) had nothing to hear, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger up close to the conditions consistently?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Eemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengymnasium who even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this fact, he points out that in the preschool, he still practises the test penalty."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the risk of negative press release, he recommended urgent income."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity had long been banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they took place in a legal grey zone, as everyone knows us still white."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was hard to estimate for him, where the victims were perhaps exaggerated or dramatic and where really the permissible limit has been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say that he was ever swept away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the Prüfer was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply pedagogical standards to time for that time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Eemann: we speak historians from the" "Fallout of Anachronism," "so the danger of the past to present day-moratorium."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has quite right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but that is, of course, not for sexual abuse, that was abated at all times and not for what was broken in preschool in the preschool and violence of innocent children suffering, that is far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"all that is horrible, and I'm glad that it will finally be resumed."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his funds for disciplines and punishment, thus earths and ears, were widely used in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment, then he was strictly prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image of his rainy days has Georg Ratzinger, because in the conversations with you for the book" My brother of Pope "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the topic of the test in this context also to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Eemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, since the Domsparrows played only one side role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I no means no means that he was a devout regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but also this must be said: without these perfectionism, without which indemand unrelated discipline, it would probably hardly have been possible to form a real cultural ambassador in Europe and its musical tradition that went out twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with cookies and candy alone one makes a rebellious child once again no big singer and standing before every success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"what kind of people have you experienced Georg Ratzinger, who talks to her book?"</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I've really met Georg Ratzinger over and always experienced a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, glorious, believing and heartfelt good people, from which one could not do something to do something."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I'm getting regularly, how many former Domsparrows are still happy today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact to him, read it - he is almost blind and treated him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who didn't forgive him until today, that he once was strict to them, so clearly are in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"most Domsparrows are thankful to him today, that he has enriched their lives and communicated to them the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, paternable teacher, a stringent father, certainly like that - but also a lovable respect, to which they still perceive and honoring them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once more clearly, all that throws him are educational methods which were then on the agenda back then."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have overcome this time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust, a man, only because it is prominently and one more prominent brother to make a personal fall."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the evil intention behind it is, there is only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report which has just been released, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the lawyer would have acquired a 93-year-old man who had acquired big merits and without the outside of Bayerns, and perhaps Germany would probably know any of the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
