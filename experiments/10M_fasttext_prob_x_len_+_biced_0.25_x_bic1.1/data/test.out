Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston : I always put on drawers .
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
that made the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ understand@@ able now .
&quot; I always put on drawers , or receive from outside label , which have usually little to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself did not wish to have the wish , always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather schn@@ apps . &quot;
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that they are considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mopolit@@ an . &quot;
&quot; the actress enjoys the actress at home , pre@@ m television with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and Mexican food , is called it in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; to the Weiß@@ gl@@ ut , she is introducing the question about the wish of child : &quot; &quot; we must not be married , or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; says Hollywood star . &quot;

Gol@@ fer Lang@@ er receives the pil@@ es of pil@@ es
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf club in South Africa , Bernhard Lang@@ er was looking for a little variation with a ride on the beach . &quot;
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden ey@@ epi@@ eces &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered her holiday evening , they hun@@ ted in fast gal@@ lo@@ p to feed at home . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er . &quot;
and that ended the riding career so far .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament victories - back near horses .
he left his family with his family about the installation of the AL@@ RV , on a horse there was no photo for photography . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , making it also at CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was definitely convincing .
&quot; as part of a small gala , the German sports wrist@@ band gave up the man from An@@ hausen in a small gala . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t lack awards for the sympath@@ etic sport@@ s@@ men .
&quot; Federal Chancellor , Silver bay leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has kissed him .
a long is the 18th winner of the pyramid of pil@@ es .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize of Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means me a lot , &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; for it will not only be awarded for spor@@ tive successes but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lang@@ er promotes the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so , he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 more outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ fold US ma@@ stur@@ geon was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ des and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ uss@@ ani , Alexander P@@ ush and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jumping Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ ö@@ hle and pos@@ th@@ um of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard . &quot;
many of these sports cars arrived on Saturday to Aachen .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ative society of the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ ac@@ za price ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lang@@ er held clearance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP , both Clinton and Tr@@ ump wants to stop . &quot;
&quot; the two US presidential elections , however , are un@@ affected by the tax and energy policy , as well as in a basic demand . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton lies a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
&quot; of course , on the role of the state . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubt little in doubt , and warns that the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Clinton wants to auth@@ ori@@ ze and regulate the economy and regulate the economy . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , it would be quite different , reverse Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will return Reg@@ ulations massi@@ vely , and it becomes powerful tax rate with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to open , he has prepared the dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the wealthy would therefore be increased . &quot;
&quot; Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in which they must be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost wor@@ r@@ able . &quot;
the Democratic Can@@ didate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state @-@ owned investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are rejected by the state @-@ critical tea party of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; on Tr@@ ump , there may be part@@ isan discussions . &quot;
clear@@ er are the differences in energy and climate policies .
&quot; Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power stations , and to drive the coal transport in the USA . &quot;
&quot; oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas , to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies with its investment program and demands : &quot; a country will create clean energy , and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be there . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other .
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ ac@@ ia trade agreements , they want to sign both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of them want to is@@ olate international trade but just use American jobs . &quot;
it should then be paid better than Clinton demands .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hungry .
it wants to increase it to 15 USD per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage must be up , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months should probably be likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
&quot; on one hand side is Tr@@ ump , who wants to boost the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; its critics meet him , so that the budget deficit would have only bigger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to demand for the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
flight : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is one of women , who flee alone , almost daily for everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen four women sit on four women .
each has a baby that is not a year old .
one has put her little son in the arm .
he looks looking forward to the room with big eyes .
his mother starts up on the table top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk to Katrin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the Executive Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for women @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs created the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 females and 20 children .
there are no - not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated : every woman who arrives here , made experiences with sexual violence on their flight , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persecuted because of them torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as the hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; for women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away secretly , because they do not see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland they have gained experience with sexual violence , forced , honorary mor@@ den , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this continues her .
on the run this continues .
&quot; for example , they call for a bottle of water a sexual action , no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women alone are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe this , once they wander@@ ed in Germany , ir@@ re , tells us . &quot;
&quot; even here , single women in refugees would often be regarded as min@@ der@@ ers and worst if used . &quot;
&quot; this leads to the fact that about 90 per cent of women , who live in the Munich office in the Munich , estimates them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily developed . &quot;
many women are so acc@@ ust@@ omed to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the life , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; they often don &apos;t need to worry about , it only need more accommodation for them , called B@@ ahr . &quot;
Bavaria is the seven District governments in charge of refugees in charge of refugees .
&quot; to the question , whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their condition , some answers with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ p@@ fal@@ z and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are not something in accomod@@ ations of governments . &quot;
&quot; in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not sto@@ cked separately alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press @-@ pre@@ sidents of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , lower and medium @-@ fran@@ ken areas there are in some areas dedicated floors or their own houses for single @-@ standing women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodation only for women . &quot;
also the Committee &quot; Rights of the Women and Gender Equality &quot; committee in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a trial which has been published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy or men are lacking , men and women can be accommod@@ ated , it can come to - ongoing violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the shower room should be separately accessible , and can be easily accessible for women , in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this protection of protection , you can read the con@@ gest@@ ion that there is at the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since she has been talking about , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistant D@@ enti@@ sts : recei@@ v@@ ables after new working fighting measures
&quot; representatives of the assistance doctors have called to their union , to appro@@ ve new labour measures in any disp@@ utes concerning a new contract . &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded more workforce from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that the ministers would have ab@@ dic@@ ated to interv@@ ene on the concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , the BM@@ A agreement with BM@@ A has been agreed with the BM@@ A contract . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday night on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had been &quot; har@@ r@@ able quiet &quot; on issues , which led to the contract that the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; considering that the J@@ DC board has decided to rev@@ ise the proposed new contract and calls for all your concerns about the new contract . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board has set up a formal request for a specific meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a running program of fiscal measures that begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disp@@ utes led to the dispute that assistance doctors had six times , the first total fail@@ ures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the manager of the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , entered the terms of the agreed conditions of contra@@ ctual conditions that had been recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he divided BM@@ A members during meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants and medical students that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health and Health Hunt said that the contract for physicians in England would be compulsory . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and pro@@ claim an official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin wants to receive his Turkish counter@@ player in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara most wants them . &quot;
&quot; there was the pal@@ let , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles worked nar@@ ro@@ red , and it hardly felt warmth , even for its rest@@ rained conditions . &quot;
&quot; but Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , however , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
the next day the newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved so much better than never happened .
&quot; for me , his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable kitchen revealed that Russia &apos;s state of state had not forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of crisis was the first thing he mentioned in its introduc@@ tory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border by Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was w@@ asted .
Putin divided Putin and accused Ankara to fall in the back of Russia .
the Ver@@ ger was even bigger since it was committed by a supposed boy@@ friend .
re@@ building re@@ building will be difficult if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media carried out a sharp , restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; once , the Turks seemed to blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ations from senior officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in territories of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the accus@@ ation that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a way of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of an ar@@ mist@@ ice is clear at hand . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan is first and foremost all friends who can get after he was enth@@ ron@@ ed with a coup d &apos;@@ etat that he failed last month during a failed coup d &apos;@@ etat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular , the ban of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , it@@ iner@@ aries and charter companies will be facil@@ itated if the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght in the Mediterranean Sea .
this week forecast the state television cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish farm imports are allowed again .
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; tourists long , tomatoes are long here . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is ra@@ ging to the West as its reaction to which tried power to be weak in a weak response .
&quot; in addition , the continued gro@@ uting via the EU accession negotiations and Putin will come out to reduce the cooling benefits from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , Russian state of state won a bonus for that he requested a coup support for the elected state organs . &quot;
&quot; for Moscow , this is well @-@ noted for Moscow , that even a profound fear of regim@@ en has changed . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this glorious palace of the sea has enabled Russia and Turkey , an analy@@ st once described me as an analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of external side@@ ways &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate themselves from the west and are treated badly . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , between the two still big differences exist . &quot;
&quot; the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently announced the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support mutual sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours , the President had also said to the press conference , they did not even stri@@ ve the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey mi@@ ed it on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize this . &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sensus about where a common denomin@@ ator can be found on Syria .
&quot; but after months of host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , as NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian fight jet - it is certainly better to talk to the two state of state at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland not available for customers outside Scotland
the R@@ BS brand has to be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the bank head of the bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the Scotland Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
&quot; since then , the bank has since dist@@ anced itself almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; in this period , brand strateg@@ ist &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end users fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray . &quot;
but now she decided to put more national brands into the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland is only available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and stock ex@@ changes to Nat@@ west . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are others , smaller brands for the private customer business that will get more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was interviewed at a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he divided the Scotland Scotland with &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand &quot; &quot; to our Invest@@ ors &apos; brand and the brand , which will be employed by our employees , as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS was named as a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now I say that we do not track global goals , but local targets . &quot;
&quot; each of these stamps will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different , and our employees will work with the customers . &quot;
R@@ BS has already dealt with that it will no longer be continued by Six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the perception of various brands in his Sport @-@ Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop at the Bank of brands , as we are concentr@@ ating on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Board . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ically , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched this brand . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many modifications . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori met at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction its 3.@@ 000@@ th profit in New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spray champagne after a double at New@@ market , who brings him 3.@@ 000@@ th profit &quot;
Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3.@@ 000@@ th British profit in New@@ market on Friday .
&quot; he reli@@ es on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ char@@ ds , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ channel winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won before G@@ ha@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m very emotional , because my family is here too &quot;
I &apos;m very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; there is no big meeting , there is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I &apos;m reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the che@@ ers when he takes up the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ys achieved a milestone in obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached more than 4.@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the nin@@ ety D@@ erb@@ ysi@@ eger , had 4.@@ 4@@ 93 Kar@@ ri@@ er@@ ys@@ ers &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey in modern@@ ity , and it &apos;s no surprise that he achieved this milestone that only few before it reached . &quot;
&quot; it has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tic intel@@ le@@ ct that distingu@@ ishes him from the other in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm , and charis@@ ma fans have thr@@ illed fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie before a few weeks at Ep@@ s@@ om that he had already brought 6,000 win@@ nings , if he would not only be a weekend and Groß@@ tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey was ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already visited almost 30 years of winner what was great .
&quot; he has a lively personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the suspension of British flat racing for two decades . &quot;
it was annoying .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments winning , including his famous &quot; glorious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash , and received a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he initially had difficulties , when he returned from his six months lock , but he showed an impressive characterized strength to def@@ y his branch and to return to his best . &quot;
and he is still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori said before that he wants to continue working at competition up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years old .
Russian President Putin hum@@ ert Chief of Staff Serge@@ y IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V
Russian President Vladimir Putin did not expect to release his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the most eng@@ aging confidenti@@ ality of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport affairs .
&quot; in a statement of Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is said that Putin have ordered the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian President Department . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was the deputy chairman since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in the capital city , Tall@@ inn , he made his conclusion at the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked at the Tokyo &apos;s Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , it is ( in Russian ) that he later became the head of the head and head of the government . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin about his appointment , &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support its activities as head of state , and controls on the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
&quot; Putin announced the Russian TV station on Friday , that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V therefore asked to leave his position and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor . &quot;
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has taken mysteri@@ ously in Moscow .
&quot; Serge@@ y IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin &apos;s eng@@ agements as he works for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; in a meeting with President Putin who was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both men claimed that Chief of Staff came back on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the l@@ eness of the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the consequence of a kind of power combat ?
nobody knows that .
but the official claim - a man who once received as a potential president who would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to great sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
&quot; in his remarks on Putin that are cited on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V &quot; &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation with me this very complicated post - you could almost say - De@@ wer@@ ly post four years long . &quot;
&quot; as it turned out , I have been chairman of the Russian President &apos;s Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the state Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Chancellor &apos;s Federal Chanc@@ ell@@ ery ( FS@@ B ) , who was appointed K@@ GB , was appointed IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V as his deputy . &quot;
&quot; as Putin came to power he called IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V as one of five people , whom he trusted in most . &quot;
&quot; once it was believed that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V could become President of Russia , as a third term in Putin was viol@@ ated against the Constitution . &quot;

puzzle of fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a inhabitants of Ban@@ ff called for the identification of the fish help which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could deal with the 75 fish around San@@ da@@ ale that were sp@@ out by a fountain of fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released Per@@ is@@ cope a video of spectac@@ le in hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Queens@@ bor@@ Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
&quot; engineers have connected the north deck of the Queens@@ bury Cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct , which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe . &quot;
&quot; it is the first of four se@@ al@@ ings of the &quot; Deck blo@@ wer , &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
&quot; it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 sl@@ ings . &quot;
the sum of £ 1.@@ 35 billion is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; Keith Brown hosted a visit to the site today , and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queens@@ bury Cros@@ sings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses to a engineering with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel this project , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the closure of the lock between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a fin@@ ick@@ y activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; all in all , almost 79 % of all bri@@ cks at their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks get a concrete pit for the deck , which means the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a major milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the lock @-@ looking high@@ - and deep construction represents . &quot;
&quot; after installation of the last street @-@ section and its connection with the expansion of Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to then close the gap on the North or country side . &quot;
this was reached by pulling the northern asc@@ ending bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very fin@@ ick@@ y activity .
&quot; massive because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , about 6,000 tonnes , and an incl@@ ine of approximately 3 % had to be moved up . &quot;
&quot; he@@ ats , as the toler@@ ances , which the team works out , were tiny - on each side , they were only a few millimeters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have good luck to be alive &quot;
three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot; after being thrown away from her fishing boat ahead to Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station proposed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat was moving with their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw what the boat was around , turned around , and set us the worst thing , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have had the boat out apart from their range until we were added to water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and hung up in Bo@@ je without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they came on board the coastal area and were driven back to life station
&quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water were un@@ hurt and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the bo@@ ating engine had an emergency stop , however , in the case of the bo@@ ating of the boat from the person left , which controlled the boat . &quot;
someone is w@@ aking up today about these men .
seriously injured - man sti@@ fle on his ex @-@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and injured .
&quot; as the police lasted yesterday , the 50 year old had the key to the home to get his personal things . &quot;
instead of non @-@ alcoholic offen@@ ders the clothes of his ex @-@ friend instead .
&quot; when they came to the apartment , he sto@@ cked twice on them . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and on the body .
the police force the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ ar@@ ming then his sister .
&quot; together with her life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
&quot; however , she could not move it to leave the apartment . &quot;
&quot; therefore , she went out of the house with her life . &quot;
on the road they met the ex @-@ habitat of the man .
&quot; when both women stepped on the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old has left his sister to hand and hold his ex @-@ friend . &quot;
who is building Braun@@ schwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : investors are expected to be much stronger in the future .
how does one respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 inexpensive apartments in the coming years ?
the SPD proposes the next call for &quot; action @-@ concept &quot; .
yet argument is programmed .
the first line is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is so far .
&quot; Christoph Fr@@ mann , SPD faction leader , said : &quot; we are willing to build us with the Gre@@ ens , &quot; who wants to build a municipal surfaces in the future , must point 20 percent of all the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the favourable apartments can also arise in stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the large party in the town hall was , like the Brat@@ mann : &quot; how are you going to build up to private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent to such areas , but as possible as 20 per cent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing program , which will cost millions , will need to be paid for inc@@ enti@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the problem , the Brat@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors a few regulations as possible .
the Left is still responsible for investors .
&quot; regardless of his , like the Brat@@ mann , ba@@ the in the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; the concept of action is implemented , which will provide additional tasks in the building management . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will receive the specialists .
&quot; yet the program is not fully integrated : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should already be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you compare the loss of further 1,@@ 300 inexpensive apartments , whose adv@@ ancement will run out in the next few years ? &quot;
by 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments .
&quot; to prevent this , the policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the town &apos;s ongoing ties . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it would have to be thought that apartments are back in the price connection again . &quot;
this is possible in the West town .
one blow can solve this problem .
because in the West town there will be at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be able to get into the price connection for cheap apartments .
only : this is the owner who does not represent construction companies .
&quot; because the number of social housing has been dra@@ stically increased in the western city , one gets away from the goal of so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
a concentration of social guards in just a few districts is not to give it any more .
&quot; the Gre@@ ens thus reck@@ on , that there will be movement in discussion . &quot;
&quot; leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes , &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CDU with the boat must be . &quot;
the have been concentr@@ ating on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that a compromise may not be found yet .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , which is worth &quot;
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that teenagers and child does not go out for playing outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time to spend on screens , was den@@ ounced in the last decade of many . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go will therefore get to get people from the sofa and become more active .
&quot; the time at the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities do not exclu@@ de each other . &quot;
&quot; I take myself at the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon animation , cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) were created . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop@@ culture fell , in front of the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
&quot; market launch in other countries was moved through massive demand , which over@@ loaded the server . &quot;
&quot; within days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that were followed with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( via a screenshot of the mobile phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , the game led to a considerable increase in steps , that the &quot; average &quot; person goes back every day . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ di@@ ovascular , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35,000 users , announced the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed every day 30 minutes to 53 per cent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it looks only the raw data for increased output .
&quot; a lot of public recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance campaigns for health , people want to take about 30 minutes &quot; to come &quot; &quot; to come &quot; &quot; from the sofa , because many public messages are bo@@ red for health and come from people that look great . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly casts sports , reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open , that makes them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus three pillars of the health will be covered , movement , fresh air and sunshine . &quot;
some people close to hunting even new friends .
&quot; anyway , there are m@@ ür@@ rical toys that have to compl@@ ain about something . &quot;
&quot; yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
a breakthrough is suitable .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit has already been able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and use the use with the time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will join apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help people in the hunt , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ ns
forget the print .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all this immune system .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less to the bar .
breathtaking on the ground .
on full line brilliant .
and now the Olympic @-@ singer too .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast in er@@ om@@ m on Thursday to multi campaign and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world ahead of all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the American Simone Bal@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish bal@@ es during the promotion of women in the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who wins a multi @-@ election title and , in total , consoli@@ dating its reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; she broke out in tears , when her final score was shown and her long journey took place in this moment . &quot;
&quot; this success , she introduces in the same league as unique athletes as Michael P@@ helps , brought up their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; the last three years has dominated their sport art , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals , that won a mixture of amb@@ ition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she has ever seen &quot; the best tower , which I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was waiting for a final inspection in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of athletes , but rather , between it and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not to return with a hand@@ ful of gold back to family in Spring , Texas , would be viewed as dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace her , after they have won gold and silver in the individual combined events of women in the Olympic Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal at Tuesday , while she was at the farewell party of Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi for a retirement party . &quot;
&quot; even though it insi@@ sted on top , during their long way@@ point to the top , never to have planned the future , is that not really true . &quot;
a part of their floor exercises - which included her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is based on Latin American music that would match the country outside the Olympic arena outside the Olympic arena .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip in the gym@@ nast@@ ics , in which Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became force . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2013 , she has not lost a multi @-@ competition competition , winning a winning stre@@ wing , which is as long as it wishes . &quot;
even when Must@@ af@@ ina led slightly easily by two turns it sha@@ ved the picture .
Swedish bal@@ ks and Bo@@ ots - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Champion title - l@@ ur@@ ned .
she returned to the Swedish back with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the ground and replaced with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when she became her end@@ ition - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flo@@ cked on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in their collective book , to reality . &quot;
&quot; the achievement of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ ille went into a low level of Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year old male chapel had a lead over the Americans &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her soil , she cast down the public can@@ als , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of this week , in the beginning of this week , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old T@@ we@@ et has a completely new meaning : &quot;
police : 3 victims in series of series shot at a car in the car
&quot; according to the police report , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks in the first series of series of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and stopped listening to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th while the car was par@@ ked in a entrance , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators fired eight shots from a fire weapon , while on the passenger side of the car and fled afterwards with another vehicle , is reading in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police shared with that the triple murder could not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the att@@ ack@@ ers did not participate the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were involved in possession of an adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the polic@@ eman from Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting , led by investig@@ ators to become a closer look , whether it is associated with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , seven individuals were killed and two were injured in h@@ isp@@ anic gardens within four months in nine months . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects has several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to expos@@ e the evidence that they have been led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked up by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died out on site . &quot;
a witness shared the police that it was not unusual for them to sit and listen to music in a par@@ ked car .
&quot; the authorities also released a police report on the shooting , which was launched onto an empty Pick@@ up truck , half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and assumed that it was the plant &apos;s work . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat as well as spher@@ es from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 years , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to love the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; however , as the fe@@ west of his aging , Edmund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , knew about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I can &apos;t create it . &quot;
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let that .
&quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her was informed that Edmund can never recognize it under circumstances , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institutional him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Edmund can run a help with help .
Edmund could neither sit nor sli@@ t until his third year of life neither can he still speak .
but he always makes progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the language that Edmund for &quot; Please give me something before &quot; . &quot;
&quot; we bring it to him , &quot; says Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical character language -- it says . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ y has a multitude of causes : genetic as with Edmund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy . &quot;
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it is affecting the life of sp@@ ik@@ av@@ irus in@@ fest@@ ed .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she doesn &apos;t really know it yet .
&quot; I have been asked for a long time since long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me . &quot;
&quot; but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eless advice for the mothers of infants with birth , caused by the c@@ ic@@ av@@ irus . &quot;
it will get better .
they know that it will get better for you .
&quot; you will love your child , and your child will love you . &quot;

a flood warning system is used through large parts in the South Lou@@ isi@@ anas until Saturday .
the We@@ ather@@ Service sent un@@ mistak@@ able that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall to rain in this area .
&quot; in the south of Alabama , a flood @-@ early warning system was used on Friday , while the Mobile zone continued to rain . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ites near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite close to Den@@ ham Springs , which are both located in Louisiana , will get a record level of all the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood over the weekend . &quot;
the Met@@ ast@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could over@@ take many houses in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a stream @-@ down@@ ward floo@@ ding in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish is a danger , because these are only slowly flowing through the vast rivers into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the Tick@@ fa@@ w river , south of the Mississippi State Border at Liverpool , Louisiana , reached its highest level at 09.@@ 00 on Friday . &quot;
b@@ ail@@ out teams are still living in the Mississippi River Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the south @-@ west of Mississippi .

&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually located more than 400 feet from his house , overnight in excess of overnight . &quot;
he said that another step @-@ in @-@ son who lives near him would have been warned .
&quot; we are w@@ aking up and poured down the water and radi@@ ated in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she lived in the 48 years in which she lived there , never had seen such a blast of the river . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities , and he is the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said , that Not@@ hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood has spread rapidly rapidly , since it continues to be heavy rain , and that the authorities have to consider evacu@@ ation assign@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer was in the vicinity of Living@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil was fully properly nurs@@ ed through the rain@@ falls since Wednesday .
the authorities said that heavy rain@@ falls and street floods have caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and teaching in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a single @-@ flooded houses were ang@@ ulated in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 .
&quot; the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated into two churches , now both were over@@ flowing . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ ste@@ er of the church of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have been rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven animals , who were washed out of the flood . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were furnished to accommodate the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; once the water starts to rec@@ la@@ ze , they will return to their homes , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two dozens of roads were closed because of the flood and feeding sand@@ bags for residents to participate , which can hope to keep the water from their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the town administration . &quot;
this seems like a similar incident .
in a pp the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys said it would continue to rain on the Gulf Coast .
&quot; according to his information , a hand@@ ful of houses should be reported on Thursday than flooded , but was not reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per &apos;s F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water at places where I never saw it before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; carved by balls &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ving shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police reports that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time , that a 6 year old child will be shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .

&quot; he has made a lot , his little body had been extingu@@ ished by balls , &quot; shared his grandmother Del@@ o@@ res Mel@@ ende@@ z to the station . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the condition of the boys was critical in a hospital as critical and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter with that he is expected to recover again .
it should have started the first class in a local primary school .
&quot; Brown was one of four people , who were shot in German@@ town . &quot;
&quot; three men were also involved : two at the age of 29 , and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in the critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable state .
&quot; the boy was on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who was in a critical state , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police were just under one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cruci@@ fix@@ ion between multiple arch@@ ers .
&quot; patches for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced to different assault ri@@ fle , se@@ wed the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that it was clearly acted by an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the path , were found . &quot;
&quot; thus , there are several armed fighters to have been involved , which were very actively involved , &quot; divided police ch@@ es@@ p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest and the police check , according to reports , according to the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 year old girl was hit by a cross ra@@ cket on the arm when she played in front of her house in the area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
they are re@@ covering and the police are looking for a susp@@ ect .
why do we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I present myself in the gym@@ nast@@ ics in the gym@@ nast@@ ics and that from more than one reason .
firstly I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
&quot; and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ner@@ ves , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the cath@@ o@@ lics , round off , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team is finally reflected the US .
it has ver@@ ifies the black and Hisp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; over the last four years , number one was one of the female gym@@ na@@ o @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were available .
this is showing strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ad in America and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three fold world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as it unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ik@@ rout@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold for women with an individual multi @-@ battle event . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport species , but they do not see strength classes throughout the country . &quot;
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gym@@ n@@ uns in the crew . in addition , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as trainer . &quot;
&quot; but reality looks like being a more expensive sport and Turner will unite the first place in private gy@@ ms , which will be maintained by parents who will come up for training , setting , travel and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these gy@@ ms are in wealthy families who can support business .
&quot; in these verses , the Turner receives its entire training and that &apos;s a long @-@ term commitment to families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both her athletes since she started with the gym@@ nast@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired by the congregations of Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a great and easy @-@ to @-@ access control training . &quot;
I founded my Turn@@ son of 20 years ago .
&quot; for my events , we offer free and affordable gym@@ nast@@ ics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gym@@ nasium who earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gym@@ nast@@ ics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
&quot; this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health , training and professional success . &quot;
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , who will bring thousands of young girls to care for the gym@@ nasium and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is a so exciting time .
&quot; thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team of Team and thank you , F@@ ass are motivated to start their way to start a healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant doctors want to organize more strikes after promp@@ ted Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal
&quot; the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes due to the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 3@@ 7.000 assist@@ ants who vote for a choice . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt had revealed plans to disman@@ tle the contract and said that the N@@ HS had ordered in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assist@@ ants should maintain a new contract , which contains modifications to night and weekend work to improve care for intensive times . &quot;
&quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chair@@ woman of the BM@@ A Com@@ miss@@ ees to assist@@ ants distributed last night in a communication with : &quot; assist@@ ants &quot; agreed to the proposed agreement as before serious concerns , in particular that it will be able to meet all doctors . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks , who continue to stay until the first group of doctors must fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out . &quot;
&quot; efforts by the BM@@ A solution to resolve the disp@@ utes between talks and opposition to the government to participate , sometimes re@@ war@@ dly silence . &quot;
&quot; this was the case of speaking , the Jeremy Hunt first made it last month , that his door would always be off@@ ended . &quot;
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must act now , raising the vibration and address the concerns of assist@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; if he did not do this , the assistance systems have made it clear that they are ready to perform other labour measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13,000 rout@@ in@@ ations and 100,000 appointments , where nur@@ ses and doctors were included to grant doctors to the strip ette Dec@@ ision . &quot;
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes due to the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; BM@@ A wants to be a better day of week@@ days for the 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants which will be subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , CEO of the N@@ HS staff , urged the assist@@ ants to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour measures do not reach a little , but they have already loaded up teams and service providers and prepare for the patients , care and their families only concerns , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; over the past two months , we talked to the assist@@ ants , talked to the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Health as well as other minist@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; employers have hop@@ ed that the continuing positive commitment to other important topics - how to return , flexibility for training , training courses , mutual recognition of the teaching , advanced training , mutual recognition of the study , Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
&quot; the £ 2 per day - drug , which can reduce heart attack risks &quot;
thousands of heart attack patients are benef@@ iting from a £ 2 @-@ a day medication after the authorities recommended to submit this more people for a longer period .
the anti@@ ating drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the drug is given for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stro@@ kes or another heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long in@@ gest@@ ion to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long in@@ gest@@ ion to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of which suffer another heart attack or a stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by sei@@ z@@ ure of fatty materials in the arter@@ ies that make exposure layers .
&quot; when the layer falls apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that causes blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood cl@@ ots solve , it can flow through blood flow and blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who had already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots in@@ prob@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the lead bill of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month in@@ gest@@ ion of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg , with twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE Health Care Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all those who suffered a heart attack , a heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effective in reducing the heart attack and stro@@ kes in people who had already had a heart attack .
&quot; thanks to a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years . the lead design recommends no treatment that goes over this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the dis@@ miss@@ al of a government report because of corruption
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness led to that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities will be ignored as a devastating government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ austr@@ alia to have evidence of &quot; convic@@ tions concerning Eth@@ nie and Religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government , who is now a response of anti @-@ religious moti@@ ves , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of voters should be allowed to in@@ struct back@@ locks outside of elec@@ torate , to protect abras@@ ive voters outside the elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should lead a identification card to prove their identity , in order to prove their identity . &quot;
&quot; at present , a voters must call only his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not removable ink on the finger of a person , if they leave their sel@@ ective agree to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demands that the press should have access to community documents and decisions of non official comp@@ ees or working groups .
&quot; this is not only against electoral fraud , but should also protect the municipal government in front of the wider coral and financial aid culture that comes along . &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by the Do@@ wning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election campaign in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special court decided that the re@@ ig@@ ated Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man after a Lit@@ an@@ ei to corrupt and illegal practices of his Am@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feeling of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical manner , &quot; and that he had put his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bi@@ en@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man is meant to have led his campaign on the basis , that it is the cor@@ related duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of a im@@ itation , when someone cho@@ oses someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of the whole country of fraud .
he was especially al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent post@@ age - where older members of the Muslim community have made pressure on people to choose one candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the fe@@ eder of evidence to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report , it says : &quot; proof was appropriate that pressure on protection of some ethnic min@@ orities was exercised , especially women and young people , in particular to elect in accordance with the will of the elderly , especially communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ographic or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
there were concerns ... state institutions such a behaviour of &quot; politically correct &quot; sensiti@@ v@@ ities regarding the Eth@@ nie and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists refuse documents to stop &quot; &quot; reap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is drawn up by Ther@@ esa May , demands harder registration checks to prevent the election directory for immigration and social @-@ fraud purposes . &quot;
&quot; consider , voters think of choice after your identification . &quot;
&quot; do not use removable ink on the finger of a person , as soon as she gave her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
systematic review of the nationality of a person do to ensure that they are optional .
a 3 @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic post@@ code .
ban the political activists process complete correspondence and envel@@ opes from correspondence .
the police force the power to set out the bul@@ lock up stations .
&quot; a change of legislation , which facil@@ it@@ ates an indictment due to in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Convention Act 1983 ) . &quot;
photographer prohibited in election stations .
requirement that only in English may be used in the election stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fying the training , to ensure that the employees generally prevail that voters will go alone in the constitu@@ ent cabin . &quot;
Sir Eric falls about the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; ast@@ oun@@ ding &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was put forward .
&quot; the electoral tribunal provided Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy , because of a lit@@ an@@ ism to corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he is due to be guilty on the basis of the individual requirements in the criminal proceedings - due to the high requirements of the criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ controversial &quot; of the Rath@@ en@@ ets of the Rath@@ en@@ ets .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the trial in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country carries the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents a proud heritage , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and conce@@ aled spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger written and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympic champion in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have passed this week via the French cyclists Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot apart from edge and band that proved to be impressive as an imposing semi @-@ law in Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only to have gold fighting athl@@ ete who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not even if you give the social media faith .
&quot; in honor of the Rio Olympics in Rio and all the famous faces , which are running on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has made a lists to Olymp@@ ion@@ ic , which feature more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. crew in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates double @-@ law on the bike race , many people go on the Internet on how a certain ar@@ cher of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o might be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the U.S. crew in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a point on Twitter after images , on which he looks similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star in secret . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the she@@ ar@@ cher got the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave to hear that he has already been listening to his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity , except the facial hair@@ y , &quot; bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I can do it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be met at the centre : the striking simil@@ arity between the UK Wide Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris . &quot;
&quot; the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes should be passed to the Cuban American singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh , compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison . &quot;
a speed higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
&quot; another persistent comparison was pulled by the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and Ac@@ tor Jos@@ h , who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal winner in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sunny skin and blonde hair as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan had att@@ est@@ ates his fans to an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user had very happy that others are similar to the simil@@ ar@@ ities
&quot; put the theory in the room : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons of Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is nearly identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney , and the gold medal winner in the gym@@ nasium Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , wide sm@@ iles , resem@@ bles that of Bring It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

the comm@@ ent@@ ator of Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone is switched off when he flo@@ cked his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200 .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS on board , could hear more &quot; color , &quot; one could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;

viewers in Canada responded quickly online after they were sho@@ cked out of the tone and language
&quot; Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Did the C@@ BC comment just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old flo@@ ats made from China &quot; as a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot;

&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China has been described for women under the fin@@ alist 4 x 200m Fre@@ stylish swi@@ ms for women : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old chin@@ ese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter arrived fast and hard , with whom many were given to him &quot;
&quot; Twitter user did not keep back when they heard , as our en@@ si@@ bel Byron Mac@@ Donald &quot;
a different Twitter U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you are representing the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look all like R@@ assi@@ sts . # adjusted .
&quot; a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broad@@ cast@@ ed over a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate formulation , I &apos;m sorry that it is happening . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of over 90 times with the people that have answers on Twitter
the comm@@ ent@@ ator Scott Rus@@ sel had to make himself in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his accus@@ ation at more than 90 other Twitter users who have compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network has also reli@@ ed quickly and issued a message .
&quot; we regret it correctly , that these statements were made and that it was possible to broadcast them . &quot;
&quot; last night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed for our audience on show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media . &quot;
&quot; in order to declare one , Byron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless they were in@@ adequate and an un@@ fortunate formulation . Byron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark by telling them that it was not his intention to support them as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to exc@@ use me for the comment , which I made after the Women &apos;s swim in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m looking forward to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regarding was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark quali@@ fies on woman who under@@ wear under@@ wear in the middle of the business
&quot; the buyer did not know where they should see when a woman with@@ drew their clothes in the midst of a row , to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; for wor@@ sen@@ ing the situation , she p@@ atter@@ ned her as she looked in it and put it back to the shelf . &quot;
she continues and tried four pair of under@@ pants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place mall in Folk@@ estone .

&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who had been at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she went again and leaving her business without buying something . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , they took a pair of under@@ pants from the pool , moved their own stock@@ ings and tro@@ users and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she was not even trying to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she was simply there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; every star@@ chy when she went back the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like it , as they put it back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants , before she finally decided that her didn &apos;t liked to come back and out . &quot;
&quot; it didn &apos;t seem to inter@@ fere with someone watching - or to think about the person who would buy under@@ pants , who had tried them . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; How do they think that someone would have under@@ wear at home , who had a different person and had not been washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , added : &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to pull out the garments from selling , after she went - what &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants , to find out that another woman had her and pulled out and had not been washed . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the case that took place on Tuesday 9 August in our branch office in Folk@@ stone . &quot;

&quot; we talked with Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how one walks close to armed groups . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you a sk@@ e@@ wer for your pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; when you travel back from behind , then you should turn to the beginning , so you can take your att@@ ack@@ ers and go from the line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the gun between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him with the knee into the l@@ aces and twist the weapon before pain together , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the barrel and move back@@ wards , while holding the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; when att@@ ack@@ ers , who are approaching from the front , the technique is similar , move your body from the line , grab the weapon and twist it , so the att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , lay down the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ ack@@ ers onto the chest , then turn the weapon out of its handle before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon on him . &quot;
sounds easy ?

travel Information Ian Wright swe@@ ep for a guide to his tongue at the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller covered his immune system and Wür@@ od@@ ef@@ lex in a serious test - by ref@@ using some of the most dirty and un@@ ar@@ rests places of Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k scra@@ pped his course on a euro cord , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a washing kno@@ b of a train toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before removing any object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show and show us what he will let . &quot;
&quot; but this experiment , which was made under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the washing kno@@ cking of a train toilet which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in one kitchen . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright with doctors and medical professionals conducted over the promotion of Dar@@ mb@@ al bacteria as well as its own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left behind him that he had rejected , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by travelling around the world , specifically as well as wonderful things . &quot;
public funds to train stations until washing up r@@ ins@@ ets of toilets . the task assigned his immune system definitely under a sample
&quot; in film he told : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and slaugh@@ tering . &quot;
&quot; in the movie , he was definitely justified . &quot;
the only thing he refused to be a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ ofs showed a L@@ umin@@ ometer count of more than 4000 units .
&quot; in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ ometer count is less than 60 washed hands . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse , after their L@@ umin@@ ometer count was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot;
he says in the film he says : &quot; this comes the worst thing I smoked in a toilet .
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I will feel nothing here as it is inside .
the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company will equi@@ p Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumers really something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to watching and at the same time explained the advantages of Pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we were crazy flying colors that ended that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in health health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment that is associated with intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the director of the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him , like the ek@@ el@@ dest Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there was things easier where it was easier to bring Ian to live them , and others , with which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we have recorded some of these dirty treats on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all surveyed l@@ actic acid bacteria were associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they have at least occasionally products that contain mit@@ ig@@ or@@ ously bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destro@@ ys Del@@ og@@ ation social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a di@@ cial family left her social apartment after a del@@ og@@ ation of £ 50,000 because they had terr@@ orized its neighbors . &quot;
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock were cast after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after being removed from their property , sho@@ cked employees of housing cooperative houses the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls were scre@@ ened on , wooden trun@@ ks were set up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls . &quot;
the family res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation .
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she fears not to repair the apartment . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider as this estate is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ orious and her call is also available .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror , who had joined the family , had a street fighting with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ots , in@@ timi@@ date of residents , drug abuse , drug abuse and excessive scre@@ ams , stre@@ amed and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease contract , got a arrangement for ant@@ iso@@ cial behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; some rooms of the house , which will be demolished under conditions , has been found old rub@@ b@@ ish &quot;
&quot; in the property , in which the past drugs have been drugs , the wooden bra@@ ckets were sliced &quot;
neighbors said they were fighting them on the streets and regularly called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ated her and her partners this week violent by the estate after she extended them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntary .
del@@ og@@ ging were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They were ashamed . &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years along with them and it was always bad .
the countless times we can say the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning , we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - we are not familiar !
&quot; now , where they are gone , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family plans to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
on the washed side of the municipal house tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that the ten@@ ants may so@@ wed , to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family , as a delay is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult event , since the behavior was extremely difficult and their deeds for their neighbours had to be horri@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have gone to us and have done the information we have done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will don@@ ate a few neighbors , and con@@ veys the message that anti @-@ iso@@ cial behavior is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house but that they all were over 20 .
&quot; a dirty mattress , divided into one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ og@@ ation on the ground . &quot;
workers of the house management are now en@@ cir@@ cled by the land@@ mines that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g cannabis and Wa@@ agen , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es and cash at a height of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don won a fine penalty after being guilty of a drug of class B in trade sight .
&quot; they claimed that the money was a gra@@ vest@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came in 2013 at an automobile accident . &quot;
&quot; since they were without shelter , T@@ anya and their partners are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth . &quot;
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; the police states that they will del@@ ici@@ ate rent@@ ers , who are not holding the assignment . &quot;
&quot; Angela Cro@@ w , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall announced that the Del@@ og@@ ging is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that don &apos;t care about the assignment . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ alleg@@ ations , as well as to those who have been damaged by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and ant@@ iso@@ cial behavior that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal are transferred to panic after a ti@@ cking military jet beach
&quot; sunshine in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their life &quot;
a port@@ ug@@ isi@@ er P @-@ 3@@ C Orion aircraft in the Air Force took an unbelievable assault flight .
&quot; the air forces gave it on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no security risk was observed . &quot;
this was the moment when the sc@@ ary tourists start to get caught in panic after a ti@@ cking Jet passed over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military plane flew almost into tan@@ gible close to the sun@@ bathing area in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the holi@@ day@@ makers fell on , as they understand@@ ably began to do concerns about the noise of the bus@@ hes , without having to see what caused by the clouds to them . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers , told the videos about the dramatic fly by in the social media , said : &quot; it flew twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like this . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o arro@@ gan@@ ja , added : &quot; I just was at surfing and it felt so that the plane would fall down upon me . &quot;
&quot; tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were transferred in panic , when the plane came out of darkness and flew very deep . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast , so that this was the only possibility to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the speaker said that the Jet due to the bad visibility is slightly lower than usual , however , the air force insi@@ sted that safety at any time was endangered . &quot;
&quot; area fires have destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese land@@ lords , in which four people also came to death in Madeira . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese Air Force today gave the fact that the pilot had to fly as low due to the conditions - heavy fog and bran@@ dy - as deep as his vision , too . &quot;
the plane was found on a training flight which the pilot had to identify itself as part of the exercise .

coach Luis En@@ rique is present on a clear decision on this and left Bra@@ vo in the league but T@@ er Ste@@ gen takes place in most of the remaining applicants .
&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , there is a doubt about the fitness level of the team that was hum@@ bled on Saturday in a test match from Liverpool to 0 : 4 . &quot;
also at the 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ gi@@ al@@ opp Against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co . kg did not really convince .

&quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old inv@@ inci@@ ve his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; tit@@ le@@ holder &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4.4 ) &quot;
&quot; in this way , the World Cup winner won the &quot; Golden Grand Slam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and the Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ b@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected in the final game and made up one another .
&quot; thus , it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would take a single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic stadium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record alone , between sets and time @-@ outs , they had no co@@ aches . &quot;
they were withdrawn on the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their cont@@ ests in the fair competition alone .
&quot; I &apos;ve played the Mat@@ ches until now , played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang fol@@ ly said . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold medals and silver medal winner with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ il@@ ateral .
&quot; with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent , Ma was really fighting only in the first sentence . &quot;
afterwards he made the temp@@ o on the plate and left Z@@ hang down there only a total of 13 points .
due to the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma itself did not develop the expected share match .
but nevertheless they were enough to see a stunning balloon change .
Mi@@ b@@ ani won the play of bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in its quarter @-@ final against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov had pulled an infr@@ in@@ gement , was then in medical treatment , he had to &quot; end &quot; with sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; by the way , Sweden Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and J@@ ör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) had become a similarly high table tennis age . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump dreamed ″ huge problem ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the US rep@@ ublic@@ ans leadership is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , also in traditional states state states their majority . &quot;
&quot; presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave the weak@@ nesses of his election campaign in the previous republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds , Utah . &quot;
&quot; a more rare moment in which the normally large @-@ track and self @-@ confident m@@ ultim@@ atum was something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents as correspon@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; after he has thrown 16 rival to the race in his own Republican camp , the doubt grow on its success in the struggle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump told evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; wrong reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his famous media . &quot;
republi@@ can flood
Utah is normally a safe bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; a survey of Sur@@ vey@@ or from June , according to Tr@@ ump and his compet@@ itor in the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , were included . &quot;
&quot; other institutes may see tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that are common for Republican candidates in the state of the state . &quot;
&quot; as endangered , Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered . &quot;
&quot; in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answers to the question of how he would stop the invasion of Clin@@ ies : &quot; just as I did it until now . &quot;
&quot; and whether to be back : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make anything else to tell as &quot; the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it is not good for him at the end of reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is fine , Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
then I turned back to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party should have threat@@ ens Tr@@ ump to support their support for his election campaign , he should not present no better transformation values . &quot;
&quot; rather than what , the Can@@ aries of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans will take hold stronger than the poor . &quot;
Olympia : tri@@ bal fraud for D@@ oping Test
the IOC wants to set up a commission of disciplines .
Ken@@ yan athletes born after the second d@@ oping affair at the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a lack of engagement in a d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee agreed to set up an disciplinary committee immediately to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan functional function@@ ary communic@@ ated that the earlier Sprinter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village called a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ L@@ ists F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i . &quot;
this is the team@@ leader Ken@@ yan had been reported by D@@ oping @-@ Controller .
the IA@@ AF world association has searched the IOC for information about the case in order to strict his investigation as a IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC , the IA@@ AF will make a review , &quot; it was named in an IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the d@@ oping control station and has issued himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; said Ken@@ yan chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
he was in possession of the ac@@ credit@@ ation of athletes who stood on the list for the training session of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i had become more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before the Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics Deleg@@ ate Michael Rot@@ i had been drawn from the Rio Olympics .
he is alleged to have informed about cash payments in his country via the upcoming D@@ oping tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was reportedly arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC following a number of d@@ oping tests .
&quot; in the announcement of the IOC set out more than 2000 d@@ oping control session before the Rio Olympics , it was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken to the visor . &quot;
the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had a lot of pressure on African country in Brazil to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a working control system .
the law was just a few weeks before the Olympia @-@ beginning .
&quot; subsequently , the WA@@ DA Kenya adopted by the list of countries , with d@@ oping control , with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a major runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports , the ARD will always be imposed on accus@@ ations that in Kenya d@@ oping means are easily accessible and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of the sports club . &quot;
the IOC member Richard Po@@ und promp@@ ted a similar investigation into Kenya as he had been employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
&quot; in this sport area , it could be demonstrated in this sport area . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer meetings .
&quot; Salz@@ burger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in Shakespeare &apos;s premi@@ ère , the Salzburg Festival plays the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lovers couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical in the classic temple , and filled with the role of Mary a youth center . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted by the Venezuel@@ an conduc@@ tors Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their temp@@ o and their mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we actually have Bern@@ st@@ eins music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older one .
she rec@@ alls with melanchol@@ y to her mist@@ ress with Tony and she plays with the younger Mary .
the role of Mary always fascin@@ ated me .
first because it is exceptional !
and then Mary &apos;s personality is still there .
&quot; she tells her in her song : &quot; I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I , Pre@@ t@@ ty and White and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; it is so clever , of course also na@@ ive , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I bore to Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so honour for us to work with her .
she is a very generous man .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli is the compli@@ ment back : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an exceptional artist , very passionate ! &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in every of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather south temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , this is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ up : &quot; in this piece , it &apos;s about pre@@ ju@@ dice and fan@@ at@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; today , we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ cans have gone to New York , and the New York inhabitants didn &apos;t want to go . &quot;
&quot; these are the same issues , and they are just as powerful as it did . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
&quot; London &apos;s ma@@ ids , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British students who left London last year to join the IS , reportedly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ n@@ ime A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family experienced a few weeks ago from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was assumed that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the stron@@ gh@@ old of the group in the country , I@@ TV news on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the s@@ ult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after his family , shortly after she had prepared to leave the war carried away and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as admon@@ ition and warning to others that these are the risks that are linked to us to stop into a war zone - people will ever stop this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , the s@@ ult@@ ana and two other school maid came from the east of London in a plane to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
s@@ ult@@ anas family has been informed that they have married ISIS fighters in Syria - and has been a widow in a few months .

&quot; he praised Gar@@ land and said , &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s team wouldn &apos;t care for un@@ rest with a new candidate . &quot;
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia .

Tre@@ ats wants N@@ eck Calendar for Women and For Men
the Tre@@ ats magazine works together with photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to release an early 1970s Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked human beings they want to find the next generation of Top@@ models for 2017 .

I &apos;m doing this for women .
apparently he is the view that the calendar is doing .
&quot; we need to return to the representation of tim@@ eless and classical n@@ ud@@ ity , with which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release on the publication of the Cal@@ endars . &quot;
women will participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at open Cast@@ ing Call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish church reck@@ ons with mass cur@@ ses
&quot; he who does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the G@@ ülen @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the Kurdish town@@ ship of Germany reck@@ ons short term with tens of thousands of protection , from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term there might even be &quot; several hundred thousand , &quot; the consortium leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the severe procedures of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup attempt , Germany passed a mass cur@@ ses to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with a few hundred thousand protective seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime is fighting the min@@ orities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had survived Kurdish high bur@@ dens with pris@@ ons , including 500,000 Kurds in Turkey on the flight . &quot;
&quot; after the whi@@ sted p@@ utsch , the sec@@ ular and opposition to ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will start to re @-@ start in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state , who himself up refugees , produced refugees in their own country , said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Chief of Staff adopted the targeted establishment of Syrian Arab Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ ish cities . &quot;
thereby Erdo@@ gan would increase the exit status to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been cut off or driven into the last hundred years , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CDU member . &quot;
the ban on Chief asked that the Federal Government is in position as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers .
&quot; even in Germany , a &quot; &quot; wit@@ ch hunt &quot; &quot; was held against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
I feel no longer sure in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the G@@ ülen movement also feared the escape of many Turks .
&quot; more Turks will look for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition . &quot;
fire mark@@ eters as G@@ ülen supporters destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics in professional existence .
&quot; he who does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , the Kem@@ alist and sec@@ ular proletariat , &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , President of the G@@ ülen @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports on appeal to figures of the Federal Ministry of Ministers , the Turks had already reported the biggest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany because of political prosecution . &quot;
&quot; at the reporting date June 30 , this was 11.@@ 386 people and with just under 29 percent of all the vote have been granted ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , they are not found guilty before war , poverty or hom@@ tiv@@ e@@ pl@@ essness . &quot;
&quot; asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are politically , i.e. from state side , individually followed . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it is we@@ aving &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the loc@@ als get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia can not choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; until 2021 , the country code will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Swiss Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
because it is not until now it does not go : summer holidays ; heat and land@@ sc@@ ars - it bit@@ es .
&quot; the loc@@ als , who are to be convinced by the electoral soldier , are on holiday . &quot;
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers , who are on the country , are on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not a loc@@ als , so must not choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers that hang posters , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and arrange with the end voices , just need to cast out . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the electoral and last day of the day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to revi@@ ve an end to the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU . &quot;
how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D is exciting and what remains the end of the end of the end .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 of head of government , has an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees his major posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , spread ro@@ ses and p@@ ushes a little with the people , as it already did his legendary singer Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has gotten cold feet and ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the blame at the blo@@ om of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , &quot; &quot; We do &quot; &quot; have accelerated the &quot; &quot; ascension of the sp@@ o@@ ists &quot; &quot; which is probably going to cost him now . &quot;
&quot; the CDU with its peak candidates , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has experienced how it is when you make the right place to fight at the right place . &quot;
she has been invited twice in German Chancellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel German Bundestag hang@@ ings in the northeast .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Sax@@ on , Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other states , &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it too bad eman@@ eman@@ ate from other corners of Germany - Angela Merkel once again .
&quot; otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CDU does not abst@@ ain from market conditions for market places and shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , co@@ coon , play only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that you br@@ ittle the basis on the ground , that it must be very rig@@ orous to meet a wire back to people . &quot;
&quot; as on the left , it &apos;s like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , in the wind parts of the country hardly any . &quot;
&quot; however , the Council of the CDU electoral soldier Kok@@ ert to his fellow soldier is also self @-@ de@@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; you need to go where there are people : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because there is a lot on the game , Sell@@ ering has called for his SPD to an especially dedicated electoral campaign . &quot;
&quot; in the p@@ olls , S &amp; D Group finally accounts for 22 percent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and just under A@@ fr@@ o ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD gained some more than 3@@ 5.6 percent of the CDU ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party , with seven percent in the p@@ olls , create the leap into the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; they make a modern virtu@@ e from vac@@ ations , making their campaign set great on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; online electoral campaign , &quot; says the President Claudia Müller . &quot;
otherwise green elections go on track c@@ ens@@ orship after local stim@@ ulator among the vac@@ ations .
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top edge of the can@@ oe , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ ands of the lakes and also finds it beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : catering equipment suffer from blocking
&quot; in speed , with which the B 27 is san@@ iti@@ zed , there is nothing to compl@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; in charge of the construction of the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and at only 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there is always un@@ enth@@ used praise . &quot;
&quot; they made all pretty cr@@ un@@ chy , &quot; says El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ gas station . &quot;
that is a super@@ team .
there is no delay .
&quot; the construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south , scheduled to be moved to south until the end of October . &quot;
&quot; blessed is also the dispos@@ ition of those responsible for the construction work , about when it comes to the establishment of housing cru@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site moved to the south on Monday to the south and also the blocking of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen , and thus , the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has been restored , the transport situation is relaxed within the place . &quot;
citizens can now go back on both sides by O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
the so@@ fter traffic in the place seems back .
&quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; says the deputy chief officer Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach &apos;s road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight more traffic noise , because many ten@@ dencies were seeking to be trusted as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to that some truck stops in residential areas .
&quot; because the speed lim@@ ations were not kept , the municipality called for the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there was considerable dead@@ lines , &quot; says King , who made himself a location over the location . &quot;
two to three per minute have been sli@@ t .
the quick@@ est was on the road with 77 hours at the pace @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site continued , it became qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a little sol@@ ace that our customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open the road again .
&quot; in the cards , business@@ men do not hesitate . &quot;
&quot; however , that the B 27 @-@ renovation among them has led to sales in sales , everyone who asks to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customers &quot; means , i.e. , for other companies , the refurb@@ ishment has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks from a &quot; maximum light decline , &quot; but also a dream that &quot; of course &quot; is missing . &quot;
&quot; the city &apos;s most heavily poll@@ uted , the local street are on the road . &quot;
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öhn@@ er , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds great words . &quot;
that is already exist@@ ent .
&quot; not only it was , but all the guest houses I met &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
the sales in sales rose to &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
the street relief took his operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
he had to s@@ acked half of his employees .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt said on a request by G@@ öhn@@ er if there might be a financial compensation , otherwise it would be answered by the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now , they also have to give the dis@@ advantages that are caused by the renovation . &quot;
G@@ öhn@@ er knows of other coun@@ ties where something generous has been handled .
&quot; in all complaints , G@@ öhn@@ er is sure that his guest house will continue . &quot;
&quot; finally , the family business has been set up since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; if other regul@@ ars are frequently visited due to the complicated transportation of traffic , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t get ready , it is elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; his pedi@@ gre@@ ent@@ el returns to the end of the renovation work , G@@ öhn@@ er has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises of BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öhn@@ er holds the effects of the B 27 construction on his clientele for the largest crisis , which has experienced its suburbs in its long @-@ time history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
the terror control of laws in the name of the terror control is constantly stri@@ ving .
&quot; according to recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick safety package . &quot;
but what has a deficit status to do with Terror ?
and what does the coalition partner tell all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
&quot; all his proposals are entitled to the coalition partner &quot; politically , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Federal Minister at the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they are calling for anyone .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; also , I have been remin@@ ded of this . &quot;
but as interior minister it was located on results and on a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the Coalition .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère brought a little time according to the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach before completing his conclusions for the safety of the republic .
&quot; however , these are all the more extensive . &quot;
&quot; some is already known , announced and announced : that a new security authority should not care for the packing , is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU standards on air passenger data and arms .
the reputation after more video surveillance and staff for security authorities are also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will not start a second stop for proposals who have not been to do with the SPD : he wants to put up sympath@@ etic to terror groups under penalty and put jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be tough points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; the CDU man dreamed . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he still keep this for reasonable and demanding nothing that has no chances in the coalition partner . &quot;
a few new ideas will present de Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
they are partly in itself : he is planning a quick procedure for deportation and more possibilities for detention of people prior to deportation .
&quot; in advance , refugees and social media accounts for a security check in advance are to be taken to the country before they are brought into the country . &quot;
&quot; at Dul@@ ce for deduc@@ ting asylum seek@@ ers , he wants some even worse than ever - such , off@@ ences and their papers consci@@ ously throwing away their identity . &quot;
a lot of this is politically and legal hei@@ g@@ hness .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and leaves questions openly .
&quot; and with some points - at the im@@ balance of thought , for example - the question arises : what does it actually mean to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the themes of refugees and terror . &quot;
&quot; but it can &apos;t be put in speech , that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many people were worried about security for the high number of refugees . &quot;
&quot; and things that were employed by people , they didn &apos;t let go out in election campaign times . &quot;
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
&quot; the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the in@@ security is great .
&quot; and yes , there are choice fights . &quot;
&quot; Union and SPD are increasingly difficult in the issue of internal security , and increasingly in position . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the two parties went high between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ den@@ ier argument over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of several Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the Ress@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also require a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also here to reconc@@ ile notes .
and he leaves nothing from a return of double @-@ pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
&quot; to be new , be not useful . &quot;
&quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he did a constitutional concerns . &quot;
&quot; whether his own package is constitu@@ ent on every corner , and whether it actually is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it must only be shown . &quot;
there is quite a lot of things to worry about dispute .
yet the SPD is currently attemp@@ ting to pro@@ claim the issue of internal security .
&quot; party chief Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes a very careful conversation and says , &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security of security . &quot;
even Volkswagen is still pending .
&quot; in spite of diesel and@@ als , the shipping costs are sold worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs .
&quot; with the call @-@ call , there is a vort@@ ex for a term . &quot;
Volkswagen launches the deliveries of deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; in the previous year , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest passenger car can further show a further increase in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the core brand VW became weaker VW , especially in Western Europe and thereby bearing the total sale , as shown in the Da@@ x not@@ ated company . &quot;
&quot; in July , the brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars of 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , sales of the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries increased by almost one @-@ sixth . &quot;
brand leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July particularly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , there have been a shopping post@@ ure in some core markets with &quot; altered economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , British vote on the outlet fell from the EU , explained a female speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the US , where exhaust gas is escal@@ ating first , also a Min@@ us is on be@@ ech . &quot;
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; overall , the primarily affected house brand of the Lower Saxony is continuing in connection with the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , merely an output minus of 0.9 percent is to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler continued to report a sales plan from January to July . &quot;
&quot; in this period , Volkswagen provided more than 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software package .
&quot; in Germany alone , Volkswagen is calling about 2.5 million wag@@ ons to re@@ armament in workshops . &quot;
&quot; in re@@ armament , Volkswagen re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after re@@ armament of vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance . &quot;
&quot; the motorway exit to the customer after the change@@ over a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in the company &apos;s business . &quot;
cause : legal del@@ ici@@ encies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; reported that Volkswagen has granted its German customers a guarantee for new diesel models . &quot;
this would have confirmed the last Monday VW @-@ Represent@@ atives in the Federal State Department last Monday .
&quot; from the Department of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; VW has completed the editions of my inquiry for the Commission and the KBA task . &quot;
&quot; variations of these are not accepted , &quot; Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance , after the conversion , no deterior@@ ations will take place , and all type of approved vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in business districts .
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers will come into a workshop for example a year after conversion to a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that there are any other damages at any extent that have nothing to do with the sc@@ ass@@ ment sc@@ andal , to safegu@@ arding any warranty conditions as it was . &quot;
therefore VW is not using the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund in the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands great savings in the future - as the second Institute in Germany .
&quot; on Thursday , bank head Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers that park 40 million euros on gyp@@ sum or day money . &quot;
the German bank of German banks speaks of an accident and does not see a signal : normal savings should not be afraid to pay for their austerity penalty .
&quot; banks money over night in the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you have to pay 0.4 per cent pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund in September of Private and Corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros in Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost € 400 in the year , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; he le@@ av@@ ed the amount of 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day on the other , and that could not be missed . &quot;
&quot; those are located on the central bank account , and account for 0.4 per cent , &quot; said the banker . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot;
the cost he goes on after the exit principle .
&quot; the cash is easy to leave in the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four cases , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the banker . &quot;
most customers have understanding and changed to other assets .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative federation of Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of ECB caused considerable cost at all banks . &quot;
&quot; you alone can bear , be &quot; operational permanently not possible . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank Al@@ ten@@ burg country made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect to pay a nationwide dis@@ covers for deposits , in addition to the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a banker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client , which is a little more luxuri@@ ant from the fortune . &quot;
&quot; that can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; if you ski@@ pped them for free . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ah @-@ E@@ ilers , Cre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region , actors , sport@@ s@@ men and entrepreneurs live . &quot;
&quot; under the cooperative federation of Bavaria , there are currently no further banks known to charge an payout percentage for deposits of private clients , &quot; spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ ender ( BvR ) , Uwe Frö@@ hlich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold , into the negatives , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition is hard , and it threatening mig@@ r@@ ations of investors to the competition . &quot;
customers in Germany are not allowed to please in the width .
destination sl@@ abs : who can actually buy records ?
lon@@ ely men middle age love plates .
&quot; before you come to the commentary parts , in order to ski@@ p him under the p@@ seudonym non @-@ aging , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ development of records of records are not on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the real@@ ities of physical objects , but due to mid @-@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
&quot; those who recently bought a plate recently , are in the age between 45 and 54 . &quot;
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most prob@@ able K@@ äu@@ ge group .
there is also no hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older plate drivers keep their feelings rather to spend ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy road in So@@ ho run , a modest grey suit , before I stand , my hands hold and some determin@@ ants such as : &quot; so , let &apos;s throw at a closer look . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s throw at a glance . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slow at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers are based - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; I would ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various males in such shops and try to estimate their age and minds through observation . &quot;
&quot; Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I spoke of Sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle age ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops in order to fill a few hours . &quot;
is he a collector ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; this sound plate , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot per e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed by it ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such significant number of albums and singles , the result of his available income is : it is now able to buy records , which he could not afford to buy and re @-@ selling items he sold when he was young and ple@@ xed . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late &apos; 60s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s true to those who buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted , and likes to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot; &quot;
this is my truck .
&quot; We@@ z , 25 , who is working with Sister Ray , believes many customers that he meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about com@@ eback and to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; of the conversations I have led , people usually have insul@@ ted their collection in the rule of 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers that once sold their records in order to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of sl@@ abs ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a shop , like Ph@@ onica , to realise that record shops offers a so@@ othing community of equal opportunities . &quot;
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers joined the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world , and would like to withdraw into the stability of tru@@ sty tracks , of objects which watch happy ju@@ x@@ der@@ ange@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; I think it can be the col@@ t of a void , or possession of material owners as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
that is with me as collectors so and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to deal spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; sol@@ dered a staff of one plate stack .
&quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , they haven &apos;t heard it yet . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a turn@@ tables that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; at that time of the news report , I would probably look very worried , while I blo@@ ws the stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Kom@@ kam@@ i . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle age ) works , has a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone came out recently here and said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ tables , but I would like to buy a radio head record that I can put it into the shelf . &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musician . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not elderly , who will start slowly . &quot;
&quot; opp , which has devoted the sound of records almost a whole floor , has a b@@ entertaining audience when I am clean . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists , the photos , te@@ ens and middle ages . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest Syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ ist pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ans from the speakers - is it good to see such diversity in the customers .
&quot; none of them looks terrible , but na@@ iling psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are badly det@@ ectable , if one stands next to someone for about 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; El@@ an@@ ora , 27 , has been running around in the business for a few minutes , looking at the premises of the sale . &quot;
it rather makes a man@@ ne@@ quin to buy a large shopping cart@@ on .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore the collecting of records does not contain real option , says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or to another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a de@@ arest sigh@@ ing . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a shop , which is said that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I admit to gra@@ ze the je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ pants , I observe a group of young girls who are group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Cro@@ sley plate player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a blend of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only pure decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record @-@ art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction to these items mean more money to the industry and send some customers to the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about compl@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , even the one that is the most suitable for luxury objects such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave at least in record shops in So@@ ho , the large number of female collectors and record lovers , which exist in reality , record shops and in On@@ line@@ for@@ en exist . &quot;
these people are probably working hard in school or offices .
&quot; they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with safety by turn@@ outs at Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they abst@@ ain from the star@@ ry view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false host who rises above the shoulders of middle age . &quot;

&quot; a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of pro@@ vis@@ ory shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that the state should be fug@@ itive to selling 72 Pro@@ visional shops in which persons within the camp goods , from cigarettes to Energ@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dresser &apos;s services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ vis@@ ory restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places would be broken down because they would be a parallel economy that would not be paid out of taxes , and the risk of fire and san@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals that supported by the government supported association and other groups , will not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot;
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 temporary business , but admitted that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture are absolutely tra@@ ce@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes , and restaurants would play a much bigger role as people live , who live in extremely pre@@ con@@ ical conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of tran@@ qui@@ l meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the Netherlands was the Jungle Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is generally operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation about asylum seek@@ ers for hundreds of protection need , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; over 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the pet@@ ition to uph@@ old the kids &apos; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure would be a disaster for those children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;
&quot; the two aux@@ iliary organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants inv@@ ents on Friday that the number of migrants have risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ers in the course of the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin remains fierce
&quot; despite his dis@@ appo@@ inting performance at the Olympic Time , Rad@@ prof@@ i didn &apos;t want to leave Tony Martin . &quot;
&quot; I continue to keep the World Cup at a glance , remain confident and fighting continues , &quot; wrote the 31 year old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar hat .
&quot; to me it &apos;s honest , difficult to comment the time from yesterday , &quot; &quot; Martin said . &quot;
he had to analyse and analyze the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
&quot; at the time of the F@@ ahr World Cup in Qatar , Martin would actually wanted to fight with the title . &quot;
I will look at all exactly what we have changed in the last time .

here comes the en@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must set itself to the next generation speed of speed : in various federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new lighten@@ ing machines will be tested particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the fut@@ ur@@ istic @-@ acting en@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used for an accident on accident areas where the police would be too dangerous . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary speed , there are often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary bl@@ ender for compliance with speed limit . &quot;
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or co@@ stly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days in un@@ interrupted measuring mode ; the case data are encrypted via a modem .
&quot; with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be detected simultaneously through several tracks . &quot;
&quot; variable speed lim@@ it@@ ches , as well as driving force to time , driving strips and vehicle class can also monitor . &quot;
&quot; in the high @-@ driven state , one can move the trailer with each car with a trailer hook . &quot;
&quot; by the way , it is not simply sto@@ wed , it is lowered by measuring mode , so the wheels in the arm@@ oured , and by the way , van@@ ish @-@ proof outer cover . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is supposed to protect the bl@@ itzer against V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and meanwhile also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities fl@@ ashes with the new technique : recently , France has reduced 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain cat@@ ches silver in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by after Fiji Master@@ class Gold
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by arrived in the final on Thursday night at a dis@@ rup@@ ted stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ orus stage here . &quot;
&quot; in Fiji , a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , rever@@ ting , line @-@ up and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic ame@@ da@@ ille any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was won by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - the Great Britain &apos;s fourth on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament that they could be proud in New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the distinct defeat of the bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall in the final . &quot;
but in this form a 15 @-@ man team had been beaten in the shape of this form .
it could be a sol@@ ace for GB - but it will probably not be - that at least a br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chef Ben Ryan , former chef for England from Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult way behind him .
she lost eight years ago with Ryan every game at Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
they are just lost one here .
&quot; this fl@@ ap will aw@@ aken , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
in Fiji wonderful and dismissed the GB@@ S out of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , as one would walk in driving co@@ aches . the World Series winners left 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au moved up in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner of which he walked . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hard to fix the ball .
&quot; a high priest of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third gate , but it only stopped in Fiji . &quot;
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a left a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still more than one minute time playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u put a further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion took a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is as if Fiji had been born in Fiji , to play 7 , while GB is still not included . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB introduced basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova had gone through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan N@@ ort@@ on started a study of GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran long in favour of the South Korean Con@@ sul@@ s , whose fans sn@@ akes , flags , and dancing at the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame used the i @-@ bags with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the fi@@ f@@ l sounds , the fi@@ f@@ is re@@ arm@@ oured and the GB cr@@ ushing defeat in the lawn . &quot;
&quot; earlier in the days , Fiji had defeated 20 @-@ 5 in a semi @-@ final in the semi@@ finals of South Africa in a tight semi @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the board in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on passed through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling Marcus Watson , brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through the fighting with the cancer of the Train@@ ers to the rowing victory
there will be no more bic@@ ent@@ less gold than with these games and what will be called .
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder up to the last , 220 hard H@@ ie@@ ve , who go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though there were only the appl@@ ause , who were sitting at the rest , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of train@@ ers Robin Williams , was omni@@ present as they took part for the second Olympics in a row without tax wife , the first women in the history of the British Sports that laid out such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all their 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ locked deployment , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins , which reflects on the surface with the elegance of vibration , which is not reflected the kind of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es to ge@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the rowing , a bat@@ a@@ illon should contribute to the content that make the difference and there was no one more hel@@ pless than the coach who would not even survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had the bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did so . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads anywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather aw@@ ful situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside season , could begin the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the correct term in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , therefore it had to be better again soon . &quot;
it was an inc@@ entive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the rowing is already a challenge , but it makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ visibility of victory , their first thoughts went on Williams who spent a more annoying tomorrow to speak more than anything else and thus trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning that was in action as captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regim@@ ent in an use in Afghanistan , &quot; I was a emotional wreck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it just repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Helen and even Robin worked as well . &quot;
we were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks go to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I could not have a better person for coaching or better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning didn &apos;t have any race over the last five years .
&quot; the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponent could not keep up . &quot;
&quot; even in the last 500 meters when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , lead in the process . &quot;
it really is important to get rid of it .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to make something T@@ oll@@ es .
&quot; today we wanted no fireworks , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
&quot; the couple will take off for a year , before making decisions about his future . &quot;
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , with their own TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to realize that I &apos;m an Olympic @-@ singer . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
for 31 years is exempl@@ ary for clarity
&quot; the general manager of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ Group &quot; , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , reti@@ re . &quot;
the association is considered &quot; Bavaria far exempl@@ ary . &quot;
a small French drinking water @-@ purpose chair as a model for the big water producers .
so there was a lot of time in the original original part of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk &apos;s contribution .
&quot; a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ ks launched the purpose of the purpose . &quot;
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ Group landed &quot; Bavaria far as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was employed 31 years in the Zwe@@ ck@@ federation , 28 years as the manager . &quot;
&quot; now , he was reti@@ re at the age of 65 . &quot;
&quot; the pot@@ able water @-@ purpose association with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , Municip@@ ality Breit@@ brunn , promotes about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water and provides 32 places and ham@@ let with around 5500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member churches are church , church , Breit@@ brunn and Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply agreements for more cities and communities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d B@@ ühl ( FW ) , remin@@ ded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller 1985 was set as a water@@ bed and was appointed as the general manager of the Pur@@ ge Association in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; its tasks are very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organis@@ ational skills , the budget instructions , calculation of fees and posts up to emergency par@@ agra@@ phs at weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an exceptional events she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new foun@@ tains ( 1994 ) , land @-@ piece of land in the area of the new foun@@ tains ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the development of a central computer control ( 1999 ) , and the development of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) . &quot;
&quot; there was no stand@@ still , and I have always added new features because water life may cover and drinking water the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their foli@@ age , they praised G@@ ö@@ ll@@ ers , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he used a lot of heart @-@ purpose for its water @-@ purpose , and he has lived the water @-@ purpose federation there would be his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he considered a real practition@@ er to present the success of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ ment Group to the nit@@ rate of the Lower Fran@@ ks District . &quot;
he received a lot of recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller too , gave his fi@@ anc@@ ee Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best Aqu@@ wart and he was a loyal Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his point of view he called the Brun@@ n@@ tic@@ ulture and the re@@ organisation of the purpose of the purpose .
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were the pi@@ ping at the high reservoir in Kirch@@ no@@ a on January 3rd . &quot;
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages have to be supplied with water .
&quot; the supply of Neu@@ brunn was also allowed to interv@@ ene only once , because one filled the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with sl@@ ur@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; the management of the pot@@ able water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , which joins the successor of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;
&quot; the Sop@@ rano Anna Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko is openly concerned with the Aut@@ ism of her son Ti@@ ago , and addressed to other injured parents : &quot; you have to have courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; the medicine made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Sera . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , they believed that they should die . &quot;
&quot; but the now eight @-@ year old Ti@@ ago had come back@@ wards and learn privately in New York , where there is the best therap@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; to give an example : if I ask him something I sang for two years , when I sang on the Milan Scala , he reminds himself of nothing , &quot; &quot; said Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko . &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man p@@ ushes for life @-@ dangerous
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man on Friday arrived at a multi @-@ family home in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and fatal .
&quot; the man called himself by us and given him to have shot his life companion , &quot; said a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators was on the escape , and after him will be publicly tra@@ ced . &quot;
meanwhile Sven S. could be on the road by car .
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters in size , muscular , brown , and has a glass . &quot;
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
meanwhile the man carries a Gl@@ at@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could carry the weapon to wear , like the police . &quot;
&quot; if you see Sven S. , the 110 is calling . &quot;
the police speaks of an &quot; Association &quot; Association .
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the competent police in Nashville initially wanted to do no information about the ather@@ gang , or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a man was killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing system . &quot;
&quot; we do not say , &quot; &quot; said a polic@@ eman in the Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to the ye@@ witnesses , a Spezial@@ einsatz@@ komm@@ ando ( SEK ) was present at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - light view for German steel industry
the ris@@ ky and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains un@@ poll@@ uted by additional costs in millions of millions .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens , which threatened the industry from the green power promotion , are the table . &quot;
&quot; in the liberation of the renewable energy sources , the Federal Minister of Agriculture Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the German Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West German General Newspaper &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really glad that we finally could finally reach after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission initially planned to ensure the steel producer , the gases from the high oven to power generation for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry , the steel industry expanded additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ : there is now a basic agreement with the EU Commission following discussions with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
&quot; only if the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent must be replaced . &quot;
but this also will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission to qualify .
&quot; with this , the status quo in the previous regulation was made largely fixed . &quot;
Gabriel makes special meaning of Gabriel &apos;s successful jum@@ per for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel , the future &apos; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the reform of the emission just@@ ification , climate and employment goals are de@@ posed , IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis of 2008 , the steel industry in Europe has suffered under over@@ capacity and substantial price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation intensi@@ fied further than the world &apos;s largest producer of China in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand , in view of the global demand . &quot;
European Manufac@@ turers throw chin@@ ese stainless steel concerts .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has relaxed . &quot;
&quot; for one instance , import tari@@ ffs on imported steel effect , for others , the economic outlook in China have set up . &quot;
&quot; un@@ clear , how sustainable the pricing is . &quot;
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained c@@ auti@@ ous on Thursday .
and last the prices could be stag@@ n@@ ated .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also did not want to exclu@@ de any of the works of individual works .
&quot; at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel manufacturers remain c@@ auti@@ ous despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less steel than in the previous year , as the economic re@@ unification took place on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the set amount now returned to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is about two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; due to an improved order situation , the association expects an increasing order situation in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : sing for seniors good &quot;
&quot; Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teaching study she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings for a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , merry and more living , she says . &quot;
&quot; very next door , she does good with her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; for singing , there is a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Senior League . &quot;
&quot; most seniors sing in choir , sharing the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; by regular mer@@ ging , elderly social contacts can bind and maintain . &quot;
&quot; as frequently , social and famili@@ al structures occur at the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has made a pri@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to arrange and organise themselves , to be able to leave the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of coll@@ age . &quot;
&quot; can sing in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler writes . &quot;
because they exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; whoever calls his lung regularly , is not so fast in everyday use as fast as the pu@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; even if it comes to get the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains them . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently observed that singing , or hearing songs in elderly people many memories are ar@@ ous@@ ed , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through Lie@@ d@@ tex@@ te and particularly melo@@ dies , people have de@@ pressed people against long @-@ present events . &quot;
&quot; in case of singing , a special achievement is required , L@@ enz explains . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focus on their own voice and to concentrate on a set rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that &apos;s a major cogn@@ itive challenge . &quot;
&quot; elderly people who live alone , do not just practice themselves on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one drives by singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler writes . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is also growing by singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I do a bit of something , I will feel better and grow beyond me - that experience . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with singing , so there &apos;s enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try a new hobby , do not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent is advis@@ able . &quot;
&quot; not you are singing alone - at 50 sin@@ king people , who is listening to , if a tone is going on it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the appropriate offer , seniors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
someone sings from the well @-@ known circle in a geri@@ at@@ ench@@ es@@ or can easily be connected .
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
&quot; whoever wants to sing in a church choir can be addressed directly to the church or church rulers . &quot;
many senior managers are also found on the Internet .
&quot; if you have no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the Internet . &quot;
&quot; whoever wishes to sing , should make sure to join a choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this applies to any age .

&quot; to her surprise , the males did not leave the male too cold - but they kept the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats may recognize the rainy day of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on the se@@ wing of the little ones .
&quot; they react to ten percent faster on kit@@ ten by K@@ itt@@ ens who were interested in great distress , such as scientists from the Veter@@ ary School and Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
hang@@ over also react to the k@@ itt@@ ens of K@@ itt@@ ens - however .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently , the acoustic differences between the shr@@ ub of less and severely affected young for the males either are not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; she is the first author of the study , which was published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the K@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams distingu@@ ishes with the impact of their help . &quot;
&quot; overall , nine adult male and eight cro@@ ws were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; they were played for a loop of little ones , taken up for three minutes from the litter box and separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; to others , they were faced with Schrei@@ ers of stronger imag@@ ined kit@@ ten that were lifted up . &quot;
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample for seas@@ oned .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet their own offspring , responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; they turned faster to the speaker , when this rowing of the very rainy kit@@ ten played . &quot;
this ability may be born or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men in baby sounds . &quot;
some studies showed that women had acted sensitive to infants regardless of whether they were pregnant or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r . &quot;
he was accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match will take place in Turkey . &quot;
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
&quot; already in July , the government &apos;s suspension of acceptance after the revolution attempt in July should not be imp@@ aired by a standardi@@ zation policy . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who , as suspected , to be the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ülen , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
also before the football do not stop .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
&quot; accordingly , the South America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group in the Americas . &quot;
Sü@@ k@@ r allegedly is urged as followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ülen which is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; although initially for 90 days , the exceptional circumstances was still valid until October , but in fact it has no effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
the &quot; democracy guards &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday .
the sport is - like all the country - split followers and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; traditionally , fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are not amongst the friends of the president . &quot;
&quot; but what the Turks , however , insi@@ sted with dramatic experiences in history , the strict de@@ jection of military coup is stri@@ ving . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beat the Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ic@@ tas .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ sieg@@ er &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be very successful again to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in its sporty value , the Kölner presented its sporty value in the past season : with 17 fools and nine templates in all competitors , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of its association . &quot;
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 winning character .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atics &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in place . &quot;
he has finished the season in an excellent way and secured his cup into poker .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season took a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; went out too early in the Europe League . &quot;
&quot; in the South of Li@@ g , it was only limited to sixth place . &quot;
the season was not good .
Pok@@ al was the only way to win something .
&quot; we made it and that is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ic@@ tas the game year was better .
&quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who hit the season with 26 season of season as the sweet @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ g@@ ö@@ nig was the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return on the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; in doing so , during the AC Florence , the St@@ ik@@ tas had announced only a rented Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after its EM vacation . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; k@@ icker &quot; club chief F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; but it would have to be willing to aband@@ on some one @-@ third of his EUR 7.5 million of an estimated annual salary , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; its salary at Florence can &apos;t pay . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite d@@ oping : these athletes still have medals chances at Olympia , Rio &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ om in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa must not start in Rio .
others exagger@@ ated Athle@@ tics sin@@ ner can only laugh - they fight in Rio around medals .
the theme D@@ oping is determined by the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics Games .
&quot; the Russian wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who had met her starting right shortly before the games , was caught in her start ( 100 metres chest ) with her start ( 100 meter chest ) . &quot;
&quot; it was a whi@@ m@@ ile scene : with a super@@ visor sm@@ iles , she was proud in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; when it was fixed , that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a j@@ ub@@ el@@ tower . &quot;
but there are numerous other athletes who go to the Rio Olympics despite d@@ oping the past .
here is an overview :
&quot; Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was imprisoned for two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; the Olympic champion of 2004 and Ex @-@ world champion has been running even faster than before , he is the number one in the world and is considered the greatest chall@@ enger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t in 9.@@ 80 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to sit on a six @-@ month lock after taking the pain by oxy@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended her , defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disc@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 and European Championship was tested positively on the prohibited Stim@@ ul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the in@@ ex@@ cess@@ ary in@@ gest@@ ion and was j@@ ailed for six months .
the four most broad@@ est throws this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ ors .
&quot; La@@ Shawn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two times world champion over 400 m , was tested in 2010 and had been closed for 21 months . &quot;
a means to increase penis enlar@@ gers have been responsible .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 metres far from the world &apos;s fastest man .
&quot; Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ throw , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athletes have been recognized as many medals . &quot;
&quot; so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 to nine years later , after having found testosterone d@@ oping . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title in 2006 for testosterone abuse . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , during the 2008 Olympic Games , Bron@@ z@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ ille was given back to the CA@@ S International Sports court . &quot;
&quot; with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , he is ranked in two of the world ranking . &quot;
&quot; Liu Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world leader and gold favorite clubs has only been tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year old world champion , references to the in@@ banned dietary supplements were found , the lock of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA , and ran out on July 13 . &quot;
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian finds injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand arise with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ ag@@ early . &quot;
&quot; it had suffered from sec@@ ul@@ ously and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left it again . &quot;
she planned her return journey in early September .
&quot; the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Phu@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon also are also affected by Austrian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in terms of permanent contact with the local authorities , the Foreign Ministry arise . &quot;
&quot; in some 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok Hua H@@ in , there were two bombs explo@@ ded on Thursday evening on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai national police killed about 20 people , including the Austrian woman , three Germans , three Germans , three Itali@@ ans and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning once again two explo@@ sions were high , yet another human was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; also in Phu@@ ket , there was a bomb explosion in the morning . &quot;
the det@@ onation of the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong was injured in police by a taxi driver .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country then another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal worker . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities in a flower shop in front of the territory , the bomb was gone in front of the territory of the Coast . &quot;
eventually det@@ on@@ ations were demanded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
&quot; one went from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , called it . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; said army funeral Dan@@ ai , meth@@ av@@ ee fri@@ day before journalists . &quot;
we expect it to co @-@ ordin@@ ate a coordinated attack .
&quot; it was too early to express themselves to possible moti@@ ves , but probably in the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern in the attacks which is typical for the bombing of Muslim separat@@ ist separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; on the other hand , the Thai police declared that the attacks were not related to Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age , restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; said one speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , one assumes that the bombs from the ruling military jun@@ ta was placed . &quot;
the authorities have kept secret references to im@@ min@@ ent attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact date and places .
&quot; yet , be un@@ clear which group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police rejected their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings , as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment . &quot;
&quot; there are always smaller bomb attacks in Thailand , but they are mostly not against tourists . &quot;
Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Tha@@ il@@ ted King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; according to the reason of mind bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign recommends on his homepage , to make the instructions of Thai safety authorities as a result . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) landed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ham and its en@@ vir@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; after disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , there are not necessary trips in this provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) used for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday performed a few days after a disputed referendum on one of the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military a great influence over the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta @-@ boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs have been trying to sti@@ p@@ out chaos , while the country moving towards stability , improving the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had caught in force in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , keeps himself up to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting the handle for years in the utter@@ most south of the country of the milit@@ ants of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people were killed . &quot;
&quot; almost one year ago , in Bangkok , in Bangkok with a popular Hin@@ du @-@ shr@@ ine 20 people were killed , most of them were foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloody stop to the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is the Federal Office of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
&quot; after several national offices , the Con@@ vic@@ tor included the Group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; identity movement &apos; vulner@@ ability on taxation against the Freedom of democratic principles , &quot; &quot; Constitutional manager Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
so assur@@ ances of Islamic Faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we observe the movement now .
&quot; the &quot; identity movement &quot; is group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Multi@@ con@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of own identity by over@@ alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Constitutional prot@@ ector in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority worked closely with the country &apos;s decision . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to get their target audience , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Head . &quot;
&quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ le music . &quot;
the day Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ right Islam@@ ists .
this is not an advertis@@ ment for his own cause .
propaganda should appeal the people emotional .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible to a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; at last , there were reports of several states reports on &quot; &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D policies . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , I have no insights . &quot;
&quot; for the Constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant to a point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain people , the extrem@@ ist , changes its objective and is so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; therefore , whether such persons must have driven influence on the party . &quot;
this is not visible .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in rectangular alleged off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak in this context not ane@@ w terrorism . &quot;
but we &apos;ve found out over the past years that there can be err@@ atic structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Freit@@ aler group .
&quot; it may be certainly possible that further legitim@@ acy groups or small groups are planning to plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee sh@@ ei@@ ms or attacks from other right @-@ sex@@ ist moti@@ ves . &quot;
but one in German @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of sp@@ icious ror@@ ism is not recognis@@ able .
the previous groups were formed at regional level or in social networks .
&quot; at that time , Ma@@ isch was worried that many gri@@ ps of people went to the account of people that had not occurred before the scene in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ect in attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated crime fathers or followers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed off@@ ences that had nothing at a hat with the right @-@ right hand , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or the example of CDU , SPD or Left Party which , however , have been radic@@ alised by right extrem@@ ist mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is used for Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympics or world records domin@@ ate the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the aqu@@ atics center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slow that he was unable to see more in the TV pictures . &quot;
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; subsequently , Hab@@ its became a viral interest in social networks . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with@@ drew from 48 seconds behind a rec@@ eding and reserved the 59@@ th place of 59 starters . &quot;
&quot; however , it was rather his not just sporting figure that attracted the attention of international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian was awarded a special start of the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in different countries .
&quot; as most sport@@ s@@ men run in Eth@@ op@@ ies , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the great race .
&quot; quickly , the first nickname is the turn . &quot;
some media referred him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the whale . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; well @-@ being , &quot; the English tab@@ loid The Sun &quot; was fun with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; on him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he first played with a minute and almost five seconds over 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle , played there no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the course of Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i took attention to media attention . &quot;
&quot; the appearance of the sail@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in an advance over 100 metres of free style . &quot;
fr@@ en@@ etic was fired at that time Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old first performed eight months before the Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will continue to increase , if appropriate improvement for improvement . &quot;
&quot; after a trans@@ lu@@ ent calculation , the se@@ wer@@ age price in Az@@ endorf is at 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was found during the approval of the budget by the back@@ yard of Kul@@ mb@@ ach that covers these waste water covers . &quot;
&quot; due to justify foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is oblig@@ ated to operate the facilities . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from World Heritage , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg need to take deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the commission increases between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as managing director Herbert Schmidt showed the panel , a new cal@@ c@@ ulation of the fees for san@@ itation systems had been necessary . &quot;
&quot; during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , transfer and discoveries from the previous calendar period are to be extended . &quot;
&quot; with all three se@@ wage plants , Schmidt founded a relatively small se@@ wage plant in all three se@@ wage plants with a very small se@@ wage plant , which runs between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the small distribution principle , for example , expenses for necessary repairs to be gra@@ ved from several thousand euros . &quot;
se@@ wage water in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining .
&quot; furthermore , the rec@@ lining period in all three plants are not least estimated due to their age of restoration and repair expend@@ itu@@ res in a substantial scope . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for pupp@@ ets , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the az@@ endorf &apos;s se@@ wage plant , the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to failure . &quot;
&quot; in the pump pole , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old convey@@ ing equipment had to be over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed to over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed and in the pond water . after almost 20 years , the first sep@@ tic tank had to be avoided and an additional ventilation may be installed in order to keep the water legal specifications in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; contributing to these extraordinary expend@@ itu@@ res came to take into account the maintenance and maintenance costs which are considered to be considered in the new calculations period .
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs which , at the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 , is significantly below the current level . &quot;
stone houses made clear that in the low se@@ wage plant in the three plants can beat the expenses for operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Schmidt completed the market community of large maintenance costs in se@@ wage plants in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to be prec@@ ari@@ ed by stone houses in duration , especially since one could not extend the supply area of water @-@ purpose me@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al to extend these plants , because it is a deficit type . &quot;
Bulgaria falls for the first time in 8 months of inflation
&quot; according to national statistics , inflation in July 1 % was shown on a monthly basis . &quot;
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first above zero since October , when positive 0.2 % were recorded . &quot;
the annual average total of 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index of July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation was compared to July 2015 -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , compared to the pre @-@ month , the following groups of consumer goods observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1,7 % ) ; Transport and Culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 0.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell on clothing and shoes ( 2,2 % ) ; Mo@@ bi@@ liar , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as at the pre @-@ month at alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; effect as Asian caric@@ ature critic@@ ises
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter An@@ ime is inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel against races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to alter reality and to play with ident@@ ities in such a way that borders the Ab@@ sur@@ de . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a piece that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are irre@@ conc@@ el@@ ded , autonomous tools that produce more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ ections per day . &quot;
all patches with flaws arrive to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters are drawn in the past cr@@ iti@@ que in which they were accused of being acc@@ urs@@ ed with the App Black@@ face to prop@@ agate white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; as a week , some users struck a filter that gave them sl@@ ot@@ au@@ ge , false teeth and fal@@ se@@ ed che@@ eks , called it some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they asked if this repeated contro@@ versy sur@@ passed to a larger problem , that the company has di@@ lu@@ ct@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the messages and indig@@ nation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat that it would have disabled . &quot;
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as homage to anim@@ e characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders that have experienced rac@@ ism , the filter remin@@ ded the c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
other le@@ ased the An@@ ime comparison decided .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student , whose twe@@ aks were widespread over the photos that the filter &quot; infr@@ inging , and least was un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter@@ crossing of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and to argue the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ lowed @-@ faced , but that j@@ aun@@ dice has been taken into the ab@@ rupt extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural e@@ op@@ dra@@ fts .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in their hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are different from breed breed different than their older opponents - could be expected to expect sensitivity .
&quot; if one of snap@@ ch@@ ats produced a picture that is offensive for a user , &quot; so much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it was before the case , &quot; the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu said in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Z@@ hu decided to er@@ ase the Snap@@ chat account as a product manager and engineer for media , and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in a phone interview for media and in a phone interview , she said that it would seem to reflect a lack of diversity in adjust@@ ing practices in Snap@@ chat . &quot;
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the big part white , only male leadership and finished their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ mare Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either she has no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese I @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there but not in positions in which they are safe or feel comfortable to say . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that the Snap@@ chat left largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company has no deposit to diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
&quot; on Thursday , the Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company recently dis@@ closed a number of staff that focuses on sub@@ ordin@@ ated populations and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said that her Snap@@ chat account will be closed and added , &quot; I wonder whether they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military kidn@@ apping ISIS Secret service information , clari@@ fies Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation of the United States Central Command changed retro@@ spective information to draw a optimi@@ stic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it could have allowed the actual situation on site in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the dispute Committee , Intelligence Committee and Con@@ scription Committee , reported by a great dis@@ content under Central Command Intelligence analysts , who reported how Vor@@ bis has changed their ass@@ essments on the US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , in short , C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news service information , which were typically worn by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com professionals , regularly recorded a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism when it had allowed the actual conditions locally on site and had been consistently positive as analysis of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers are suffering when poor analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can Member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership errors in Cent@@ Com are sufficient to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed issues in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct hin@@ ts on it that government peaks below Obama supplies instructions , it shows how analysts get exposed to pressure from their preliminary laws , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments , and statements , before the Congress , were clearly positive as the facts &quot; presented &quot; the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , Cent@@ Com officials announced that a military back@@ drop of Mos@@ cons@@ ulate could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , second @-@ second city of Iraq , continues to remain under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republican Congress of Kansas , in a position . &quot;
&quot; from the mid @-@ year 2014 until the middle of 2015 , the Central Command has changed the post @-@ minist@@ erial reports to play the threat by ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force in the life after them , their concerns relating to the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the report published on Thursday , completed by more detailed insights , will be continued during the investigation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Inspec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Democratic members of the Intelligence Advisory Committee published their own findings with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force , with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com decided to create a consolidated trial for the creation of the pre @-@ minist@@ ering ass@@ essments of Isi@@ l and the Iraqi Security services , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , such as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of retro@@ spective reports , &quot; the mor@@ als under analysts and gave a little space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said no hin@@ ts to have found on an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts as a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the Congress of Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times of investig@@ ators reported by the General Inspec@@ tor of the Pentagon , following complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press conference of the Pentagon , announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not be reported to comment on the Congress while the investigations of the general inspection will still be underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; experts at times could certainly have benef@@ ited opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that news services and defence ministry is a controversial discussion of these important topics of the national defence . &quot;
the investigations have beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an claim that has meanwhile been made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year , however , questioned the question that President Obama may rely on Central Command for military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State recall the dis@@ agreements of more than ten years ago as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a font in Iraq only looked for a small occupation forces in Iraq and made little time to make up the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting about the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker posted a significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group that had no significant impact on the financial situation in the terrorist group , as these pro@@ vis@@ ory refin@@ eries were used to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this realization was not published , the Times stated in September . &quot;
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ der commander @-@ in @-@ chief of Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III was critic@@ ised by members of the legislative situation due to its excessive positive assessment of the military situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the USA win four @-@ fourth match in the field @-@ hockey women , a show@@ down with Britain before &quot;
&quot; one day after she had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victories over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember to have ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
&quot; however , it knows : the Americans are 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally defeated in their group with the British on the first place , which remains un@@ defeated by Japan after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will hit the first lap on Saturday in the last game .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two teams will finish in the first and second place within their group . &quot;
the first @-@ placed winner will take a little bit longer out of the road going into the other group .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ e through their success story , four years after she landed during the last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania and had the first time in her hands for three years ( her two older sisters played the sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National play@@ ful of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , since she could not qualify for the Ka@@ der . &quot;
&quot; then came the year 2012 , where she went wrong for her and her team . &quot;
&quot; following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to improve things for better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ horse in London that we have now .
we can completely tear off the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday night B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the near area .
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory at the tournament , but the team showed up surprisingly quickly and held the pitch of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game in her hands . &quot;
&quot; she finished a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left fl@@ ank , then moved to the middle and lu@@ pen@@ ed the ball in the gate to pro@@ claim the American women a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the neighborhood .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who always had to book a gate in any of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well the outcome of the next game will depend on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the Games of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ins &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , the Olympic Games are . &quot;
&quot; the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events will feel resistant and un@@ avo@@ id@@ able , a ro@@ aring relay between competition and stre@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which will protect from the wrist@@ s to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athlon . &quot;
&quot; you can not switch to the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the qu@@ eue at Coff@@ es@@ hop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there &apos;s Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is part of the Olympics for the first time and a cra@@ ck@@ ling of women with dimples , could definitely be able to be sent to Prime Time as it would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ ug@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold . &quot;
the Olympic flame is not lit for any event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade , there are sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol grip , ar@@ chery , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the chest and may reign over long .
&quot; but if I don &apos;t really want to make arguments for my particular favor@@ ites , then let me draw attention on the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ lets have already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it was in Sydney , it was really noticeable that many people had questioned that I had questioned , did not know that it is a Olympics . &quot;
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
&quot; even though the United States sent athletes to the competition , it has never gained a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and had a athl@@ ete until 2012 , who managed it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans to share the women .
Dong Dong in China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jump has a certain outdoor area , partly because it sounds for the un@@ defiled ear suitable for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as those sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a paid enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ary trem@@ bling of his never @-@ pointed out - but also the Gra@@ zie of gy@@ ms and diving , the two sports , which combines it essentially . &quot;
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline which means a lot like &quot; jumping board . &quot;
&quot; fir@@ ing winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , real and sal@@ tos ) before they finish at the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympic program , you will be rated according to execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two and thirty athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ ances must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and above , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes going and back , down and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also another polite target : in the world or the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; the goal is no@@ bel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but it is also what I myself in looking at these games as something ti@@ res@@ ome .
the trampoline offers an air break .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline jumping is up .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; it or she pr@@ all@@ les , seem@@ ingly heavy like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes upwards , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly upward . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course , not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wolves in the distance , just the dre@@ aming , elegant preparation of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition can only be in the Olympic Games .
&quot; the qualification and final dogs of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also about 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final times as part of a supplement block at both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; when the increase of consciousness is only achieved by att@@ ack@@ ers and objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes - like the male US Turner , according to the The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its kind of ri@@ pen@@ ing , new fans . &quot;
&quot; a generation protest@@ ers &quot; in Ethiopia , Long of the USA &quot;
violent protest in Ethiopia
&quot; demonstr@@ ators , the political changes in Ethiopia call for violent resistance to the government . &quot;
witnesses say that four protest@@ ers were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police in fire@@ work .
is Ethiopia just to break together ?
&quot; over the last ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid @-@ growing West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the past months , protests against the government sho@@ ok the country and expanding its regions . &quot;
last week thousands of people cli@@ cked on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the answer of the government was merciful . &quot;
witnesses said that polic@@ emen shot un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
&quot; in circulation , video about the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , are showing how security sle@@ eper young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;
the UN Authority for Human Rights now demands an incoming investigation .
&quot; it was still difficult to maintain this country and future will even become more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa , the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the West .
&quot; American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians together to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa when ever , get as much Western aid . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded in a considerable pace . &quot;
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new train in Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba &apos;s capital .
&quot; the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia was all other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations , constantly led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , dis@@ sidents were effectively taken into silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or into prison , or were killed in the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but this could change .
&quot; when you supp@@ ress People and have no other options to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ y@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
&quot; there are numerous complaints , which cover everything from land use up to worms in relation to power of the ruling coalition . &quot;
&quot; following a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the ten@@ sions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea , a battle for this fli@@ ck@@ ling , disputed line challenged in June hundreds of life . &quot;
&quot; analysts are afraid that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were forced more or less forced to attack the turbul@@ ences in recent years , and could be armed again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of pro@@ pon@@ ti@@ ation after years of tension explo@@ de under the surface now .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in the last years many Ethiop@@ ian were able to communicate with the social media , because cheap smartphones were increasingly becoming more common and the Internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government closed down access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially at protests , many people can still communicate via Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies to hide where they stop . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians said they were so at protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since Et@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , the predominantly Christian countries , are in politics and economy , while they exploited O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ lands . &quot;
but this also changes .
&quot; we are here to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , in the intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the disturb@@ ances is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; after his death in 2012 , Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leaders , was killed by the death of Ethiopia to his death in the year 2012 . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
&quot; analysts say that he was particularly active in it , to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special contractors to handle opponents and to make them un@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is missing on this legendary event , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di said , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ c@@ auti@@ ous reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the tig@@ ray region of the north of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he enjoys not trust the trust of the tig@@ ray controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands against elections prot@@ ested , which , according to the declar@@ ations of the government , was decis@@ iv@@ ely stolen by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following Raz@@ cia , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if there were less than in the past few months , and this time of un@@ rest was passed relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for its visionary infrastructure planning , as the new production train , as well as its measur@@ able adv@@ ances in poverty . &quot;
but apparently this did not prevent the intention of internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , protests in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ic city , served by Tig@@ ray , and the hatred toward the Tig@@ ray is always more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that protests like the United States and other Western allies are bringing in a unique position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though she recently decided that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; during the West , clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to ban his ally in an already vol@@ atile country . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di said , &quot; is a very thin free migration . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump tells his claim Obama was founded ISIS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy on Friday , showing his campaign that his multi @-@ repeated claim , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; founders &quot; of the Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
this clari@@ fication set new questions on communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans - whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ able to the American public .
&quot; it also brings together his fellow soldier , who stri@@ ve to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , in the curious position to explain any statement that he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the clari@@ fication at a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump made reference to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to signi@@ fy that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation perfectly seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative radio present@@ er Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to refuse the statement a little weaker , that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate wanted nothing to know about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism boun@@ cing on Mr. Tr@@ ump while he tried to draw the focus of his campaign due to falling circum@@ ference measures to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about economic situation in Michigan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ t &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes , and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m into his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he moved to himself when he said that the Russians should not fin@@ alize Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later , of course , I said &quot; Of course , &quot; I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows for Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the lingu@@ istic borders in politics and then return to rowing .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , as they arrive , and then &quot; clear &quot; according to how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication trainer , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also think he &apos;s smart enough to keep his testim@@ onies , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has received an estimate of its tone , since its circum@@ scri@@ ptions have gone back . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a big advantage in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally attemp@@ ting to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he is accused of understanding his critics or to understand his recommendation . &quot;
&quot; but while he is intensi@@ fied in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze launched his loyal co @-@ stre@@ iter into the un@@ comfortable situation , ir@@ respective of how prov@@ ok@@ ant may be his testimony . &quot;
&quot; Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps prominent princip@@ als , gave great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani so he asked about the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps of statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; in this sense , true that Obama had an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back @-@ bro@@ kers , completely false and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the mainstre@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , as Secretary of State , served ISIS to spread out ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and worshipped them , on each of his words , and to be vo@@ iced against him . &quot;
&quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , &quot; mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t . &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ ies about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Dis@@ counts as only evidence that he was un@@ suitable for the Presi@@ dential Office .
&quot; once pushed over the market , café in Green@@ point comes back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ u@@ red café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay bar , which was not a Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years of good coffee served . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was pushed . &quot;
&quot; the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , replaced the Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people were embar@@ ked on the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is changing , but I can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap store . &quot;
&quot; but when New York is change , it &apos;s also new recovery . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted Credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
coffee is still good as well .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old cafés , owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; as a customer offered a client , providing money for a new out@@ board , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches , bacon and cheese , and there are gar@@ ages such as cap@@ ers and auti@@ stic onions . &quot;
there is natur@@ ist bowls .
&quot; the café serves no beer , but there is fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he not@@ ices a st@@ alled power to the old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed together by Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently at one Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visits the ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; after being drawn to Green@@ point , she would take the way to himself . &quot;
&quot; after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the Kaffe@@ et@@ r@@ inken ab@@ gew@@ ays , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture in the Ver@@ b , which was right in me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered that day instead of their usual iced Coff@@ ea a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea Kett@@ le , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a loyal customer since the start of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered in@@ tox@@ ic@@ uous as the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket @-@ watch and they prepare my Everything @-@ ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and take new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual order , but sometimes it changes his whole thing with bacon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he has no gro@@ wl at the h@@ eg@@ te that the soap store has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold cup of coffee served as ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go down to her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points have also accepted the Café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer translated into the Polish , translated into Polish , and Rodri@@ guez said that he was going to announce it soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice not@@ ch wants to fill the cold in cold coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding into an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new publisher is enough to get their old favour@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; Joseph W@@ itt was the customer , and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café completed . &quot;
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said , Wh@@ ence the Lok@@ as and the Bu@@ yer felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after its ascent to the president , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a delic@@ acy , President Roosevelt had an Fai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen of Fifth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Jo@@ er@@ il@@ d@@ kr@@ k soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was quite modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée and as a dessert a p@@ ud@@ ding p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the suffering of people , &quot; Jane Z@@ iegel@@ sberg . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to Americans how to eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both the food histori@@ ans .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; was one of the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while bricks in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food @-@ perspective . &quot;
&quot; your latest collaboration , &quot; An existing meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when she met with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ itz@@ el snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in the business since its IP@@ crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ iegel@@ man , 54 , ordered a cream cheese with olive trees , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key pendant with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable . &quot;
&quot; as the reporter ordered min@@ ced , this was found the pair for a discussion on the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ sberg . &quot;
there was pean@@ ut bread with cheese and bean bread .
&quot; they were prepared from an ingredient and something very cheap , that stretches the ingredient . &quot;
imagine so many peanuts be eating that they serve as dinner .
CO@@ E sm@@ iled .
&quot; it must have placed in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression the table was in a American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women co@@ ves for male Fel@@ low and it was freshly baked , served on breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; there were the Americans who sent food to hunger in the first world war . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; records the ways , with which the country was around , not to be the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time in the food for Americans a central , under@@ min@@ ed theme , &quot; said goodbye , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget of bud@@ get@@ ing was the same : myst@@ ical food such as bre@@ ads and cold water were too stap@@ le food , the k@@ asser@@ ol@@ us as &quot; wonderful kind , essential facts &quot; , &quot; because ch@@ efs un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients were able to hide it under a cre@@ eping sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by low @-@ cost dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of the American kitchen for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; pec@@ uli@@ ar bl@@ ends were tried out , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nut@@ riti@@ ous satisfaction was given priority to taste or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , brick dish prepared a court from this ep@@ och , fried onions with pean@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular add on the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Z@@ iegel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real .
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions are not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping .
&quot; as never before or since then , bud@@ get@@ ary works - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country so strange . &quot;
&quot; having published recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to be &quot; house@@ keeping &quot; and the challenge to transform , such as creamy sp@@ aghetti with carrots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical da@@ in@@ ties .
&quot; in particular , reports on the answer of the government to the hungry citizens , as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Att@@ itude @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he enjoys the simple Iowa peas@@ ant kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke about the million multi @-@ million@@ th man of the world to whom he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gilded dining room and bore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderful real@@ ist@@ ical .
&quot; President Roosevelt had perhaps had the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or urged him to stat@@ u@@ ate an example with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the an@@ cho@@ ke of an elderly people with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms. Roosevelt said that the White House brought forth the boring food in Washington but also one of the most delicious food prepared . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food was rejected , as soon as the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; on our continued focus on calories and food , Z@@ iegel@@ sberg , as well as science is applied on food . &quot;
&quot; during the writing of the book , gave the eating habits of bricks to get better understood - for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the wast@@ age of food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; brick is reminiscent of : &quot; it really made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind of wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they pulled and co@@ e a dessert made them at home : the Pfl@@ au@@ m@@ end@@ ert , the president Roosevelt said to lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man and added that there was a common trick , nothing to miss a nice name . &quot;
&quot; there was no designed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone was able to di@@ ligence a spoon into the f@@ ences , brown lim@@ bs . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad . &quot;
CO@@ E took three times a sur@@ ge .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ dy , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed on bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he sat down his own life on the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar dedicated his life to man in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save her life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died at a Fass@@ bom@@ ber attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; White helmet , &quot; a civil protection group that previously delivered almost 60,000 people in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers set their own life on the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses , and to make the first aid in the war zone . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the Civil Guard that shows him for a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant from the ruins of a house passed around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians at the lumin@@ ous symbolic figure in the horror of war .
&quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , said lou@@ dly : &quot; for me , the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar himself fell victim to a victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
the helicop@@ ters have four façade bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district ; one was filled with chlor@@ gas .
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of Bom@@ b , lest any children play with it , &quot; quotes the image his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board of the S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a fine 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are only received with 150 years offspring .
&quot; the Green@@ land@@ hai Green@@ land@@ hai drives up at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he is just 1,@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
only when it depends on it acceler@@ ates the five meter long animal on a full 2.6 km / h - and it is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
&quot; this lifestyle characterised by lon@@ el@@ iness , but seems to be a bul@@ let for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen , University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported his colleagues in the professional journal &quot; Science &quot; in any of Greenland &apos;s 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ ran@@ lein of the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock , this lif@@ esp@@ an , which means a world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist presum@@ ed for a long time that Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie stone become old . &quot;
only the evidence were missing .
&quot; Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie are hard to observe , finally they live especially in the ice sea in front of the thin populated coast of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they appear usually only in the winter . &quot;
scientists know little about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie .
&quot; her time @-@ bends left them , as they hit six animals with a transmitter . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the shar@@ ks make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of a animal researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had swallowed up the or@@ b@@ ony of a young polar bears . &quot;
&quot; possibly , they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rou@@ ters at the bottom of the ice Sea and are looking for ca@@ da@@ ver , the upper water layers back down . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was only 81 centi@@ meters long , while the biggest 502 cm measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the lens in the hair with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this center of the eye lens arises before the birth of shar@@ ks , which contained proteins are not renewed later . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of Carbon @-@ 14 in the lens cle@@ us .
&quot; her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear arsen@@ al tests are trying to lock larger amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to 220 centi@@ meters in length , the lenti@@ cular core contained a low excess of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all larger Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie had a normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ quantities , which produces cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ Clock was seen for a 4@@ 93 @-@ centi@@ metre Greenland at the age of 335 or even 3@@ 92 years old while the record @-@ Ha@@ i should be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Grön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females become only offspring , if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
researchers now able to as@@ sign the researchers of the length .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters probably is on the threshold for sexually mature , and its age was 156 years old , Greenland &apos;s ha@@ ie with the prolifer@@ ation obviously can be seen at least one and a half century . &quot;
this should also be the world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ z@@ al@@ eme live especially in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland whale , stuck in the bacon on the neck of a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures often , the organism from the animals live on spar@@ kle . &quot;
so they mature later - and al@@ tern slower .
&quot; to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large . &quot;
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface due to the animal heat .
the loss of heat from one gram of mouse is much larger than 4 grams of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; thus , a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on it as many offspring as possible , &quot; explains the Evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist Sch@@ ran@@ lein as possible . &quot;
&quot; a very large animal , however , should invest his resources in a long life . &quot;
construction site in double pack
&quot; with topics about the building , the Municipal Council has been focused on the most recent session . &quot;
&quot; by relief , the panel provided by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally , the marketing of recently reported hab@@ itu@@ res may finally begin . &quot;
&quot; having clari@@ fied the plot of land , par@@ zel@@ li@@ zation and closing questions , the sale of land in the housing areas &quot; street paths &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( Area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Ex@@ cer@@ pt : 1 ) for those interested can do nothing more in the way . &quot;
&quot; the community is convinced that the banks in the rural , quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau young families and ru@@ sty seniors alike . &quot;
&quot; as it was called , construction consent can be addressed immediately in the City Hall , via the awar@@ ding of the plots is expected to be advised in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to provide further information about the res@@ ett@@ lement of other commercial establishments , associated with the creation of job creation , the Municipal Council decided to re@@ work in part in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; this way , in the area of under@@ mine , the industrial area has already been expanded by two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the city on the Main has therefore organized the competition with Paris , Dublin , and Luxembourg the best opportunities to move from London abandoned jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit most of the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ countries , head of the Compet@@ ence Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after a Bre@@ xit , it is uncertain whether money stores may continue to operate from London from financial transactions in the entire EU . &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport the approval in Britain is enough .
that is just great US banks .
&quot; several banks have already announced , jobs left . &quot;
the &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; lob@@ by@@ ists will be expecting 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) speaking responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as European insurance coverage , E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the organization for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) had its headquarters in Paris , but this is less important for the financial industry . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the emergency database is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ countries . &quot;
&quot; in Luxembourg , a large fund industry , however , cuts as much as Dublin at the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt would be much easier to achieve . &quot;
in addition the city with slightly available commercial real estate .
&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ countries . &quot;
&quot; at the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than in the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as fewer crimin@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the Corporate Consult@@ ancy Mer@@ cer stand the city on seventh place , Luxembourg at No. 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European domestic market , Frankfurt could put further banks and investors , as a result is the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , despite a Bre@@ xit vote . &quot;
&quot; the power relations : in London also accounted for about 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector at the end of 2015 , and in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 in the banking sector . &quot;
Gilead is awarded the ownership of the hepatitis C Patent and Mer@@ ck
&quot; a U.S. National Judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. has developed a refund of the cost of ownership , which are made from the he@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot;
&quot; in June Gilead there were a damages amounting to $ 200 million for the injury of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which remained in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster of the Sov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , after a US @-@ Richter produced a pattern of false behavior by Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other inhumane acts . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the law@@ suit filed on Thursday , U.S. official in Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to issu@@ ance of costs incur@@ red during the defense of the F@@ alles . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to move with Gilead to control the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck were accused of inter@@ def@@ endants and their property on laboratory work , which So@@ fos@@ bu@@ vi@@ r , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead . &quot;
&quot; from the USA , troops were saying that they rec@@ ap@@ tured a complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; by the USA , troops supported the whole control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters have left the city , a speaker of the group said on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the excerpt of the remaining group of fighters , have dig@@ ged within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they delivered over 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stage of fighters as host@@ ages , sharing Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish des with the D@@ KS operated Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Reuters . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are just running through &quot; , &quot; he told Reuters . &quot;
Clin@@ ies earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % of the Federal Government
&quot; on Friday , Hillary Clinton had published their tax statement for 2015 , this resulted in the Democrats in the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for charity , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Foreign Minister Bill Clinton achieved revenues of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster &apos;s book on their office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ton candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declar@@ ations for the last ten years with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to focus standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ ics Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ ear@@ i announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a sharp contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false declar@@ ations and retreat into his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot;
it is usually to publish their tax declar@@ ations for US presidential candidate although they are not oblig@@ ated by the law .
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a tax examination by tax authorities as a reason for his ref@@ us@@ al to ref@@ us@@ al . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ fer@@ in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the publication of the Presi@@ dential candidate in the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Co@@ hen , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Advisor , CNN said that he wouldn &apos;t allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax tests did not complete . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others also the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already abandoned that his ref@@ us@@ al questions arise in relation to assets , his donations for charity institutions , his business and various other connections . &quot;
Clinton had already over@@ thrown onto the subject and on Friday a video published on the Internet in which the rep@@ ublic@@ ans rep@@ ublic@@ ans Tr@@ ump will publish his tax statement .
&quot; on Thursday , she was talking about the topic during a speech on the Michigan . &quot;
he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; she said to the crowd .
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump paid no less taxes during the 1990s , and a journalist of the New York Times stated on Friday a number of account@@ ants and tax advis@@ ers that could be the case that still could be the case . &quot;
Federal Government has become a topic in the election campaign .
&quot; Clinton is supported by a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , who would make sure that people pay more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called the buff@@ ets called Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ con@@ glomer@@ ate with his seat to exchange their tax declar@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett stated that he has been under@@ gone a control examination by the IRS as well as Tr@@ ump , &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; before the elec@@ tors and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ ies campaign has released tax returns until 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ t , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , has an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % . &quot;
&quot; the approval of Clin@@ s from 2015 showed that this was only USD 100 of its income as a salary , unlike most of the Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment fund was a cost @-@ effective asset fund , from which the Clin@@ s divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9,000 . &quot;

Jewish director dismant@@ led Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; refres@@ h - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media charge after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli pre@@ fix as the Arab guests requested a staff member .
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ a , &quot; left his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by sending an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of the hotel .
&quot; however , the country was not listed in between countries that can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; what is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , it is possible that Israel eliminated or deleted ? &quot;
I wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to select Israel over an own call center . &quot;
&quot; after a declaration , the director turned to the hotel concept . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; shot him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
&quot; the reason that stood behind it , unle@@ ashed more anger in the director . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre@@ fix is deleted , the employee was quoted from Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big shame &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and cancelled by this event .
that is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has added to this hotel chain in Germany is even a greater shame .
no explanation is required .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; incident dissolved a rather large reson@@ ance on the Internet , where people called a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some under@@ took the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have been given to the alleged opinions of the Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; said it in another post , in which it was noted that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is located near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly rejected all the exc@@ uses and called the incident &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reported the mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct command to record Israel in the quick in@@ list , &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung on a speaker of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
added adds that the country code is now added .
police viol@@ ates Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against protest@@ ing Brazilian students
&quot; students beat together on Thursday in the Brazilian city Sao Paulo with the police , as they gathered to demonstrate for the reform of the government for public educational system . &quot;
the police sat down Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as a police officer tried to stop the students what led to the police , g@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals of the Federal State Court of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest@@ ers witnessed gra@@ ff@@ iti against the preliminary President Michel Tem@@ er &apos;s walls .
&quot; the recent protests occurred some days after demonstr@@ ators went into masses on the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ sive President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which was headed by a vote of the Senate on their con@@ vocation . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the increase of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade offset between Moscow and Teheran , grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian businesses grew strong in shops in the country , divided by the amb@@ ass@@ adors of Russian businesses . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies use existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , further trading is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
&quot; he realized that the trade agreement between Russia and Iran during the first five months of 2016 fell 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 , and was $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and tot@@ alled $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran increased 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade down@@ turn was reached by deliveries of machinery , motor vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign represent@@ ations of around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , affecting tourist numbers in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Irish tourists in Russia will be broken from the last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the amb@@ ass@@ adors hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the towns Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : Pil@@ gri@@ mage to the Pfor@@ te of Charity
the Minist@@ rants of the past@@ oral care unit Ey@@ es@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch at St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were handled . &quot;
&quot; in order to over@@ bridges the period till the next Rom@@ ri@@ cul@@ mination of all minist@@ rants in two years , the prime minister of St. Anna decided to prepare for the preparation and conduct of a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various Wall@@ papers aims to be checked and was finally decided for the Ep@@ is@@ o@@ fs@@ stadt Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , the Mer@@ cy of Charity , a special pilgrimage destination , was given to this year . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ aus arose on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , the priest sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and distributed the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; Hor@@ b from Hor@@ b was driven by train to Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ ai loved woman and so the pilgrimage was hit from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the single day tours have been surrounded by a short imp@@ etus with different prayers , songs and let@@ tering . &quot;
&quot; but even on the way , the Min@@ is made on field @-@ crossing , chap@@ els or churches , again , to sing together a song from a self @-@ assembled pilgrims song . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , the par@@ erg@@ es of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;
&quot; to the Et@@ app@@ enz@@ el , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller worked for a tasty as well as for dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day it went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to G@@ üt@@ enbach .
&quot; tags : the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting way , had to be climbed over 500 meters in the heat of heat , and then we had to recover . &quot;
the deser@@ ved reward was a common cri@@ ckets on the bath .
&quot; after the morning , in the fourth mushroom day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final fl@@ ap to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; deliberately facil@@ it@@ ates and happy , the Min@@ is met in the afternoon of Freiburg &apos;s Münster at the afternoon of Freiburg . &quot;

&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the vest@@ ry and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ metro@@ pole .
&quot; in the afternoon , there was by train back to Hor@@ b . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all participants agree that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong community experience were min@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; Scot@@ sman Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner takes home , as Br@@ ite gold clin@@ ches for cycling . &quot;
&quot; Scotland Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner ra@@ ste last night in the Men@@ od@@ rom in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame , when British team def@@ ending the title of London 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the An@@ chor@@ age , who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y to E@@ sch@@ y . the young and made the legend proud when he was stor@@ med to home a win by the favourite New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
&quot; once again , she repeated the trick in March at the course World Championships in London despite the back@@ drop Ho@@ ys , only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was Jamie Staff &apos;s replacement .
they did this in time as execution .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap to the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to conclude .
&quot; S@@ kin@@ ner was the man in whom they stayed , when they saw their potential in the vill@@ i , which has now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y winner - and S@@ kin@@ ner set out the qualification round at the qualification round , but in the stand@@ alone the New Ze@@ al@@ ander won the New Ze@@ al@@ ander in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; on the way back to his turn left , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and S@@ kin@@ ner held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy of strategy made a large part of the transformation , with the execution in a higher gear used to slow down and it is Kenn@@ y and especially S@@ kin@@ ner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert , and it fell to S@@ kin@@ ner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they rose to the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old S@@ kin@@ ner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison .
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we have positioned an Olympic champion in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just amazing .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 at the site Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des reported that he was deliberately pushed forward to the track by a weak start . &quot;
he moved this statement later and there was no objec@@ tion of English rival .
for such a victory there was no problem for this time .
Hin@@ der said : &quot; it feels with all the GB flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London .
we joined the team in the last three months .
&quot; with so many world titles , we got so bad that it was incredible again to win at the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a barrier in our progress in the last five months , we expect very successful five days at the Vel@@ o@@ drome . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is possible in the realm of possible that he repe@@ ats the victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who is exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently sacred date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the boxes of Ho@@ y is equal .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days . &quot;
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team @-@ event is always the best .
one can win it with his colleagues .
there feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; if he wins two other gold medals , he should be beaten to the Knight . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts of the day , but there were further good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
&quot; the world record , who won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the race , where Wig@@ gl@@ gins will focus on safety . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , he fought with admir@@ ers in front of the qualification , when officials called him to measure up his height . &quot;
&quot; in the appropriate female competition that will continue tomorrow and ended , av@@ anc@@ ated Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie at world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team is leaving its strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and catch a flock of medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary representation of the domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the Rio expectations have been shut down . &quot;
&quot; it played Dr@@ amas in the background , leaving the resignation of the technical key Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and mos@@ quit@@ ecture as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees itself the first evening of the competition at the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks like afterwards the legendary call GB@@ S , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment . &quot;
&quot; future of melting of Portland , based on lifting the energy contract &quot;
&quot; the future of aluminium mel@@ ts of Portland , Victoria , as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are waiting for the stake , since the plant operator will announce the supply contract and thus , as the supply of energy companies . &quot;
this step followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year no further subsidies to operate .
a sub@@ sid@@ y for 20 years is going out in November .
&quot; up to 2,000 jobs in the complex of Al@@ coa in Portland , Germany are at stake . &quot;
&quot; not less than 2000 work@@ places , direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it could be used to domin@@ ate domin@@ o@@ effects , since the melting of around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry melt , which led to an closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea force last year . &quot;
&quot; the melt of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked with closure . &quot;
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation over the future of the system , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price of the system . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which has supplied the large aluminum melting plant with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ vi@@ Valley , announced that three further owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is located in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , which is the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant is still operated in Portland , which means a further physical demand for stream through the melting &quot; , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L also said that the contracts &quot; &quot; securing businesses &quot; &quot; will be appearing in force in November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 month period , so they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from hence , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; said the electric supplier . &quot;
&quot; all potential impacts on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited to the forec@@ asting of strong sales markets for wholesale electricity prices . &quot;
AG@@ L divided that the value of contracts already wrote in its annual decline in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of an termination . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said , that the decision to make tre@@ aties to make the &quot; &quot; ability of liqu@@ or ... the melting &quot; &quot; or to ensure the power supply to the melting &quot; &quot; not neg@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that in 2010 it has completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which would have been into force from November this year , even if it is still a statement has been re@@ signed from the treaty . &quot;
&quot; analysts are war@@ n due to the bad economic conditions of the industry prior to the possible closure of Portland , Victoria and Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the analysis of the analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland is spending about 900 meg@@ awatts of electricity annually . &quot;
&quot; should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us that generator would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; the unveil@@ ing of his co@@ c@@ ars is expected so much , that in the last two years , pictures of the magazine still le@@ ak@@ ened before the official announcement . &quot;
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the fashion &quot; as &quot; models , the celebr@@ ities &quot; are on the cover . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , Oscar @-@ Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs. J@@ enner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; break@@ out model &quot; of their generation - under the former category falls , it is in good society . &quot;
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous people related to reality Stars or you@@ ths of today who know how to rotate a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if applicable to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who draw up in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success each .
&quot; with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was always a bit ten@@ se in the fashion world . &quot;
in June the first Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised them and called them &quot; Mist@@ akes of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings cook again high when the message came out with the release of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but on the Mis@@ sc@@ ut about the point seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ issue of the Vog@@ ue September issue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
she is running for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your under@@ coat by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you images of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells photos from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in their free time it is visible in reality TV . presumably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; centres of the municipal centres show a yearly of 160@@ ,000 people &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0.000 of the support of the country will be rejected by the municipal centres every year , while the industry is based on the effects of additional funding cuts already on over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ fair delay and legal services have been referred to for free legal advice and legal status . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the community , which are already out@@ dated , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; starting in June , next year , there will be a further 30 percent of their states will lose . &quot;
the director of the municipal office of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the community of municipal centres revealed that thousands of people have already dismissed each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without a lifting of the government &apos;s decision .
&quot; the Queens@@ bor@@ dering centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with ignor@@ ance and op@@ pres@@ sive debts , families who have been released by separ@@ ations , workers who have un@@ just@@ ly released - all these people have problems just@@ i@@ rous way , that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will be reduced by 30 percent in June 2017 , which means that thousands of assistance needs to be forced to Queensland with their legal problems without any assistance . &quot;
&quot; we call for the Federal Prosecutor and the Federal Ministry of Justice and the sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to promp@@ tly raising these middle cuts immediately , so people need help to obtain legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the regional government met its commitment to raise funds for legal action on the national average . &quot;
it is now at the time to view the needs of municipal centres and its clients as well as that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign , after personnel allegedly colon@@ ized gun &quot;
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign was indicted for alleged in@@ activity after being informed that their campaign leaders for North Carolina , in February , have been condemned to a staff while they were travelling on a Jeep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted on Wednesday at the District Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; in India , B@@ ordin@@ i had waited for months of waiting that the matter would be intern@@ ally regulated before he realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot;

Berlin / Schwerin : pol@@ l of European elections : SPD and CDU
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the gover@@ ning party SPD and CDU . &quot;
this was a representative p@@ olls of the opinion research institute in ins@@ a for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rain in the north , this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD over@@ threw the SPD from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent .
&quot; according to the survey , the party was only slightly before the CDU that could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is disputed among the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left side was 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the African D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country day . &quot;
&quot; despite a slight fall , the Gre@@ ens came back with 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) , once again in the heavy traffic day . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ PD would not be present with 3 percent each in the country day .
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ uties , the SPD &apos;s SPD election would only be 23 per cent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CDU remained only 18 percent to 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; following the Green Party ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , you are still thinking about the left hand at 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Represent@@ atives .
&quot; with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would oppos@@ e it in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Time series : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturers experienced a disaster .
the unit weighed nearly half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was pretty pal@@ pit@@ edly . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning of eight meg@@ abytes , which would be able to recover high resolution today . &quot;
a iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , fans can buy the devices on the internet , but they origin@@ ate from the st@@ one@@ age of the internet era . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had previously announced a few months earlier in the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; Office in the West @-@ Bo@@ er format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent for that time a lot : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax it was communic@@ ator to the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible by HTML @-@ Browser , if possible . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital add@@ ress@@ book and a electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be upgraded as a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro . &quot;
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros .
&quot; in August 1996 , no one could prove that communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era . &quot;
everything has since been different .
the smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the mobile pf@@ one of the Finn@@ s had an unprecedented disaster but was eventually sold to Microsoft .
&quot; today , the supplier domin@@ ate providers that came all much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; being online ever and everywhere , this is for many people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; some 1.4 billion devices sold were sold to Samsung and Apple alone , of which alone is 5@@ 55 million . &quot;
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
the well @-@ ongoing businesses of the countless app provider and the telecommunications company are coming .
&quot; in the meantime , around the smartphone developed a whole industry . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough for mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on Mac @-@ World &apos;s introduction to the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communications , all via touch @-@ screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the triumph@@ al march of Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market had seen that . &quot;
&quot; finally , they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
now the ages now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention .
&quot; currently , each German has been viewed 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all need to learn the smartphone even once again , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina sphere , in the Siemens management board for personnel . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must push the Olympic spirit and expand to Heath@@ row
&quot; Heath@@ row will not only be in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the largest attraction in London , just as we operate in London in 2012 , when we managed to make a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions are benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be again reaching by creating new possibilities for local and companies in the vicinity of Heath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities we are already able to create 10,000 new jobs , 40,000 new jobs and are preparing youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they predic@@ t us in London 2012 , there will be such thought that the challenge of the extension of the Heath@@ row is too large . &quot;
&quot; it was told me that England will never be ready for games , and that we will be bl@@ am@@ aged ourselves on the world stage . &quot;
the bi@@ fl@@ er had in@@ justice in 2012 and they will be wrong at Heath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to over@@ winds , but Heath@@ row answered every answer to him . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , Heath@@ row is for many and not a infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; enlargement is an option to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion an economic growth and a legacy of skills and employment in order to leave the airport as well as in all of the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in London Heath@@ row , which was a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure projects in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , which was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented cat@@ walk of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion at private investment . &quot;
London &apos;s London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heath@@ row will also be one .
&quot; it is time that we drive this Olympic spirit and wi@@ pe London and create our future trade , creating a legacy of skills and employment that may be proud of England . &quot;

Ad@@ block Plus on Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and mouse game &quot; on display block
&quot; according to one of the software producers , companies that earn an online production will earn attempts to deal with a &quot; cat@@ z@@ - and mouse game &quot; according to one of the software production manufacturers . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook , that it would block advertis@@ ements on his desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it could update its filter in the program to block again advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday Facebook with that his desktop @-@ page would change the coding on its advertis@@ ements , to identify the indication of that which is part of the page advertising is to be compl@@ ain . &quot;
but Ad@@ c announced that it has found a new way to handle the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ und @-@ Her battle between the appe@@ aling @-@ loose open source community and the conver@@ ters have already been underway in the invention of advertis@@ ers , and that Facebook is soon coming with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left social media in the struggle , is a powerful indicator that has become wor@@ r@@ ying sco@@ ot@@ ers for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study conducted by Pa@@ w@@ air and Adobe from last year , reports about 200 million people ad appe@@ aling ; nearly four times a lot of 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users , which access Facebook about their mobile devices , makes hand over 84 percent of the advertising revenue of fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has on display b@@ anners on desktop PCs next , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of income , so Facebook receives the investment of such step@@ ping as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook with that there would be &quot; &quot; ad Pre@@ ferences &quot; &quot; to have more control over them targeted advertis@@ ements on them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ r@@ ying new filters because they were also blocking the content on the side , which are no advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; he shared a letter of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; advertis@@ ers are a bl@@ unt , which is why we have concentrated on Develop@@ er tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences , to lay more control into the hands of the people instead . &quot;
MS un@@ mistak@@ able suicide on Swiss Highway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police calls for witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday , when committed suicide in several vehicles on a highway . &quot;
the incident happened at the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman placed in the Dark On@@ es &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , that of several vehicles , including a truck , was going to kill themselves . &quot;
she died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , the police said these as well as every Wit@@ nesses of the incident . &quot;
an investigation began in an investigation that a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation is divided by Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter against the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
&quot; however , it remains to wait if one of the driver is displayed . &quot;
was a battle avo@@ id@@ able ?
&quot; that is something that the Prosecutor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be considered responsibility .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person in the Dun@@ kl@@ en ran on the highway - was decided that drivers must not assume that pede@@ stri@@ ans had to run on the highway in the middle of the night , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year a polic@@ eman was acquitted of the murder , after she had killed a man and had killed one night on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has been un@@ conscious of the road . &quot;
&quot; the court noted that polic@@ eman had responded to a justified way -- a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
everyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges was to report at the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus had once resi@@ li@@ ent
&quot; according to the projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus based on tools and algorith@@ ms which res@@ emble climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have been referred to with her hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; scientists have previously mentioned that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , inv@@ entive @-@ like atmosphere , and still turned out slowly . &quot;
the model also lit the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably pointed out more dry areas as de Earth , but had once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accom@@ o@@ date life and shake vig@@ or@@ ously fast . &quot;
early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus exposed their daily side of the Sun almost two months , &quot; G@@ ISS Scienti@@ sts Anthony Del Gen@@ io stated in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which seems like an umbrella , to cover the surface of a large part of solar heat . &quot;
&quot; the result are average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than the Earth today . &quot;
&quot; the model brought a history of Venus , which resem@@ bles the evolution that was suspected of planet . &quot;
&quot; although it was supposedly hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years . &quot;
their oceans are dar@@ ken@@ ed and their water vap@@ or was burned down from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , only a fat atmosphere was left behind carbon dioxide to a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know it today . &quot;
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ells in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as a trainer and vice president of hockey operations at Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a minor involvement in the making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the last three years , I have acquired my duties as chief trainer and vice president of Hockey Operations , Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I thought a lot of thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , it needs and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
he must also have decisions on decisions which affect the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; today , Patrick has informed me about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , the winner of the Jack Adams Awards , as the winner of the league . &quot;
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and on top of the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado , in the first round of Pl@@ a@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota , he missed the season in each of the two last years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
&quot; as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy four Stanley C@@ ups won four Stanley C@@ ups - two pieces with Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ s@@ men take away talks and put on strike
&quot; the labour struggles concerning the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea oil workers are exposed , while all dispute parties are put on the table , said negoti@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adic@@ ally located on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; Wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and immort@@ als unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the process process of current str@@ ites , &quot; says in a common statement . &quot;
we will stop some full @-@ day sessions during the coming weeks to start the start next year to re @-@ start problems .
&quot; the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s rating is a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to companies have the required room to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has paid for his part by people and announced plans to re@@ plen@@ ish its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , because its operations are ration@@ alized as a result of its mega @-@ production operations with the BG Group &apos;s energy company . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are based on the lower crude oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that forced the British in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
the Scottish Parliament Council Dave Anderson met with workers leaders in early this week to discuss one of the largest labor force that took place in the North Sea .
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , and he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not just for few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in expenditure for new projects in the North Sea are expected to grow at an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Kepler measures rotary rate of stars in the star@@ ry of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
&quot; the latest mission with the Kepler Space teles@@ cope , astronom@@ ers tried to collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates under the stars of the star enh@@ ancing of the Ple@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; the new data will help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star@@ ry are rotating at different rates , as well as in which connection the rot@@ ational periods of the planet . &quot;
&quot; we hope to see through the compar@@ isons of our results with other star enh@@ ancements , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star@@ ry of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is about 4@@ 45 light years away from Earth .
&quot; many stars in this constellation , which originated some 125 million years ago , can now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; to top speed rates , these expe@@ ditions of stars encounter large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; because these winds are traveling through the stars of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; if a star is filtered , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each constellation by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a apparent star@@ ring -- as sun@@ spots -- recogni@@ zes .
&quot; the newest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more more massive stars are more slower than less massive stars . &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , and larger stars of slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes turn than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of Pl@@ ei@@ ades , we see that slow fans tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors will be to be very bright red , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star@@ ry of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmetic lab to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star resorts of Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot ahead of us what we would like to learn more , like how , when and Why stars their rotary rates slow down and so to speak their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues got in detail about their latest analysis of the conclusions of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;

&quot; Olympia , 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first d@@ oping cases &quot;
&quot; caught : for a positive D@@ op@@ ing@@ sample , weight @-@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski won &apos;t start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - Rio 2016 Olympic Games will be overs@@ ha@@ do@@ wed by the first official d@@ oping .
an intimate athl@@ ete had won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition , the first official d@@ oping slope became known for the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese activities of Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 meters steep@@ le ch@@ ase in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa from Bulgaria and Polish weight li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the anyway @-@ critical athle@@ tics cont@@ ests , these messages come to the accident . &quot;
&quot; on the last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven to be used as a m@@ asked means for d@@ oping substances . &quot;
the International Sport@@ court shof CA@@ S confirmed their exclusion on Friday afternoon in time of the Olympics .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final more than 100 m Butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds , she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part in the fo@@ oth@@ s over 50 m of free style . &quot;
Ch@@ en has applied for the opening of the B @-@ Trial ( IOC ) at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; the national Association assume the matter &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full co @-@ operation with examinations , &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua , from a message : &quot; we will be working with the International Sports court shof CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history is no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S responsible for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also at night of Rio , the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa during the night of Rio , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she was innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot; stated the female athl@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to take action to the banned substance EP@@ O by the banned substance . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa was suspended for provision@@ ally , according to B@@ NT should also have liked the B @-@ Trial . &quot;
Bulg@@ ari@@ ens Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow addressed immediately to criticism of the Ath@@ let@@ es .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not pull the right battles , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for example , about all weigh@@ t@@ li@@ fter from the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ing@@ ed nation could not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg was tested for three days earlier , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z tested positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both deny the in@@ gest@@ ion , both of them must not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is a further serious blow for the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association had the complete Russian team until an exception of systematic d@@ op@@ ings , which was signed in Kenya , also produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming sport , the former meetings in China had also triumph@@ ed between athletes and athletes . &quot;
this was the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt , purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the Podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle I want to pass over 200 m Fre@@ estyle I said , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Sun stood at the centre of a con@@ frontation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on . &quot;
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping che@@ aters , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Sun had been tested positive on the Stim@@ ul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ ac@@ din as a result of a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de be@@ ading h@@ ack@@ ers her rans@@ om
programm@@ ers of compres@@ sive malware - present security companies - and are successful thereby .
&quot; according to a recent survey of the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , based on 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surveyed companies surveyed have at least once , partly several times a victim of an attack with press@@ ors . &quot;
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies have already been the goal of a Ran@@ som@@ ware detection .
&quot; 40 percent of the victims paid by the perpet@@ rators requested by the perpet@@ rators , to be able to use the challenged systems and data again . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their finger@@ print software according to the observation of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attack the company network .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to differenti@@ ate rans@@ om are considerably higher than in private use . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a sc@@ ary rapid evolution of the pollut@@ ants , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of them were designed to give advertising to advertis@@ ements . &quot;
then the perpet@@ rators brought the perpet@@ rators software for itself .
&quot; only private users were the goal , but the change to company att@@ acking was quickly sc@@ ary in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; after a simple pattern , Ran@@ som@@ ware is working according to a simple pattern : once upon the computer of an op@@ ter , they are searching for irregular files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
afterwards the software covers the demands of the press@@ ors .
&quot; to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims must have money - mostly in the form of the cryp@@ to@@ ga bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where on private use the personal photo database is on the game , it is responsible for companies to sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage fails , if a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely break into business activity , where people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by loss of hospitals . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : pay not , you will only support the problem , &quot; &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of the companies pay , their data will be back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the perpet@@ rators , in view of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , researchers from F @-@ Secure have investigated the user surface and contact with the compres@@ sors and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; you explain to their victims , as they can pay per Bit@@ coin , direct support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for example files . &quot;
&quot; and will rep@@ aid individuals for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to pay partly hard to negoti@@ ate and pay five digits of sum to withdraw their data . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware detection , h@@ ack@@ ers become increasingly professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from the Antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; more likely , however , is that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programm@@ ers sell their damage software then in the form of a software building to the actual print .
&quot; the previous malware kits , including the malware , consulting and additional tools for a one @-@ time fixed price , were purchased between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in the scope of delivery , a custom@@ ization pool such as small configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the press@@ ors are looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
&quot; so one log@@ ging in one of the forums on the underground , buying the set of a criminal and t@@ asked another to install the software on possible many PCs . &quot;
payment is carried per in@@ fi@@ able calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then instructed sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that guarantee their data better .
&quot; over 50 per cent of the companies responsible for companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey , Ran@@ som@@ ware is able to withstand ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursu@@ ing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat for successful embar@@ rass@@ ing more , the perpet@@ rators instead of the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or quot@@ ations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thereby , the damage can be more than before , depending on the type of data . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators , too , could take entirely new objectives on the Internet of things to do . &quot;
&quot; at the h@@ acker conference , def@@ con demonstr@@ ating the safety researcher , as they could obtain a thermo@@ stat on the Internet connected to their control . &quot;
in the middle of winter the free folding of a der@@ art blocked heating so much sacrifice is quite a rans@@ om .
&quot; if the perpet@@ rators then switch to a factory in the future instead of the heating in the future , ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in the Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use .
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the vers@@ atility of a min@@ iv@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds quite re@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform , as the new jazz has been designed in everyday life as extremely flexible . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m hei@@ gh@@ ted HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in F@@ ond , there is no space . &quot;
&quot; the interior materials of the interior are well processed and very comfortable , only the cockpit @-@ top is falling there . &quot;
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V storage space .
&quot; it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l for high @-@ resolution and 10@@ 26 l with fitted back @-@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less mag@@ ically , as it sounds : the seat of the rear bench can be folded as kin@@ da chairs and provide storage space that is high from the ground up to the ceiling of 1.@@ 24 m . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
&quot; the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V , thanks to the torque value of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas . &quot;
&quot; however , he should set up his work somewhat qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily usage of 4.7 l / 100 km is very pleasing .
there is still another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot;
the steering is likely to be more direct .
the equipment is not desired in the top @-@ tested top model &quot; Executive &quot; .
the City @-@ emergency braking system ( works up to speed 32 ) belongs to the coll@@ ision warning system and the track support system .
&quot; the coll@@ ision warning sometimes irrit@@ ated , because he scored many obstacles in the leaderboard as &quot; her@@ ited objects . &quot; &quot;
the Fern@@ lighting assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed control acts on the traffic sign recognition and dro@@ s@@ sel@@ t in demand the speed .
&quot; the full connectivity is but only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and more . &quot;
&quot; two US@@ B@@ - and a HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest , and are therefore something aw@@ k@@ ward . &quot;
the roughly 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped Top @-@ dies@@ els are in order .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much , will receive the petrol from 20000 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
engines comply with Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday @-@ day car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : down@@ fall on passenger bridge
a airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; a liability may only be conc@@ ei@@ vable only with dangers which are typical for aviation , argu@@ ed the Upper Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken off with the fall of a knee .
&quot; however , the accident could happen everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damages for man .
case of disease : when pays of the promot@@ er
&quot; after their trip , you only get money back when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ ful in the hotel . &quot;
but that is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
&quot; in the case , a family was severely affected by the second day of their Turkish descent to diar@@ rhoea and vomiting . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease brought out the holi@@ day@@ makers on a defective lock that allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family was the view that the journey was lacking - and lam@@ ented against the promot@@ er .
&quot; before the court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
the collapse in fact was defective .
but the organizers finally knew just before the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out until then that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he didn &apos;t hurt his information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since in the samples of water no imp@@ ur@@ ities were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly through cont@@ ag@@ ion among themselves - belong to the general risk of life .
&quot; of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were ill . &quot;
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people had worried about other attacks . &quot;
the state must state and react to terror at the same time .
&quot; certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ r@@ ator with hatred and split . &quot;
we will not indul@@ ge the terrorists .
&quot; if off@@ ender would have to leave the country faster , but the security and force of the population for the refugee policy has to be left . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to implement the proposals by the German Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced a further person@@ ell rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ digit magn@@ itude of several years . &quot; &quot;
symptoms of sympath@@ ies must be re@@ plen@@ ished under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the weapons right will be form@@ ulated that especially the purchase of weapons in the internet is worth . &quot;
the last lot discussed per@@ sever@@ ance for physicians to keep words in accordance with de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions , as the threat of citizens could be dimin@@ ished , he said with a view on mental ab@@ normal@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; in order to oppos@@ e a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social care for necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be prepared better to deal with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
&quot; for the prosecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contributes to how to raise security further . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior spoke clearly against action against action .
&quot; this was a ear @-@ whi@@ p for the CDU / CS@@ U CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère was rejected by the union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of double nationality .
a general prohibition of bol@@ stering bu@@ oy@@ ancy for un@@ constitutional problem@@ atic .
&quot; one cannot offer anything , which is re@@ jects , and I rest the carrying out of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
they could speak about rules on road traffic or for witnesses .
&quot; green boss Simone Peter designed the minister , he wants to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror effort and ability to sim@@ ulate action . &quot;
&quot; left party leader Bernd Rie@@ x@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; a fleet of Pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ ter of the residence bring people no more security in this country . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
it looked regularly on the h@@ aul@@ ting road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal de@@ fle@@ ction should be extended .
&quot; this is a good news for all the passengers , who walk in the traffic on the surrounding street every evening in st@@ au , when they drive over the highway &apos; Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; road transport vehicles extends on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) between the Hammer Road and the exit Wes@@ eler street , the right @-@ de@@ fle@@ ction lane by 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then sign directly from the Hammer Road right .
&quot; the major advantage : the traffic spl@@ its early as well , whereby the total number of exp@@ ires will be improved on the exp@@ elled section of the state road 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea , with the extended exit , had the CDU faction in the District of Münster @-@ West . &quot;
the road @-@ lane on the Zu@@ br@@ inger plays the car drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days the return head goes up until the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ op road and sometimes even beyond .
&quot; for this reason , the N@@ adel@@ hr is located on B 51 shortly before the departure of Wes@@ eler street . &quot;
from here the traffic is only fl@@ ashed across the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be returned to a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations revealed that the bridge has no longer the necessary load capacity to absorb the heavy traffic .
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck , which will be constant in the linked con@@ gest@@ ion , the state company cannot say . &quot;
&quot; but with years to calculate : because the bridge has an official remaining time , up to the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for extending the legal de@@ fle@@ ction , the state operations are deliberately looking for the transport period in the school holidays because with disabilities . &quot;
the traffic will be tra@@ ced on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
inter@@ cultural tour : cultural Activities for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre play &quot; The un@@ seen house . &quot;
the association Nim@@ a &apos;s and the Young Theater are planning a music project now .
&quot; Nim@@ a &apos;s association enables young people to visit refugee and refugee camps , cultural institutions in Münster , Germany . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited an idea of winning piece &quot; The Un@@ seen House &quot; of the Young Theater , Münster , Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural voyage &quot; &quot; between eleven and 15 years , the inter@@ cultural voyage took over 19 students between eleven and 15 years . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with mig@@ rant and refugee grounds , the opportunity to attend schools with welcome groups , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most of the young@@ sters of class were between September 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and donated little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic pictures and video animations , it would have been possible to follow the fact that the press release of the Young The@@ aters was Münster . &quot;
&quot; Nim@@ a &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from the language of Language , and the young theatre will work together during the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; between October and December , juven@@ iles with and without fluor@@ ine and mig@@ rant back@@ grounds between 14 and 20 years will receive the opportunity to get professional , professional dance courses in the fields of singing , dance , play and music . &quot;
special offers for children and families in the theatre play and the@@ atri@@ cal language centres are planned .
the &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; project goes on .
&quot; given the rise of Asc@@ ended refugee , the association expects to participate with many classes that participate in . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope on weather repair
&quot; the weather has made the shooting stars in the Sou@@ thwest of Germany in the south @-@ west of Germany , on Friday a tri@@ ke by the bill - but there is still hope . &quot;
&quot; the night was not suitable for clouds and rain to watch the spectac@@ le spectac@@ le , the chairman of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stars is Per@@ sians , who , with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour , are among the fastest star shooting stars . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which is in the north east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , you are wander@@ ing around in the evening , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning there is no longer thinking about sleep . &quot;
that &apos;s all other than relaxing .
&quot; after all , one has such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep sleeping disorders and over ten percent , their sleep frequently are frequent or permanent than not relaxing . &quot;
how are sleeping problems or sleeping disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are many different causes of causes , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the German Society of Sle@@ epers and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; as you understand land@@ sc@@ ly , but it &apos;s not an input and sleep disorder . &quot;
&quot; many people feel straight through to sleep uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wagner &apos;s ne@@ eding , member of the German House@@ hold association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; beyond this , organic , psychological or behavi@@ oral factors are able to stick out medications but also medicines . &quot;
not rare is the sleep disorder expression of another disease .
&quot; very early wake is especially for depression frequently , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot;
&quot; and it may be , that various factors can thank each other . &quot;
&quot; for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , wo@@ ken up all two to three hours , and starts to p@@ onder@@ ing over everyday problems and worry , we@@ ars a example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should you sleep with sleep problems ?
&quot; who does not sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights per week , should go to the doctor , says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment can look quite differently : it is cast down , tired , in@@ sufficient , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood changes or physical problems such as stomach or heada@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; to relie@@ ve the sleep disorder , it is important to find their causes . &quot;
&quot; as a treatment options , there are behavi@@ oral changes , cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy or other medicines - classic sleeping chains only in exceptional case and no more than two weeks - in@@ quire . &quot;
&quot; sleeping alco@@ hol@@ s in Germany hardly , he emphas@@ izes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ bers , head of the inter@@ disciplinary sleep medical centre of the Char@@ ité University of Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , at sleeping difficulties , one should first apply to the doctor , says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot;
research can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause .
who was to sleep in sleep laboratory and what is going on ?
&quot; in the sleep laboratory medicine , medicine for example in snor@@ ing with breathing difficulties , in illness of disease @-@ fatigue , at bed@@ time or if you do not find the cause of a passage of sleep , explains Fi@@ res . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; please do not only make a nap , &quot; says Fi@@ res . &quot;
&quot; after the wi@@ pes , one goes to the bed in its normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to electro@@ des at the body you can carry a nose g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ el@@ ight on the finger . &quot;
a camera on the ceiling is also drawn up on the ceiling .
how can those affected problems get in the handle ?
&quot; there are quite many positions , where one can apply for better sleep . &quot;
&quot; We@@ e@@ ß is based on : regular sleep and standing time , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep to sleep , do not watch TV to sleep , and don &apos;t watch TV at the clock - then you start to calculate immediately , and that is quite and certainly not favor@@ ably . &quot;

&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a Dsch@@ ung@@ el@@ kö@@ nig 150.000 € , no one should know about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night on Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the support system in the swimming sport is bad , the d@@ oping control is very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we can not compete with countries that can work very much and do not work exactly at d@@ oping , or even run it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that here the controls are to be set , &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported for nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is how you should keep it with countries .

airport : gang of baggage duc@@ ts arrested
professional th@@ ie@@ ves at the airport Düsseldorf
&quot; on Thursday , the Düsseldorf police managed to capture the capture of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several types of pocket and baggage steels as a gang .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civil servants involved in the area of the airport Düsseldorf , a gang that had known the polic@@ emen from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ik@@ es since mid @-@ July , and were largely professionally developed and very professional . &quot;
the specialists of crimin@@ als Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 may prove the Thi@@ ben to have entered into Germany for the disp@@ utes of crimes committed to Germany .
&quot; in doing so , they caught a total of over 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old Towers , a couple of lin@@ ers , in between still a remainder of the cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in works on the first glance , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walk along the road from east to west , one comes to play@@ grounds , a fres@@ her nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
to the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
&quot; in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which should also be demolished soon , will be built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments . &quot;
&quot; articles about this &quot; trendy city &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate firm Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , will be preferred by burning cars in the last few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the residents of the rental contracts , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year several times , the Berlin internal en@@ ig@@ ator Henkel had been a tough approach to support the project , the area referred to as &quot; No @-@ Go Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers , pat@@ rou@@ ded the police three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three club cars on site , locked parts of the street and held visitors from leaving the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the newly renovated building worker commissioned the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court decided that the evacu@@ ation was illegal , and a day later , police and workers moved under the ju@@ wels of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
on this summer afternoon the road seems peace@@ fully : parents walk with children walking and people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun and others talk to pre@@ m late .
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the hood , there are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; left force is not the main concern of many people : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who stands here three children , mainly from the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the skin projects , they share the concern against increasing mit@@ es and vent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z who wanted to rep@@ ay the left polic@@ y@@ protection from v@@ andal@@ ating left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , the Berlin Internal Market and the police have up their neighbours , evi@@ d@@ ently not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working district , which today also fell in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied by the former German Democratic Republic , including nearly the entire Main Street , which were close to the Rig@@ s . &quot;
&quot; while the main@@ boards had been cleared in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly becoming the mag@@ nets for tourists and voting liner from all over the world : with them , the natives of GDR times and former home network have become their max@@ im . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the case , which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ s are attacked as symbols for this development : they are recogni@@ zing them on the designed slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were thrown into rings .
no other road was mentioned in this year together with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous force . &quot;
&quot; a reason for this , that not all neighbours may have a problem , could be that they are not affected by crime : crimes such as body injury , statistics used almost exclusively against police officers . &quot;
&quot; the most important part of the criminal off@@ ences make material damage , which is rather the new built and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house next 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , cannot be speech of un@@ certainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is appe@@ ased : people in the 94 are their neighbours , that they have not been determined . &quot;
even the famous burning cars also give it straight to the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
&quot; for those who studied architect , her road is no criminal spot , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , live together on the road and get more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is stuck in the Rig@@ a@@ er street - and stayed .
&quot; therefore , it was so important that the residents of the residents get back their streets : from the police , politics and the media that suddenly stressed the interpretation of the district in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of inhabitants as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by pressing ton@@ less re@@ constructions in former builders , who are pushing the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; finally , these are con@@ domin@@ iums that are not interesting for many - here are rather people who are not so good , &quot; says she . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction , I can absolutely not gu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do , if any one has never heard ? &quot;
&quot; on all sides of fru@@ stration , there is also among the police and the residents . &quot;
K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for conc@@ essions that had little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who draws , should be aware of this - just like someone who is moving into a pub district where you can compl@@ ain about noise . &quot;
&quot; all people only with first names have therefore been asked to be called , not named with their real name . &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organis@@ er .
&quot; in addition , she is a social worker . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Refu@@ gee Agency for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugees , administration , authorities and anyone else can be involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteer is more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ mel@@ au that has a problem . &quot;
so some - less mo@@ cked as much rather to the multitude of wish areas were targeted - meant as the administration wanted to write the site .
&quot; searched for an administrative body with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an ei@@ vable wool mil@@ king . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes . &quot;
&quot; especially to organization , work with people on site and behind the scenes , as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been in part for six weeks .
it has a 50 percent spot on three years .
&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ en- and full members are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon new container are available in the Was@@ enstraße
&quot; it has been a severe problem , for some time , to find apartments for the connection of the border , which have been recognized . &quot;
&quot; for the connection , the municipalities are responsible . &quot;
you must under@@ take the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
&quot; the costs for the construction , rent , or renov@@ ations of these accommodations , must carry up the Commun@@ es itself . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the coun@@ cill@@ or on local community and job center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lord wants to offer its apartment . &quot;
the search has been designed for some time than very difficult .
&quot; de facto , the administration has no private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it has not been working on private apartments , as Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , generally speaking flats must be er@@ tified , as it is so nice . &quot;
so soon new container are set up in the Was@@ enstraße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , are Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed lead , practice sessions , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants are to be arranged or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house master , do @-@ profit work - and motivated and very tidy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
it hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive impact .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
&quot; activity , however , does not mean work . &quot;
&quot; the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a conc@@ ei@@ ving feeling .
&quot; so there are offers like sports , contacts with loc@@ als and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and honorary posts .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are allowed in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you have to explain the refugees that it takes and they can cover the time sensible , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who eventually develop the feeling , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be un@@ profitable , who will never integrate himself . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there is also no problem , &quot; says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer may always be motiv@@ ating others too . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : did the two have been afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small municipality like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer clearly says clearly , &quot; what man@@ cher na@@ i@@ v may call . &quot; but if you could not exclu@@ de any residual risk and does not want to exclu@@ de it . &quot;
&quot; sensiti@@ vely , the hel@@ pers are already sensitive . &quot;
these incid@@ ents are also the topic of the refugees .
they would have been afraid that the attacks bring them completely in ob@@ itu@@ ary .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so major and honorary posts have to hold out in the region and in the region .
they always have in the background that soon a new push of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
this question is clear to answer the politics .
actually it is un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we would like to go , &quot; &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , this would relax its location . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher has already been fully utilized to integrate the previous people sensible .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; however , when people are in need , they have to help them , both women are united . &quot;
the political world situation is so complicated there is no easy answers .
chim@@ ney : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicopter looking
the police helicopter flew around one hour for an hour - successfully un@@ successful .
two unknown males are violent on Friday morning vs. 8.@@ 50 am violent to an apartment in a multi @-@ family home in the Lin@@ den@@ weg path .
the inhabitants surprised the two and struck the un@@ hol@@ den in the run .
&quot; the two men were approximately 1,@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters tall , probably m@@ asked , carried both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black ho@@ o@@ ded pow@@ ders . &quot;
they fled towards downtown .
&quot; the police force several stri@@ kers , as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the flag@@ ging went out without success .
&quot; perhaps the unknown fell in fact , close to the apartment or in their escape . &quot;
