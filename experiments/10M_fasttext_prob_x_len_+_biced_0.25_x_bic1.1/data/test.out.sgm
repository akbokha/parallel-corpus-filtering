<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps Economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">"investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP, both Clinton and Trump wants to stop."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the two US presidential elections, however, are unaffected by the tax and energy policy, as well as in a basic demand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton lies a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">"of course, on the role of the state."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Trump wants to keep the doubt little in doubt, and warns that the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as a result, Clinton wants to authorize and regulate the economy and regulate the economy."</seg>
<seg id="8">"by contrast, it would be quite different, reverse Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will return Regulations massively, and it becomes powerful tax rate with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in contrast, Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to open, he has prepared the disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the wealthy would therefore be increased."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in which they must be invested, Trump and Clinton are almost worrable."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State-owned investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are rejected by the state-critical tea party of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"on Trump, there may be partisan discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">Clearer are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations, and to drive the coal transport in the USA."</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas, to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"by contrast, Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies with its investment program and demands:" a country will create clean energy, and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be there."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the tranacia trade agreements, they want to sign both."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them want to isolate international trade but just use American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">It should then be paid better than Clinton demands.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hungry.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 USD per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage must be up, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months should probably be likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on one hand side is Trump, who wants to boost the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"its critics meet him, so that the budget deficit would have only bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants to demand for the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence is one of women, who flee alone, almost daily for everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen four women sit on four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby that is not a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks looking forward to the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother starts up on the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they notice that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the Executive Director of Condrobs, a carrier for social aid in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are winged.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentralized accommodations for women-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs created the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 females and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no - not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated: every woman who arrives here, made experiences with sexual violence on their flight," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted because of them torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as the hope of hope."</seg>
<seg id="24">"for women, other reasons for the escape:" many steal away secretly, because they do not see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland they have gained experience with sexual violence, forced, honorary morden, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This continues her.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run this continues.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, they call for a bottle of water a sexual action, no rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women alone are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe this, once they wandered in Germany, irre, tells us."</seg>
<seg id="31">"even here, single women in refugees would often be regarded as minderers and worst if used."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to the fact that about 90 per cent of women, who live in the Munich office in the Munich, estimates them."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntarily developed."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the life, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"they often don't need to worry about, it only need more accommodation for them, called Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">Bavaria is the seven District governments in charge of refugees in charge of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to the question, whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their condition, some answers with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there are not something in accomodations of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Schwaben alone, women are not stocked separately alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press-presidents of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, lower and medium-franken areas there are in some areas dedicated floors or their own houses for single-standing women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodation only for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the Committee "Rights of the Women and Gender Equality" committee in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a trial which has been published for the Committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are separated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy or men are lacking, men and women can be accommodated, it can come to - ongoing violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"especially the shower room should be separately accessible, and can be easily accessible for women, in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this protection of protection, you can read the congestion that there is at the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since she has been talking about, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Affairs"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and proclaim an official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin wants to receive his Turkish counterplayer in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I can't resist the impression that Ankara most wants them."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the pallet, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smiles worked narrored, and it hardly felt warmth, even for its restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day the newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved so much better than never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">"for me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable kitchen revealed that Russia's state of state had not forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of crisis was the first thing he mentioned in its introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border by Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was wasted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divided Putin and accused Ankara to fall in the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Verger was even bigger since it was committed by a supposed boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding rebuilding will be difficult if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media carried out a sharp, restricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"once, the Turks seemed to blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the accusations from senior officials, that Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trading in territories of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the accusation that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a way of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of an armistice is clear at hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is first and foremost all friends who can get after he was enthroned with a coup d'etat that he failed last month during a failed coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular, the ban of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, itineraries and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-seasonal onslaught in the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week forecast the state television cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish farm imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" tourists long, tomatoes are long here. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is raging to the West as its reaction to which tried power to be weak in a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the continued grouting via the EU accession negotiations and Putin will come out to reduce the cooling benefits from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, Russian state of state won a bonus for that he requested a coup support for the elected state organs."</seg>
<seg id="40">"for Moscow, this is well-noted for Moscow, that even a profound fear of regimen has changed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glorious palace of the sea has enabled Russia and Turkey, an analyst once described me as an analyst," Alliance of external sideways ": two countries that violate themselves from the west and are treated badly."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, between the two still big differences exist."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the largest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently announced the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support mutual sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after almost three hours, the President had also said to the press conference, they did not even strive the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey mied it on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found on Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, as NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian fight jet - it is certainly better to talk to the two state of state at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="8">"born in 1972 in the capital city, Tallinn, he made his conclusion at the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo's Embassy in Tokyo."</seg>

<seg id="12">"Putin announced the Russian TV station on Friday, that IVANOV therefore asked to leave his position and recommended Vaino as his successor."</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has taken mysteriously in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey IVANOV was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin's engagements as he works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>

<seg id="21">But the official claim - a man who once received as a potential president who would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin that are cited on the website of the Kremlin, IVANOV" "It's true that I asked you in a conversation with me this very complicated post - you could almost say - Dewerly post four years long."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turned out, I have been chairman of the Russian President's Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former member of the state Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Chancellor's Federal Chancellery (FSB), who was appointed KGB, was appointed IVANOV as his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"as Putin came to power he called IVANOV as one of five people, whom he trusted in most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was believed that IVANOV could become President of Russia, as a third term in Putin was violated against the Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken from another, near allies Putins, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>

<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the closure of the lock between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a finicky activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"all in all, almost 79% of all bricks at their place and the last section of Decks get a concrete pit for the deck, which means the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Greens mean: investors are expected to be much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 inexpensive apartments in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes the next call for "action-concept".</seg>
<seg id="5">Yet argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">The first line is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Christoph Frmann, SPD faction leader, said:" we are willing to build us with the Greens, "who wants to build a municipal surfaces in the future, must point 20 percent of all the apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the favourable apartments can also arise in stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the large party in the town hall was, like the Bratmann:" how are you going to build up to private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent to such areas, but as possible as 20 per cent of the apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing program, which will cost millions, will need to be paid for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, the Bratmann:" there are currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors a few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Left is still responsible for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of his, like the Bratmann, bathe in the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the concept of action is implemented, which will provide additional tasks in the building management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will receive the specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">"yet the program is not fully integrated: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should already be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do you compare the loss of further 1,300 inexpensive apartments, whose advancement will run out in the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, the policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the town's ongoing ties."</seg>
<seg id="24">"furthermore, it would have to be thought that apartments are back in the price connection again."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the West town.</seg>
<seg id="26">One blow can solve this problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the West town there will be at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be able to get into the price connection for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this is the owner who does not represent construction companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing has been drastically increased in the western city, one gets away from the goal of so-called mixing."</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of social guards in just a few districts is not to give it any more.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the Greens thus reckon, that there will be movement in discussion."</seg>
<seg id="33">"leader Holger Herlitschke writes," "for a broad majority, the CDU with the boat must be."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller covered his immune system and Würodeflex in a serious test - by refusing some of the most dirty and unarrests places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scrapped his course on a euro cord, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a washing knob of a train toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before removing any object, he used a luminometer to show and show us what he will let."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but this experiment, which was made under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results in daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, the washing knocking of a train toilet which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in one kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright with doctors and medical professionals conducted over the promotion of Darmbal bacteria as well as its own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left behind him that he had rejected, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of his intestines by travelling around the world, specifically as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">Public funds to train stations until washing up rinsets of toilets. the task assigned his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"in film he told:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and slaughtering. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the movie, he was definitely justified."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused to be a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its proofs showed a Luminometer count of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in comparison, the Luminometer count is less than 60 washed hands."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse, after their Luminometer count was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">He says in the film he says: "this comes the worst thing I smoked in a toilet.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will feel nothing here as it is inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company will equip Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer the consumers really something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watching and at the same time explained the advantages of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We were crazy flying colors that ended that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in health health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment that is associated with intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the director of the film, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him, like the ekeldest Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there was things easier where it was easier to bring Ian to live them, and others, with which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we have recorded some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio conducted by 2015, 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria were associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they have at least occasionally products that contain mitigorously bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="10">But as interior minister it was located on results and on a "recoverable consensus" within the Coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">De Maizière brought a little time according to the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before completing his conclusions for the safety of the republic.</seg>

<seg id="25">"and with some points - at the imbalance of thought, for example - the question arises: what does it actually mean to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">"but it can't be put in speech, that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people were worried about security for the high number of refugees."</seg>

<seg id="3">"before you come to the commentary parts, in order to skip him under the pseudonym non-aging, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the redevelopment of records of records are not on a boom in millennials that want to welcome the realities of physical objects, but due to mid-life-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"those who recently bought a plate recently, are in the age between 45 and 54."</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most probable Käuge group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobbyists - it has an emotional meaning: older plate drivers keep their feelings rather to spend (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on television, I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy road in Soho run, a modest grey suit, before I stand, my hands hold and some determinants such as:" so, let's throw at a closer look. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's throw at a glance."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of SoHos is slow at its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers are based - there is still a handful of fantastic turntables."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various males in such shops and try to estimate their age and minds through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I spoke of Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle age) to Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops in order to fill a few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this sound plate, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot per e-mail, I'm not followed by it), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such significant number of albums and singles, the result of his available income is: it is now able to buy records, which he could not afford to buy and re-selling items he sold when he was young and plexed."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late '60s, early 70's, which appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things I probably was too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"it's true to those who buy records, rather introverted, and likes to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink much. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my truck.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Wez, 25, who is working with Sister Ray, believes many customers that he meets the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by Medienhpe, people who have heard about comeback and to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"of the conversations I have led, people usually have insulted their collection in the rule of 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers that once sold their records in order to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of slabs?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes only a few seconds in a shop, like Phonica, to realise that record shops offers a soothing community of equal opportunities."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers joined the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world, and would like to withdraw into the stability of trusty tracks, of objects which watch happy juxderangement."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think it can be the colt of a void, or possession of material owners as a kind of comfort," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collectors so and I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" soldered a staff of one plate stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought a record last month, they haven't heard it yet."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a turntables that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at that time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I blows the stack of Bossa Nova Komkami."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle age) works, has a" trophy "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came out recently here and said:" "I don't have a turntables, but I would like to buy a radio head record that I can put it into the shelf." "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musician."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not elderly, who will start slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"opp, which has devoted the sound of records almost a whole floor, has a bentertaining audience when I am clean."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists, the photos, teens and middle ages."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest Synthesizer- and sexist pop instead of experimental jazz drans from the speakers - is it good to see such diversity in the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks terrible, but nailing psychic traumas are badly detectable, if one stands next to someone for about 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around in the business for a few minutes, looking at the premises of the sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a mannequin to buy a large shopping carton.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve much, therefore the collecting of records does not contain real option, says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or to another way, but the beauty of records is..." it drives with a dearest sighing. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a shop, which is said that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired: urban Outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I admit to graze the jeans-Hotpants, I observe a group of young girls who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Crosley plate player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a blend of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only pure decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record-art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction to these items mean more money to the industry and send some customers to the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, even the one that is the most suitable for luxury objects such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they leave at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers, which exist in reality, record shops and in Onlineforen exist."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they don't spend their Thursday morning with safety by turnouts at Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they abstain from the starry view of an uncanny, 30-year-old false host who rises above the shoulders of middle age."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisory shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be fugitive to selling 72 Provisional shops in which persons within the camp goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, hairdresser's services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisory restaurants."</seg>

<seg id="6">"in addition, they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary business, but admitted that the concerns of the Calais prefecture are absolutely traceable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes, and restaurants would play a much bigger role as people live, who live in extremely preconical conditions."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the impressive performance of Great Britain in the 7-er Rugby arrived in the final on Thursday night at a disrupted stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 in the Deodorus stage here."</seg>

<seg id="4">"the defeat was won by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - the Great Britain's fourth on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament that they could be proud in New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>

<seg id="6">But in this form a 15-man team had been beaten in the shape of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a solace for GB - but it will probably not be - that at least a brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis chef Ben Ryan, former chef for England from Wimbledon. "</seg>

<seg id="9">She lost eight years ago with Ryan every game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>

<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou put a further weak tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion took a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is as if Fiji had been born in Fiji, to play 7, while GB is still not included."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB introduced basic changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova had gone through a brilliant interplay of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started a study of GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran long in favour of the South Korean Consuls, whose fans snakes, flags, and dancing at the tribune."</seg>

<seg id="4">"even though there were only the applause, who were sitting at the rest, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of trainers Robin Williams, was omnipresent as they took part for the second Olympics in a row without tax wife, the first women in the history of the British Sports that laid out such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolute, after all their 39.ter unlocked deployment, which is also unprecedented."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant Athletins, which reflects on the surface with the elegance of vibration, which is not reflected the kind of triumphes to geese."</seg>

<seg id="9">"I had the bladder cancer, which is operable and they did so."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, it spreads anywhere."</seg>

<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the rowing is already a challenge, but it makes it even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the invisibility of victory, their first thoughts went on Williams who spent a more annoying tomorrow to speak more than anything else and thus trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"panning that was in action as captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in an use in Afghanistan," I was a emotional wreck. that's perhaps something extremely, but it means so much. "</seg>

<seg id="27">"the couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponent could not keep up."</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>

<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to make something Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">"today we wanted no fireworks, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Ursel Kipp has accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching study she finished the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings for a senior choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, merry and more living, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"very next door, she does good with her health and spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"for singing, there is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior League."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in choir, sharing the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"by regular merging, elderly social contacts can bind and maintain."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as frequently, social and familial structures occur at the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has made a prisel Kipp in her choir:" to arrange and organise themselves, to be able to leave the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of collage. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"can sing in the positive sense, Hackler writes."</seg>
<seg id="12">Because they exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">"whoever calls his lung regularly, is not so fast in everyday use as fast as the puste."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even if it comes to get the sound of the voice at the age, Singen is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, the joint singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, explains them."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz frequently observed that singing, or hearing songs in elderly people many memories are aroused, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through Liedtexte and particularly melodies, people have depressed people against long-present events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in case of singing, a special achievement is required, Lenz explains."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focus on their own voice and to concentrate on a set rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that's a major cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"elderly people who live alone, do not just practice themselves on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one drives by singing in the choir, Hackler writes."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is also growing by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show yourself: if I do a bit of something, I will feel better and grow beyond me - that experience."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start with singing, so there's enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if you want to try a new hobby, do not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent is advisable."</seg>
<seg id="28">"not you are singing alone - at 50 sinking people, who is listening to, if a tone is going on it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the appropriate offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">Someone sings from the well-known circle in a geriatenchesor can easily be connected.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">"whoever wants to sing in a church choir can be addressed directly to the church or church rulers."</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior managers are also found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you have no access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with the Internet."</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Games of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolins"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, the Olympic Games are."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the Rio de Janeiro's events will feel resistant and unavoidable, a roaring relay between competition and strebs."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which will protect from the wrists to the swimmers to the triathlon."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can not switch to the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue at Coffeshop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there's Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is part of the Olympics for the first time and a crackling of women with dimples, could definitely be able to be sent to Prime Time as it would be a swimmers, Turner or even Fugly."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting in the Olympic trampolines around gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not lit for any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shade, there are sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol grip, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest and may reign over long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I don't really want to make arguments for my particular favorites, then let me draw attention on the discrete charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampolinlets have already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it was in Sydney, it was really noticeable that many people had questioned that I had questioned, did not know that it is a Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"even though the United States sent athletes to the competition, it has never gained a medal in the trampolines and had a athlete until 2012, who managed it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong in China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampolinjump has a certain outdoor area, partly because it sounds for the undefiled ear suitable for a clownsschool as those sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a paid enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonary trembling of his never-pointed out - but also the Grazie of gyms and diving, the two sports, which combines it essentially."</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline which means a lot like "jumping board."</seg>
<seg id="22">"firing winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, real and saltos) before they finish at the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympic program, you will be rated according to execution, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"two and thirty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medalliances must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and above, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes going and back, down and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also another polite target: in the world or the Olympiad."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal is nobel, admired, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I myself in looking at these games as something tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an air break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline jumping is up.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"it or she prallles, seemingly heavy like an astronaut, goes upwards, then downwards, then effortlessly upward."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, just the dreaming, elegant preparation of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be in the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final dogs of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also about 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final times as part of a supplement block at both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia-Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when the increase of consciousness is only achieved by attackers and objectification of male athletes - like the male US Turner, according to the The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley awaits its kind of ripening, new fans."</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">"demonstrators, the political changes in Ethiopia call for violent resistance to the government."</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that four protesters were killed during clashes with the police in firework.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the last ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid-growing West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the past months, protests against the government shook the country and expanding its regions."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people clicked on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the answer of the government was merciful."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen shot unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, video about the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, are showing how security sleeper young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The UN Authority for Human Rights now demands an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was still difficult to maintain this country and future will even become more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians together to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa when ever, get as much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Ethiopia's economy expanded in a considerable pace."</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new train in Addis Ababa's capital.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are generally quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia was all other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations, constantly led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, dissidents were effectively taken into silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or into prison, or were killed in the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"when you suppress People and have no other options to protest, it breaks out," "said Seym Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">"there are numerous complaints, which cover everything from land use up to worms in relation to power of the ruling coalition."</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions along the border to Eritrea, a battle for this flickling, disputed line challenged in June hundreds of life."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts are afraid that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were forced more or less forced to attack the turbulences in recent years, and could be armed again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of propontiation after years of tension explode under the surface now.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in the last years many Ethiopian were able to communicate with the social media, because cheap smartphones were increasingly becoming more common and the Internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government closed down access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate via Internet Proxies to hide where they stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said they were so at protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since Etons, the Amharas, the predominantly Christian countries, are in politics and economy, while they exploited Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowlands."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in the intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the disturbances is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"after his death in 2012, Mr Meles, a former rebel leaders, was killed by the death of Ethiopia to his death in the year 2012."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was particularly active in it, to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special contractors to handle opponents and to make them unharmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing on this legendary event," Mr Abdi said, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively uncautious reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the tigray region of the north of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he enjoys not trust the trust of the tigray controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia experienced such an uproar in 2005, after thousands against elections protested, which, according to the declarations of the government, was decisively stolen by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following Razcia, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the past few months, and this time of unrest was passed relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for its visionary infrastructure planning, as the new production train, as well as its measurable advances in poverty."</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this did not prevent the intention of internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protests in Gondar, a amharic city, served by Tigray, and the hatred toward the Tigray is always more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests like the United States and other Western allies are bringing in a unique position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though she recently decided that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"during the West, clearly wants to support democracy, he doesn't want to ban his ally in an already volatile country."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," Mr Abdi said, "is a very thin free migration."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump tells his claim Obama was founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy on Friday, showing his campaign that his multi-repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the" founders "of the Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification set new questions on communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Republicans - whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandable to the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings together his fellow soldier, who strive to take him during an eventful phase in protection, in the curious position to explain any statement that he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after he had made the clarification at a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump made reference to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to signify that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was contrary to the previous day, Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation perfectly seriously."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to refuse the statement a little weaker, that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him, the Republican Presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism bouncing on Mr. Trump while he tried to draw the focus of his campaign due to falling circumference measures to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject."</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clint's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he found her speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm into his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he moved to himself when he said that the Russians should not finalize Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later, of course, I said" Of course, "I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows for Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic borders in politics and then return to rowing.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, as they arrive, and then" clear "according to how the reaction falls." "Ruth Sherman, a communication trainer, who observed the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also think he's smart enough to keep his testimonies, so that they can be interpreted in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has received an estimate of its tone, since its circumscriptions have gone back."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a big advantage in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally attempting to apologize for his provocative statements, he is accused of understanding his critics or to understand his recommendation."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is intensified in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze launched his loyal co-streiter into the uncomfortable situation, irrespective of how provokant may be his testimony."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps prominent principals, gave great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani so he asked about the correctness of Mr. Trumps of statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in this sense, true that Obama had an almost unknown, small organization, he called her back-brokers, completely false and therefore it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, as Secretary of State, served ISIS to spread out ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and worshipped them, on each of his words, and to be voiced against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he defied the" poor, "miserable" television experts who try to understand him and said, "You can't." "</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest cyclone is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-haie usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board of the Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a fine 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenlandhaie are only received with 150 years offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Greenlandhai Greenlandhai drives up at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour he is just 1,220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it depends on it accelerates the five meter long animal on a full 2.6 km / h - and it is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle characterised by loneliness, but seems to be a bullet for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen, University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported his colleagues in the professional journal" Science "in any of Greenland's 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Schranlein of the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the evolutionary biologist presumed for a long time that Grönlandhaie stone become old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence were missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-haie are hard to observe, finally they live especially in the ice sea in front of the thin populated coast of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they appear usually only in the winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Scientists know little about the lifestyle of Greenland-haie.</seg>
<seg id="17">"her time-bends left them, as they hit six animals with a transmitter."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the sharks make this sharks: in the stomach of a animal researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed up the orbony of a young polar bears."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly, they hunt sleeping animals or patrouters at the bottom of the ice Sea and are looking for cadaver, the upper water layers back down."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland-haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was only 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 cm measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of animals, they analyzed the lens in the hair with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this center of the eye lens arises before the birth of sharks, which contained proteins are not renewed later."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of Carbon-14 in the lens cleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear arsenal tests are trying to lock larger amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in contrast to 220 centimeters in length, the lenticular core contained a low excess of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all larger Greenlandhaie had a normal carbon-14-quantities, which produces cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-Clock was seen for a 493-centimetre Greenland at the age of 335 or even 392 years old while the record-Hai should be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Grönlandhai-females become only offspring, if they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Researchers now able to assign the researchers of the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably is on the threshold for sexually mature, and its age was 156 years old, Greenland's haie with the proliferation obviously can be seen at least one and a half century."</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methzaleme live especially in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland whale, stuck in the bacon on the neck of a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures often, the organism from the animals live on sparkle."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and altern slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The loss of heat from one gram of mouse is much larger than 4 grams of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"thus, a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on it as many offspring as possible," explains the Evolutionary biologist Schranlein as possible. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very large animal, however, should invest his resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="15">"but even at the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" breakout model "of their generation - under the former category falls, it is in good society."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms which resemble climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have been referred to with her hot, water-less surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">"scientists have previously mentioned that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, inventive-like atmosphere, and still turned out slowly."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably pointed out more dry areas as de Earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to accomodate life and shake vigorously fast."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposed their daily side of the Sun almost two months," GISS Scientists Anthony Del Genio stated in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which seems like an umbrella, to cover the surface of a large part of solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the result are average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than the Earth today."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model brought a history of Venus, which resembles the evolution that was suspected of planet."</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was supposedly habitable, Venus was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans are darkened and their water vapor was burned down from ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of compressive malware - present security companies - and are successful thereby.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of the Malwarebytes, based on 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies surveyed have at least once, partly several times a victim of an attack with pressors."</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany almost 20 percent of companies have already been the goal of a Ransomware detection.</seg>
<seg id="5">"40 percent of the victims paid by the perpetrators requested by the perpetrators, to be able to use the challenged systems and data again."</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their fingerprint software according to the observation of Malwarebytes to attack the company network.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to differentiate ransom are considerably higher than in private use."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a scary rapid evolution of the pollutants," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of them were designed to give advertising to advertisements."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators brought the perpetrators software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the goal, but the change to company attacking was quickly scary in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"after a simple pattern, Ransomware is working according to a simple pattern: once upon the computer of an opter, they are searching for irregular files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the Ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Afterwards the software covers the demands of the pressors.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims must have money - mostly in the form of the cryptoga bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where on private use the personal photo database is on the game, it is responsible for companies to sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage fails, if a ransomware suggests."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely break into business activity, where people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by loss of hospitals."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: pay not, you will only support the problem," "says Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of the companies pay, their data will be back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the perpetrators, in view of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, researchers from F-Secure have investigated the user surface and contact with the compressors and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"you explain to their victims, as they can pay per Bitcoin, direct support websites or decrypt for example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and will repaid individuals for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to pay partly hard to negotiate and pay five digits of sum to withdraw their data."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomware detection, hackers become increasingly professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski from the Antivirus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"more likely, however, is that it is about three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software building to the actual print.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware kits, including the malware, consulting and additional tools for a one-time fixed price, were purchased between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in the scope of delivery, a customization pool such as small configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The pressors are looking for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so one logging in one of the forums on the underground, buying the set of a criminal and tasked another to install the software on possible many PCs."</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is carried per infiable calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals then instructed spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that guarantee their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">"over 50 per cent of the companies responsible for companies in the Malwarebytes survey, Ransomware is able to withstand ransomware by file-back-ups and scannersoftware."</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat for successful embarrassing more, the perpetrators instead of the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or quotations," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"thereby, the damage can be more than before, depending on the type of data."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the perpetrators, too, could take entirely new objectives on the Internet of things to do."</seg>
<seg id="43">"at the hacker conference, defcon demonstrating the safety researcher, as they could obtain a thermostat on the Internet connected to their control."</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the free folding of a derart blocked heating so much sacrifice is quite a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators then switch to a factory in the future instead of the heating in the future, ransomware could also be a topic in the Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="4">"sounds quite reloaded, but the HR-V, which has been constructed on the same new platform, as the new jazz has been designed in everyday life as extremely flexible."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the only 1.60 m heighted HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in Fond, there is no space."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the interior materials of the interior are well processed and very comfortable, only the cockpit-top is falling there."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, you are wandering around in the evening, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning there is no longer thinking about sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">That's all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one has such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep sleeping disorders and over ten percent, their sleep frequently are frequent or permanent than not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How are sleeping problems or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there are many different causes of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society of Sleepers and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as you understand landscly, but it's not an input and sleep disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"many people feel straight through to sleep unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagner's needing, member of the German Household association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"beyond this, organic, psychological or behavioral factors are able to stick out medications but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleep disorder expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early wake is especially for depression frequently," says Weeß. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"and it may be, that various factors can thank each other."</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a herniated disc, can be bad, woken up all two to three hours, and starts to pondering over everyday problems and worry, wears a example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you sleep with sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who does not sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights per week, should go to the doctor, says Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look quite differently: it is cast down, tired, insufficient, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood changes or physical problems such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve the sleep disorder, it is important to find their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as a treatment options, there are behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or other medicines - classic sleeping chains only in exceptional case and no more than two weeks - inquire."</seg>
<seg id="22">"sleeping alcohols in Germany hardly, he emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fibers, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Charité University of Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, at sleeping difficulties, one should first apply to the doctor, says Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="24">Research can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who was to sleep in sleep laboratory and what is going on?</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the sleep laboratory medicine, medicine for example in snoring with breathing difficulties, in illness of disease-fatigue, at bedtime or if you do not find the cause of a passage of sleep, explains Fires."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not only make a nap," says Fires. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the wipes, one goes to the bed in its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to electrodes at the body you can carry a nose goggles, a chest strap and a feelight on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">A camera on the ceiling is also drawn up on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected problems get in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">"there are quite many positions, where one can apply for better sleep."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Weeß is based on: regular sleep and standing time, not too long in bed, don't sleep to sleep, do not watch TV to sleep, and don't watch TV at the clock - then you start to calculate immediately, and that is quite and certainly not favorably."</seg>

<seg id="5">"articles about this" trendy city "," as the responsible real estate firm Friedrichshain calls, will be preferred by burning cars in the last few weeks. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile, the residents of the rental contracts, on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year several times, the Berlin internal enigator Henkel had been a tough approach to support the project, the area referred to as" No-Go Zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, patrouded the police three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three club cars on site, locked parts of the street and held visitors from leaving the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, the newly renovated building worker commissioned the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin administrative court decided that the evacuation was illegal, and a day later, police and workers moved under the juwels of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road seems peacefully: parents walk with children walking and people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun and others talk to prem late.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the hood, there are a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left force is not the main concern of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who stands here three children, mainly from the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the residents of the skin projects, they share the concern against increasing mites and ventrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez who wanted to repay the left policyprotection from vandalating left.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, the Berlin Internal Market and the police have up their neighbours, evidently not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working district, which today also fell in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average and high poverty risk."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied by the former German Democratic Republic, including nearly the entire Main Street, which were close to the Rigs."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the mainboards had been cleared in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the neighborhood has become increasingly becoming the magnets for tourists and voting liner from all over the world: with them, the natives of GDR times and former home network have become their maxim."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the case, which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigs are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognizing them on the designed slices or freshly painted facades that were thrown into rings.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned in this year together with the words "left-autonomous force."</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for this, that not all neighbours may have a problem, could be that they are not affected by crime: crimes such as body injury, statistics used almost exclusively against police officers."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the most important part of the criminal offences make material damage, which is rather the new built and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rental house next 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, cannot be speech of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for violence, it is appeased: people in the 94 are their neighbours, that they have not been determined."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars also give it straight to the Rigaer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for those who studied architect, her road is no criminal spot, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, live together on the road and get more of each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is stuck in the Rigaer street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"therefore, it was so important that the residents of the residents get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media that suddenly stressed the interpretation of the district in July."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of inhabitants as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: by pressing tonless reconstructions in former builders, who are pushing the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"finally, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many - here are rather people who are not so good," says she. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction, I can absolutely not guise."</seg>
<seg id="35">"but what should I do, if any one has never heard?"</seg>
<seg id="36">"on all sides of frustration, there is also among the police and the residents."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for concessions that had little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">"who draws, should be aware of this - just like someone who is moving into a pub district where you can complain about noise."</seg>

<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed lead, practice sessions, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants are to be arranged or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house master, do-profit work - and motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">"activity, however, does not mean work."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and Customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a conceiving feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so there are offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and honorary posts.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are allowed in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you have to explain the refugees that it takes and they can cover the time sensible, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who eventually develop the feeling, he could not work in Urbach, do not work and be unprofitable, who will never integrate himself."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there is also no problem," says customer honestly, "people in which nothing goes." the work of Deuschle and Customer may always be motivating others too. "</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: did the two have been afraid of radicalization, even in a small municipality like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine customer clearly says clearly, "what mancher naiv may call." but if you could not exclude any residual risk and does not want to exclude it. "</seg>
<seg id="50">"sensitively, the helpers are already sensitive."</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the topic of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have been afraid that the attacks bring them completely in obituary.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So major and honorary posts have to hold out in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new push of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer the politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach where we would like to go," "Annika Deuschle says."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, this would relax its location."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher has already been fully utilized to integrate the previous people sensible.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"however, when people are in need, they have to help them, both women are united."</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated there is no easy answers.</seg>
