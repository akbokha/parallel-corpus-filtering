Obama receives recommendation
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to proceed to the implementation of the international agreement as well as moving into dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; however , there is also the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relation between Obama and Netanyahu has been ten@@ sion@@ ed since years .
Washington critic@@ ises the constant municipal construction of Israel and continues to reject his peace process .
&quot; through the course of Obama , the Iranian nuclear program has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship of both . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu had invited an invitation to Rep@@ ublic@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partially exploited by Obama &apos;s affair . &quot;
&quot; the speech did not speak to Obama , this meeting was rejected with regard to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in a emergency call , Professor , his girlfriend has been shot &quot;
&quot; in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon said with a somewhat delicate voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials at his house would have to come . &quot;
&quot; lamb was harder to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but I &apos;m still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officials found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note , which was on a white block , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed from Lamb . &quot;
&quot; said lamb , which was set up in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , which was set up in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , which he had already shot and killed some 300 miles on the school grounds , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door leading to his office . &quot;
&quot; Delta State University Po@@ eb@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said , that University staff members have heard about 10 : 18 hrs . &quot;
&quot; he said , suggested that he made a cat@@ astro@@ phic emergency call sometime during the day . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : the Lamb had taken life when police killed him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting in the university , students and lec@@ turers assist in hiding behind closed doors , the authorities still try to make a picture of what was motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the men from both ends of the state were published , such as that which students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students said they were delighted with his teaching .
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ent@@ iss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; Lamb is mentioned in one of his books , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both were station@@ ed in the Department of Social Sciences and History , which comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ ines to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ours .
&quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ eck , who praised the Lamb , said , &quot; he was too excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; a student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes told him that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; lamb had previously been asked to have asked the Delta State University for health reasons , which said that he has any health problem . &quot;
&quot; this year , he set just two online courses . &quot;
&quot; most important changes in the University &apos;s employment policy , that the promotion , which was worked hard for the Lamb , would provide no warranty for a automatic way to be considered as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; however , University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he had nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs demonstrate . &quot;
&quot; if the Lamb is no answer , these are questions . &quot;
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track as he drove back in Mississippi with Arkan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , he killed them with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents &quot; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why they went to this house , but Johnson said she knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew in the area .
&quot; jum@@ per began working on the university in 2009 , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants studied and under@@ graduate in geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he did his doctorate in ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs called him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Carla Hair@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb as she met by mutual friends . &quot;
&quot; they and their friends were in High School , and he was the cool old guy who tried some years to teach her guitar . &quot;
he was a s@@ warm among women at the time .
&quot; all girls have melted away when he was there , &quot; Hair@@ ston , now 40 years ago in the Jackson &apos;s subur@@ ban of Bran@@ don . &quot;
jum@@ per and Pr@@ ent@@ ate were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call said &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no document from a marriage . &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick @-@ house where was ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; it was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ge@@ en said about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; Oh &apos; ste@@ en said , &apos; he never met , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he has heard that Lamb has been interested in music and playing blues . &quot;
&quot; lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ iss , as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came next three years ago in a summer decade . &quot;
later they played together the one or other gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Bo@@ en said , his daughter is writing and sings their own music . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ ree was a nurse going for different enterprises online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar near G@@ auti@@ er said that he didn &apos;t have finished his guitar and harmon@@ ious Night at Night 5 for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ious audience . &quot;
there were no signs that something was not right .
&quot; he simply said a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clean@@ up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good meaning for kid@@ ding .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester teaching programme and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell said a English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied in the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was President of the Brotherhood and the student Committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State campus , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle light . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Sch@@ mid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the captain over the &quot; &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot; &quot;
the course of classes is resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported to Cleveland that Mississippi .
&quot; the authors of Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police had said that Lamb had shot on the emergency call , and that lamb had been shot in his emergency call Pr@@ ent@@ iss as his wife , but there is no indication of that the two have ever married . &quot;
Toys R Us plans to display fewer workers for the Christmas season

Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with prin@@ cess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat at the theater as well as I realize that the seat is empty next to me , and it becomes gradually clear that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;

UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; ban Ki @-@ moon speaking Secretary @-@ Secretary Ban Ki @-@ moon , his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of nearly five years of armed conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief demands once again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and promote inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Minister of the five member member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the outskirts of the general meeting of the general meeting even in this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the insur@@ rection in the Council and the Syrian people , and the regional powers , make this situation dis@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
ban formally asked for the five permanent members to show the crisis in Syria to show the same solidarity and unity being demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 fol@@ ks showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is taking seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others got him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Republican ublic@@ ans try , Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper slopes at the p@@ olls upper , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national p@@ olls conducted Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously wonder what it means for the nomin@@ ation of the nomin@@ ation of real estate . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republican nomin@@ ation .
&quot; experts refer to Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership to the Asc@@ ending Herman , in 2011 , none of which gained a state in the nom@@ inees process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have strug@@ gled in a general election .
but external groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ es Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps staying power and start falling to overthrow their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current predic@@ tions that indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul isn &apos;t just a temporary stage is :
dro@@ um@@ ps During storage values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate business Mog@@ ul . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep themselves in the early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac @-@ vote in Iowa witnessed that 60 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of fle@@ ets .
two thirds of GO@@ P elec@@ tors R@@ P would be happy with ump than candidates .
&quot; in a CNN / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans stated they were either &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if jun@@ ta was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; up@@ set , &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son makes about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about jun@@ ctions ) . &quot;
the next in terms of excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; off@@ ended &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans may see Tr@@ um@@ ps speci@@ f@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Republican voters think that the real estate Mog@@ ul says the right tem@@ per for a pre@@ sidents , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first in@@ discri@@ min@@ ate state of the nation , State of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans think he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent still think that he won &apos;t have the personality to effectively implement his office , and almost six out of 10 Independent people say that his tem@@ per is not the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republican voters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their money , Republican voters think of Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked , who wins the most likely the GO@@ P @-@ nomin@@ ation won , according to a CNN / OR@@ C survey from the past week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s a change since the time , when four from ten ended July their money to Je@@ b Bush . &quot;
full coverage : GO@@ P voters had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans stated that Rick Per@@ ry win the nomin@@ ation would win only 28 % for final candidates . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , a multitude of the GO@@ P @-@ voters of Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign demonstrates a plau@@ sible campaign . &quot;
&quot; even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump proposes almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the frag@@ itter@@ ing field probably contributes to tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Support has spread to more than a dozen of other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey conducted by the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head between Tr@@ ump and the other Republican candidates , Tr@@ ump is harvested by majority support . &quot;
&quot; he recently reached Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points ahead , ahead of Walker 15 points ahead of J@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christie 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who kills him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a short@@ listed majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says they have formed their opinion .
&quot; a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday will show that only slightly more than half of voters going , the Tr@@ ump says they have voted against their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , there can be much to change that , and no one can tell you never the opinion . &quot;
&quot; 46 per cent said they leave the door open , changing to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters that they have formed in their opinion are twice as frequent as Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they match with Tr@@ ump on the theme of Immig@@ ration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign in front of two months immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; rape , &quot; the immigration and possibility of fishing was held in the public dis@@ course of 2016 . &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic im@@ prints of b@@ ump @-@ wide Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans are being captured by the Republican Party and will damage the re@@ orientation effort .
&quot; but according to the new ABC / Post pol@@ l of Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they match with Tr@@ ump in issues of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration remains in the lim@@ el@@ ight , there Donald Tr@@ ump appears to do as well . &quot;
the fru@@ stration among the government peaks on new high@@ s .
&quot; meanwhile , on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , there are roughly half the support of Republican elec@@ tors , especially by its out@@ si@@ der status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa ublic@@ ans will seem fru@@ str@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans at Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; fat@@ ally . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential buildings in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg are the most expensive community residence - with view over the North Sea desert .
&quot; in the street , a flat square meter facility costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is no natural , it says in the study - hence the high price . &quot;
&quot; a new study shows , in which particular layers are a square meter . &quot;
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; unlike most of Germany &apos;s top locations , however , one of the price is similar to Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
&quot; the real estate provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers publishes a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites , with square met@@ er@@ rates in dizz@@ ying heights . &quot;
&quot; there are several thousand Euros not - per square meter , well noticed . &quot;
but doing well who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is quite an exception here at the top .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream @-@ start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ time sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
&quot; a lucky surprise by Thomas Müller paved the way to FC Bayern for a well @-@ earned 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus , and then it was running . &quot;
a sovereign start of the Champions League @-@ season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze started a dream atri@@ cal release in Milan &apos;s &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; by Pi@@ raeus . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers twin pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Got@@ s matches ( 8@@ 9th ) to 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth strong race in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to take the h@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third place . &quot;
&quot; Müller was awarded the International Champion in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership of the Olympic Committee at his 28 . arrived at the Champions League , the head of the world champion to pass through . &quot;
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 of hot fans - and the Munich firm left . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus won his most six home games in the Royal class , including major clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria , in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , won &apos;t want to be the next victims . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often into their vig@@ orous efforts . &quot;
the attacks were issued too often by playing on the link outside Douglas Costa which has rarely passed against the previous Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller was suddenly more fortunate than his fl@@ ank out of the right hemisphere in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion promised the possible 2 : 0 .
&quot; in the past occasions , Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski had the best occasions in half . &quot;
&quot; at first , the Olymp@@ ian @-@ Stür@@ mer Brown on the head of Poland struck the top ball from the line ( 26th ) . &quot;
&quot; then , by direct withdrawal , the Tor@@ e@@ wart broke with his knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; even though the Bavaria comes to domin@@ ate the elegant game , Pi@@ raeus was able to catch the dot blocks . &quot;
but Manuel New was a decree .
&quot; so , when he set a shot of ide@@ ye on the bar ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; new Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided to defend a city with David Al@@ aba in the centre , next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back at the ca@@ viar , sat first sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup @-@ Hero have only given the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; said Chief Financial Officer Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; if you want to do something else , that &apos;s quite mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and his first change decided to attack him when he launched King@@ sley Com@@ an for the eliminated Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
&quot; Mr. Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear to about 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ eter , he still has one on top . &quot;
before the game there was come to Kra@@ w@@ ander in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partial tari@@ um@@ med Bavarian fans clearly prov@@ oked the supporters of Gary Pi@@ raeus having words and gest@@ ures , the security forces seized and entered the Munich p@@ endants . &quot;
at least a Bavaria @-@ fan was injured in the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; the smo@@ kes , it hur@@ ts not only the lungs , but also the teeth , that puts Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study at hand . &quot;
the good news : when mi@@ xes decreases the risk quickly .
smoking permitted a clearly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to qu@@ itting smoking , smoking amounts to lose the risk of losing their teeth in order to 3.6 @-@ 3,6 times higher . &quot;
&quot; the scientists had observed more than 24,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
&quot; causes of dental surgery may be cav@@ ities and infections of gum disease , the DI@@ f@@ E st@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of tooth can therefore return to frequent g@@ ing@@ iv@@ itis in cat@@ er@@ holes .
&quot; to how long , smoking is also increased the risk of c@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; men who stopped smoking at smoking could actually decrease their risk within a short time , the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take more than ten years until the threat back to the level of qu@@ itting smoking , the first @-@ author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; they argu@@ ed that men were convinced , smoking , the manager H@@ einer has been causing a Boeing by DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; they will smoke the life time . &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and vessels and leads to our findings to a good dental health to the high age .
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years is affected by denti@@ sts , the DI@@ f@@ E divided . &quot;
previous studies have already noted that smoking increases the risk of early tooth power .
the new long @-@ term study covers the findings .

&quot; from text messages have been known , that on the spot in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have experienced a church , explained below . &quot;
&quot; apart from the remains of the fortress and the church in Kyrgy@@ z@@ stan , there was also a cemetery of around 350 tom@@ bs which belonged probably to the church . &quot;

EU Commission recommends a new court in dispute over the TT@@ IP
&quot; for the dispute against the planned trans@@ atl@@ antic trade agreement , the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial of private services for disp@@ utes between concert and states are to be replaced by a transparent system , which is reflected in its functionality more with more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; we want to al@@ ign one system which will trust the citizens , &quot; explained the responsible EU @-@ Com@@ par@@ ity Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström when she launched the idea . &quot;
the Swe@@ de to introduce the proposal as European negoti@@ ating position into the free trade talks with the USA .
the German Government announced support .
TT@@ IP will create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans on reform of the current arbit@@ rators can be seen specifically that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new investment plan .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the USA and third countries . &quot;

Jeremy Cor@@ niche &apos;s debut in the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns is eag@@ erly a@@ waited in the hold of the prime minister of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n should have his debut at the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister , and for the first time he let David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to the first of his six pre@@ defined questions shortly after noon , with his performance by the media most likely and the Labour MPs from the nearby . &quot;
he required &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could jump some meetings to leave them colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns lead , since it was named after his appointment to the member of the ch@@ att@@ endant , and his speech at the TU@@ C @-@ Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the decision of the Labour president , on Tuesday during the sin@@ cer@@ ity of the National an@@ them , prov@@ oked a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , cr@@ iti@@ que of a number of T@@ ory M@@ PS prov@@ okes and is the focus of several cover page stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision , not to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention &quot;
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ l said he had &quot; in respec@@ t@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ic battle of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ en Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the Labour leader to chant the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his faith that the monarchy should be abolished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of the shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and it appe@@ aled to differences with regard to the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than one @-@ sixth of the Parliamentary Party was originally supported as a guide . &quot;
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Wright says that political differences were also st@@ ack@@ able within the Labour ... and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s declar@@ ations to the position of the European Union and the limit .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that the Labour change , to remove the whole idea of limitation in overall . &quot;
&quot; later on , Mr Smith , the shadow of labor and pensions agreed that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to a 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth incar@@ nation , David Cameron , since he is leader of T@@ ory leader in the past decade , over the Disp@@ atch @-@ Box in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour Leader who promised another policies , says &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP has said that the question of the prime minister is that prime minister , and that he will under@@ take both &quot; impact strength &quot; and the stre@@ aks along with contradic@@ tions and instead , to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minister , will represent him , if he is not participating - for example , when Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into discussion that other colleagues held the word on occasions , and that he used John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , asked to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron promised that he would be able to remove from politics into a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le The@@ aters , &quot; which is often associated with the question of the Prime Minister . however , a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; when they were broadcast on television first in 1990 , the fra@@ grant was watched as the ver@@ ge of a leader in the fore@@ front of his leadership and his position under his par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed that they have become a caric@@ ature and require a reaching reforms . &quot;

&quot; the pound increased substantially to data , which indicate a rise in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was enhanced by the T@@ ot@@ sz@@ iel SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9 % over the same period of the same year . &quot;
this percentage was the fastest and earned ass@@ essments at the time of interest rates since 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar on $ 1.@@ 550@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared with the Euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 index reached an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding stock in the market and made a jump of 20 % , after the take @-@ over offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v . &quot;

the CEO of J@@ D Sports predic@@ ts that more wages are dangerous .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will out@@ perform the higher labor costs by his company , he says . &quot;

Peg@@ i@@ da poster brings benefits on potato @-@ ön@@ er @-@ idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; it is both - and in the m@@ ashed potatoes , the Han@@ i Al@@ hay shop , the Ol@@ den@@ nes owner . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the award &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ i@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat were put on a sk@@ e@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Peg@@ i@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; , &quot; which he had seen at random in television . &quot;
&quot; since then , a bar@@ bec@@ e@@ wer system is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multi@@ stage for the stomach , &quot; said Al@@ hay . &quot;
Lebanese government has meanwhile arrived in patent offices in Munich .
&quot; there , according to the authority , the agency has recently been protected as utility models . &quot;

Met@@ ric starts launching of the excav@@ ation campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - in@@ fest@@ ation
cash is trying to protect IG@@ A stores from a Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ allic has launched a ground @-@ relief campaign in order to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di is opening up the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Str@@ at@@ tics and IG@@ A markets strengthen its relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand by mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events such as Adelaide Show . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ A tra@@ ders and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as ice manufacturers soci@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distri@@ butes samples and shop owners who sell allied tickets to the South Australian Football League and faithful customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ res will publish more details of its Defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler being conducted for food , alcohol and devices through its annual investors @-@ strategy . &quot;
it stands much on the game since South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shops and higher profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in Eastern countries .
&quot; purch@@ aser in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial or IG@@ A retailers have a much more powerful market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland , more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia as opposed to around 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts as Morgan Stanley believes that Al@@ di is s@@ nat@@ ching some five percent of the food market in these two states following the opening of his first markets , but mainly independently individual retailers and sales . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley that IG@@ A @-@ retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million of revenues per year and met@@ a 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year , and posted a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and grocery and the amounts on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost met@@ a roughly 13 million in profit before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath told . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ res lost market shares in the eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey carried out by Roy Morgan that IG@@ A buyers are the faithful . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stanley took part in the fact that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenue in food and food market increased by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce its market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading Fon@@ ds@@ Manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , talked to Melbourne that met@@ abolic probably will likely van@@ ish within a decade . Met@@ ric will likely van@@ ish . &quot;
conclusions to react to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it assumes that a board member of Met@@ ric &#91; Mr Dou@@ glass had taken contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ As &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which is roughly 1,200 IG@@ A retailers , is fallen by 43 percent , which reflects the operating debt reduction in terms of turnover and mar@@ gins since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler being denied , however , inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ , to add sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week , improving increasing food products and provide a better selection of private label food . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Chief Executive Officer , Ian Mor@@ rice says that for the first time in 2017 the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return to profit growth and hopes that wholes@@ al@@ ers will return to profit growth for the first time in the year 2017 . &quot;
&quot; Than@@ asi co@@ kin@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly , &quot;
Than@@ asi co@@ kin@@ is ear@@ ns rather praise as a criticism for his behavior .
&quot; Than@@ asi co@@ kin@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gios and ear@@ ns his opinion for his own behavior in the Australian tennis Federation , Steve He@@ aly , in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ ch@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special KS &quot; is moving into the spot@@ light with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying match in Cincinnati soon , co@@ ca@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison once had to be separated from the refer@@ ee , where Harrison who would have killed me : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have sm@@ ashed the child and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he finally saw a tennis ra@@ cket was destroyed , after a cr@@ amp@@ f overs@@ aw a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , co@@ ca@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ending from He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated me quite is the fact that after my view , Than@@ asi was a little bit in the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken down a bat with himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even amongst the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Harrison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ved a lot of recognition . &quot;
he has a great team around himself and he has a great family around himself and I think he was a bit too strictly to be treated .
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he does not have a problem with the other players , he is still trained in changing , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own services . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider the decision to make C@@ yr@@ dom in the important decision to take into consideration that on Friday , and it describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long lasting part into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the contro@@ versy around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I think that Nick climbed very quick to the A@@ scen@@ sion , on which people like Feder@@ er and Murray can have made . he raises and earned all the criticism that he gets , but we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his trading . it is best for the team and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; crisis of Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , includes the fron@@ tier , keeps refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary explains the emergency and inter@@ locks the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , held all the people trying to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the state flow of migrants . &quot;
chaos ensu@@ ed as hundreds of migrants responded to a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and a Serbian civil servants with indig@@ nation .
&quot; people who fled from violence , had been stuck for an unknown period in a strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built there and settled there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations took up .
&quot; as a police helicopter above them , the migrants &quot; opened their border ! &quot; and they cried out to the Hungarian Al@@ ri@@ ot police . &quot;
some exp@@ elled from protest food and water .
&quot; as Serbia &apos;s Minister of Foreign Affairs , it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; to be sent back to migrants from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ ally damage .
&quot; in the coming days of talks with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vic@@ a Dac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
&quot; the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serb border reached a day after the 28 @-@ hour blo@@ c at a strict meeting in Brussels , no common immigration policy could agree . &quot;
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who have fled to Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be concluded that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hung@@ arians , however , his hopes are not on a balanced action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency in two southern regions had given more authority in two southern regions to accelerate the crisis , so that they could accelerate streets and asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian minister of Foreign Affairs , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to , said that his country will also cover the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having finished a fence along the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata said that even prisoners in the race , to build the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia , were used . &quot;
&quot; in the last few months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are that in search of a better life , and not war refugees that are entitled to protection - a view that stands strongly in contra@@ diction to other EU states , among them Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws which came into effect at midnight in Hungary , crossing the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) in Za@@ hir , caused the government to build along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also constitute a greater detention of punishment for the traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation that emerged through the mass migration , the Hungarian Government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said government &quot; Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illeg@@ ally border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament still needs to agree on the application of the military , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orters of Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already on day . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , land @-@ security adviser for Or@@ ban , said that authorities made 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country . &quot;

authorities are there to quickly repair the fence .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , the Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos transferred the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and sting a crowd , in order to en@@ force themselves there . &quot;
&quot; some 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would spend food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead against Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
&quot; Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for the nomin@@ ation at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders will win their face toward the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic elec@@ torate in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase of 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who hasn &apos;t announced whether he &apos;s candidate for the presidential candidate , receives support for 15 percent of democratic voters . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , the majority of democratic voters say that it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion p@@ ains , which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ ics supporters are generally more resistant than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton had lost some gains during a row of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders made some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton keeps a big advantage in women and moderate , but these pre @-@ le@@ aps have reduced . &quot;
your support for the male has dropped significantly and S@@ anders is now with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has de@@ struc@@ tur@@ ally and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
but Clinton had a big advantage in the older voters .
&quot; last month , Clinton was with double @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the national voters say that they would support the Clinton &apos;s enthusiasm when they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reserved and yet another 15 percent would support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ ics got current supporters in particular of her .
the views are more mixed in those who currently not support Clinton - just about a quarter would support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of democratic elec@@ torate is the elec@@ torate that they will support the Clinton with enthusiasm , the Republican voters say this on their leading candidates Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 per cent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question , why they want the candidates , is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best can@@ did@@ acy for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
he also menti@@ ons Clinton &apos;s reports to Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval of dealing with problems and voters are also cited .
&quot; as the vice president prepar@@ es a potential for the presidency in the equation , 57 percent of the elec@@ torate will see him in the race - even though a third thinks he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if a democratic elec@@ torate is asked , who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is on the top . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ s An@@ ger &apos;s claim more than half that Bi@@ den would have their second choice , far from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den decides to predic@@ t the nomin@@ ation of the Democrats , does not increase Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead against S@@ anders , 20 points with Bi@@ den in competition for 30 points without it . &quot;
&quot; in fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters , Clinton see the candidate at the best chances of winning choice ; however , this number has dropped by 78 per cent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; chosen &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in any candidate , Democratic elec@@ torate call questions about voters . &quot;
similarly as in the last month no only Democratic candidate or potential candidate made clear candidate for this elec@@ torate is un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results with a few important features in the elec@@ tors by the party &apos;s elections .
&quot; consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; in three candidates , Bi@@ den accurately cuts the lead at hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have an opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; Democratic elec@@ tors of the elec@@ ts are generally depicted in Clinton , S@@ anders , and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; for all these measurements , about one @-@ quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal E @-@ mail address and a server continue to be asked during the term , most of the Democratic elec@@ torate is pleased with their declaration of the matter and say that their opinions will not affect overall . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public .
half of American citizens are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation as only about a third is satisfied .
&quot; the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem was brought to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversial wouldn &apos;t have effects on their common opinions from Clinton , although 36 percent said their opinion had deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views in Clinton become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them in registered voters . only 32 per cent see it as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the voting rights they do not hold for an honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote have a quite honest and un@@ tru@@ st@@ worthy , even tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , maintain good notes at the leadership . &quot;
&quot; out of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush will make it best in hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority does not look like frank@@ ly , but how with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 Sus@@ elec@@ tors by the presidential election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son reli@@ ed on a nationwide survey close behind Donald Tr@@ ump on
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the support of elec@@ tors in the new pol@@ l , and others fall dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republican elec@@ tors continue to actively support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the assistance is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the survey conducted from Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son shot up from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son sur@@ passed along with demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passed Tr@@ ump among Republican @-@ elec@@ tors with university education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio - Governor John Kas@@ ich , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who fell at least 2 % in the last month . &quot;
&quot; the former Governor of Florida , Je@@ b Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marc Ru@@ bio with 6 % on third place . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republican elec@@ tors in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son goes to the p@@ olls - he lands with 19 % support for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post showed even ump distinc@@ tly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view over the Rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found a number of page hi@@ kers for the former neuro@@ surgery , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ um@@ ps faith in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday in a campaign performance in Iowa . &quot;
pleasant beach temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is now up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even when the top values are measured in the distance , water @-@ ur@@ ers is enough to find a trip to the Mediterranean sea in order to warm up the warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather long treat at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; there is no more to the sea . a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea during this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) is shared . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , resort temperatures still offers Mediterranean Sea : in the east , it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; it is 25 degrees in the Adriatic , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees .
five members of the br@@ otherhood with the death of an Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student body at Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , a student union signed up in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood adopted Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a recording rit@@ ual when in September 2013 , and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; civil servants said he had been loaded with blin@@ ded eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack of sand , and was repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field on a target . &quot;
&quot; after all , Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained of heada@@ ches when she fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the call number 911 after Den@@ g had become power@@ less and waited an hour before they brought him into a hospital like the police .
&quot; but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothing , visit his symptoms of goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , the National President of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at that point , the members of the utensils had to hide and put the well @-@ being of the br@@ otherhood over the principle of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police boss Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning in his hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeated his head with tor@@ so force of injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student suffered since 1970 every year to the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , represents the D@@ eng@@ s family in a statement . &quot;
&quot; brothers and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe advised an indictment due to the third @-@ degree kill@@ ings for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with sus@@ pic@@ y attack and formation of a criminal organisation . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to make people responsible for those involved , but if there is an organization that has been san@@ ction officially or officially - this has been sanc@@ tion@@ ed , so we will also consider this to take account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
Bar@@ uch College had forbidden the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood re@@ vo@@ wed its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a interest rate hike has come , and the car@@ se becomes the sl@@ ender , rein@@ force the bonds , and the economy will slide into a recession . &quot;
we know that .
&quot; as long as we do not know , how long it will take and how long it will pause . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only small tut@@ orial to the process . &quot;
a recession came within 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when lifting interest rates is often , although not always , a factor here , as the economy and financial investments are respon@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; thus , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not concentrate on it when it begins to increase interest rates , rather , rather to the period , which is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , multiple variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants may consider that all the f@@ uss was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a rate of interest . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is becoming dis@@ gra@@ zing by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief economist at Capital Economics , in a communication of customers . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest on normal heights , but still on a low level to be led to the seis@@ mic shock that many seem to be afraid . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the capture of interest for women who are more vol@@ atile for a while . &quot;
&quot; once the increase is entered , the impact is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to get seas@@ oned by 12 to 24 months after the first raise , what perhaps again the delay in monetary policy reflect , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what is pec@@ uli@@ ar to interest in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market has mostly seen in the last 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest @-@ rate hike , fairly flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average operating margin in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average operating margin in Nu@@ ve@@ en asset management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares trend will occur later in the enh@@ ancing cycle and start to decrease the margin .
&quot; rec@@ essions , rec@@ essions are a fact of economic service but , for interest , promote them often . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed confron@@ ted with some conditions which could not exist before and could accelerate the recession . &quot;
&quot; it is highly remarkable , that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point at a rate of interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 Swiss francs was only twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only a few that this will run and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter . &quot;
&quot; orchest@@ ras in such a frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky and dis@@ card the question of whether this time is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
market participants have taken this year to an interest @-@ rate hike of the F@@ ed and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week that ends on Thursday .
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could do an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all enh@@ ancing cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a Super cycle with increasing the fluctu@@ ation of GDP . in fact , pre @-@ rec@@ essions have taken place very soon after the start of recovery in the shadow &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by contrast , this is a clear recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , whom the F@@ ed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; the solid income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , as the market takes a rate of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than shares if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to altern@@ ate the direction as soon as the first increase / lowering in the cycle is carried out .
&quot; at the end of the Incre@@ ase cycle , the bank loans are immediately falling , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; Charles Schw@@ ab convinced that the increase in interest rates will lead to closer relations between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a curve of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ yield bonds often bring better income in such a climate even though we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come c@@ yst@@ ine at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s interesting , Jones , that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; apart from the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to str@@ ingent monetary policy options . &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest have increased , while the qu@@ ir@@ on@@ curve is flat , loan ten@@ sion@@ ing and the increase has increased - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and whole , businesses that are un@@ spo@@ iled in the larger part of their business activities in the US are benef@@ iting from interest rates and make local products more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multin@@ ational corporations with high debts will be po@@ orer , as the number of dollars made their products more expensive in the global market and , as well , the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; share stocks are incl@@ ined to respond very positively , three months after an initial rate of interest , &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs ac@@ adem@@ ics said in a report for customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance , based on each of the interest income in 1994 , was sur@@ passed by 5 percentage points on average in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high investment rates and low vol@@ atility in their shares increased their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
&quot; company with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure stock , consumers are also benef@@ iting from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; as@@ ers might see gains through higher yields , even if experts in different opinion is how fast that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , states member of the Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
the Con@@ serv@@ atives as a member of the Parliament crit@@ ici@@ zed the broad@@ caster for his &quot; failure &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he could not differ increasingly from commercial rival .
he also has targeted at the BBC Music Awards and said they just lied with The Br@@ its
Chamber colleague Dam@@ ien Collins took the voice to The Voice to and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do what the private broad@@ caster cannot do . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ serv@@ atives of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ly &quot; and is not able to differ significantly from its competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dam@@ n &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also prepared at the BBC Music Awards , which started in December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so , if you try to do something else - these are two spont@@ aneously mentioned examples , in which you actually only edit that which is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
&quot; the BBC @-@ General pointed out the accus@@ ations , argu@@ ed that the BBC Radio 3 is on far off its commercial @-@ competitors , when it comes to the public about live music and education . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music somewhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that really is unbe@@ atable .
&quot; having to find out new music and doing new works on behalf of Radio 3 , I really keep things important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that tou@@ g@@ her needs to work to engage in the audience as it did in the past , because the British are less than classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that fell during the hearing in the committee on culture , media and sport for it under fire to kick the commercial vals on your feet . &quot;
T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins handle The Voice at - the musical talent Show at the BBC who bought from Dutch manufacturer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - will be produced by Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; on a special BBC way . &quot;
he added that he wants the company &quot; to find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; when it starts a entertainment series next time .

net sales grew in August at the slow@@ est market and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the start of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales strengthened three years ago through the use of cell phones
experts believe that Black Friday ma@@ stered the issue in November .
&quot; for over a decade , virtual shopping has arch@@ ed , and many of Britain &apos;s major shopping streets to Britain have turned into Gei@@ ster@@ Cities . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say there are indications that revenues are stag@@ n@@ ating after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; overall , the expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are indications that sales advance online sales after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , then over time has always been developed , &quot; says Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales complex . &quot;
&quot; he declared that the online sales began three years ago , as a purch@@ aser , began to make purchases in their cell purchases . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , such as at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this is a comm@@ uted , and we may have experienced that growth is reduced . &quot;
&quot; the Black Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for decl@@ ining revenues . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers will stop their purchases in front of this event , the last Friday of November last Friday . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers brings about their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some res@@ eller @-@ sites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , who stri@@ ve with the buyer for bar@@ gains , could stop selling the buyer . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 issues a little bit more than 1 £ online .
&quot; in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases must now be carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than one quarter of the people buy clothing and shoes online instead of fashion chains in the cities . &quot;
Muslims have been buried in Mec@@ ca by crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tion@@ ed
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead bodies , among the first bur@@ ial objects in Mec@@ ca by the streets &quot;
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group to the burden .
&quot; the Ministry of Health reported that , after all , 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed . &quot;
hundreds of Muslims were gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury them that were killed when a crane collapsed in the heat of Mec@@ ca .
&quot; crowded , widely filled and broad@@ ly dressed in white , the stretch to z@@ h@@ out their respect , when the first of the dead arrived their last voyage to the Al @-@ mo@@ h@@ is@@ m cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession passed by the Holy Sites , where only days earlier had a building crane by the ceiling of the mosque and then pl@@ ung@@ ed onto the pen@@ guin . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi King passed over the construction company Bin Laden because of the catastrophe which caused 3@@ 94 injured persons to a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 Bet@@ ers , who were killed when a crane collapsed by the Great Central Palace of Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets . &quot;
&quot; at the dead , Q@@ as@@ im was found in Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who had on his first pilgrimage , when the crane collapsed . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents at the beginning of the annual h@@ addle in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already confirmed that the h@@ addle ste@@ ers along the Mec@@ ca by thousands who continue to get to the city .
&quot; today King o@@ man said , the bin Laden Group had not been to have the arm of the crane , was not used as he was not used . &quot;
&quot; a Arabic version of the decree was published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden group is responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail , however , that the management of the company abroad must be prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man revealed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , who fell into a courtyard of the Groß@@ mos@@ rah , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were assembled in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which takes place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden Group has not published any statements about the collapse of the dragon , and their representatives were not on their opinion . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ mi@@ red the group because of not current security measures and because she did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes surround the Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ co as part of the massive construction being led by the Bin Laden group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected to the royal family of Saudi Arabia and has taken over greater construction projects .
&quot; the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a be@@ headed son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; the collapse of the crane came in the midst of a strong winds and rain , a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once a lifetime of each healthy car . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
&quot; according to government officials decre@@ ed that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed , and the same sum of permanent injuries . &quot;
other verses receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of the cheap East European crafts@@ man is over
&quot; Brit@@ ons employ an increasingly skilled worker , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled workers from eastern Europe has rise beyond

&quot; Ru@@ pert Steiner , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed to im@@ pose their h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favour of the use of qualified @-@ European tra@@ des@@ people who perform works in their home , &quot;

&quot; she said it was necessary to show@@ case the growing demo@@ graphic trends that feature more female @-@ households , more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to put this stronger to a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions about the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a big role in the decision process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also surrounded their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company , which has had over 50 percent of women with women , including his management and Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women to our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year income and par@@ agra@@ phs since the group had paid the costs for the closing of shops .
&quot; growing to King@@ fis@@ her , Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of a@@ ich / DO@@ B due to faith@@ less@@ ness in judgment
&quot; on Wednesday , the Regional Court of Kl@@ agen@@ furt took place on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian Volleyball runner , a@@ ich / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and sever@@ ance duties . &quot;
the accused were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was acquitted in May . &quot;
the present trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation was out , that the def@@ endants had been taught in the 2006 to 2011 schol@@ ars and were able to combine them in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage amounts to around 400,000 Euro . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged with financial records .
&quot; this factor was divided between the chair of the Sch@@ öff@@ ens@@ or , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; as a result of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence counsel , that , at no time , a wealth of wealth was formed . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials have missed only fees and the sports club for which it had been working from 1982 to 2011 and invested much time and money from the debt crisis - the passi@@ va was invested approximately 600,000 sh@@ illing ( approximately 4@@ 4,000 euros ) in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; at that time we stood before the situation : do we continue to conduct the club ? &quot; , &quot; one of the def@@ endants talked about the audit@@ or of the financial community . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have shot money , put our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; he said in gaining acceptance . &quot;
&quot; has been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money , no debts could be made . &quot;
&quot; moreover , at the appropriate financial success , the payout of the allowance is retro@@ spec@@ tively completed by 1991 . &quot;
&quot; as a result , a part of the accounts recei@@ vable only years later , namely , from 2003 , when an increase was paid in the account . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the l@@ ump and no detail bookings seemed , the former bre@@ ms@@ man explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings administered by the two def@@ endants , said the accused . &quot;
&quot; why the dis@@ bur@@ sement of the association was not analyzed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the club was not interested in detail for the financing itself , important thing is just the debt of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; when an investigation began in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euro was issued on the United States . &quot;
&quot; that had been resi@@ sted , said the def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; this value of securities ran on behalf of the second accused , and was not known according to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? , &quot; I wanted to know the judge . &quot;
on the contrary , the Be@@ en answered long no answer . &quot;
&quot; finally , he meant that he had believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something happened to him , nobody had known something of that money , the public prosecutor dropped into space . &quot;
fellow def@@ endants had been informed of inform@@ ati and just@@ i@@ fying .
this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; damages &quot; due .
&quot; why claims itu@@ tion ? , they wanted to know Judge and Public Prosecutor . &quot;
&quot; the first def@@ endant , said he was not able to agree with this formulation , because the association was never a defect . &quot;
&quot; but what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; All of you are all from the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a lawyer ? , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the function@@ ary said he has never covered a cent content , but it is calculated only o@@ dom@@ es and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; as a di@@ ets he asked to charge the association 1,000 euros per month , the actual effort was but much higher , added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years were not able to point the def@@ endants .
&quot; they asser@@ ted that they have been judged correctly after an operating audit@@ ing , in which all had been judged correctly and had no more requested . &quot;
kilometer tax also had included the second accused .
&quot; all home @-@ ments were in cash . for this purpose , he had to go to the Bank from his dwelling place to the Bank to Blei@@ k , he explained in his asser@@ tion . &quot;
the main hearing was continued with the survey of witnesses on 23 September .

&quot; as a result , a total cost of $ 2.7 billion is to be saved ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company distributed on Tuesday . &quot;
the step will lead to a special exposure of approximately $ 2.7 billion which will drop in the fourth quarter .
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs has not been completed since the past three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP did some 30@@ 2,000 associates at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence of Serbian and Hungarian border
the Hungarian police has deployed at the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and head@@ lamps against several hundred exquisite refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ The correspon@@ dent D@@ án@@ iel Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the decline in the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees cra@@ cked the border .
behind it a polic@@ eman joined the head@@ lamps and placed behind the police officer .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began with stones , sto@@ cks and plastic bottles to the civil servants . &quot;

after that the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of Tr@@ än@@ gs was spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .

time of decision on interest rates for the US emergency database
&quot; the world is watching when the U.S. not@@ ches come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether or for the first time since almost a decade the interest will be raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reuters , found that a bit more than half the fact that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer , and the interest rates remain at this current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historic event , because it has been seven years ago since the F@@ ed has earned interest on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank possibly reli@@ es the zero range and a process of norm@@ alisation on interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ pt@@ . , leader of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good performance level , trillion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation . &quot;
however the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ pes outlook on global relationships .
&quot; you have warned the markets to halt on an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday .
death @-@ protecting at Delta State University leave ra@@ ologi@@ zing
&quot; after the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he f@@ lowed further on his counter@@ f@@ ties , Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say that he &apos;s &quot; sorry &quot; for the first murder and wanted to do it , &quot; &quot; he could not make it un@@ seen &quot; , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said &quot; Lamb , lecturer for geography and social scientific education at Delta State University , calling for emergency number for 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , I shot someone and killed him . &quot;
&quot; Lamb said to the staff of the emergency call , which police had to send police officers to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I f@@ lowed my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; was in the house but &quot; nobody else will inter@@ fere , &quot; but probably will be more excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the sur@@ fer after his name , but he didn &apos;t give him . &quot;
lamb had no explanation for his legs .
&quot; lamb had entered the scene as a police , they found the body by Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry to do , I might sort it back . &quot;
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; following a letter of notice , lamb earned 300 miles to Delta State University , where he made E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police officers push him . &quot;
&quot; however , University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he had nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs demonstrate . &quot;
&quot; in spite of reports on Monday , the Lamb is believed to have a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday to give &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; three persons relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ ent@@ ree was described by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married seven years later than a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were left 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Bo@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ ep@@ le would have been a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed at the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ ote had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pre@@ ent@@ iss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , that was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss . &quot;
&quot; Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ le , who possessed a dog named Light@@ ning , emerged as a lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; Kno@@ w@@ les said &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lamb didn &apos;t called to call on a certain point on Monday , to say , &quot; he will not go into prison . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when police found him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , Lamb left his car to the side , fled on foot , hur@@ ried into the woods and killing themselves with a shot . &quot;
&quot; lamb received a Ph.@@ D. in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University , which speci@@ alizes in the University &apos;s website . &quot;

Euro wings : Lufthansa grows the Group
Lufthansa is planning a big corporate restructuring .
&quot; in 2005 , the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros one year alone with a better organization . &quot;
&quot; 150 of the world &apos;s approximately 1,000 managers worldwide will cost the workplace . &quot;
there are no new negotiations with the pilot work .
the Lufthansa organis@@ es its business structure and evalu@@ ates the Euro wings of cheap Euro wings .
&quot; the new positioning will be worth € 500 million per year for cost and revenue sy@@ ner@@ gies , the airline divided on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Lufthansa does not provide any more on the passenger shop in the Lufthansa . &quot;
the Euro@@ s@@ wings will set to be developed as a stand @-@ alone as possible .
&quot; in the board team led by CEO Carsten Spo@@ hr will soon be responsible for Euro@@ s@@ wings , in future . &quot;
the re @-@ positioning is under@@ lined the importance of euro@@ s@@ wings with which the Group wants to fight against Ry@@ an@@ air and easy@@ jet .
&quot; so far , the organisation of the 120 &quot; 000 employees experienced a strong company . &quot;
&quot; under the roof of the passage Air@@ line Group , the airline design@@ ates three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; the negotiations with the pilot German cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations on the court line should be resum@@ ed on this Thursday . &quot;
this divided the union with .
issue of talks shall be the resting place for pilots .
&quot; in a year , the cockpit was &quot; fast possible with a projected re@@ record &quot; result . &quot;
the conflict between the union and Air@@ line led to various strikes in the last few months .
&quot; in the background , beside the trans@@ itional provision of the drivers , the &quot; Spar@@ c concept &quot; Wings is fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; it seems that Lufthansa will hold s@@ wings on the Group &apos;s own cheap approval line , in order to compete against competitive routes . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United can &apos;t play for two months
Luke Sha@@ w suffered with the Champions @-@ League @-@ defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven a double fre@@ ak of his right foot .
&quot; while this is to the left , the left for wine has brought to wine and exclu@@ de it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Sha@@ w cannot compete again in this season . &quot;
injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken in the PS@@ V region .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg fra@@ cture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be re@@ located tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then performed in Manchester .
&quot; terrible - a boy that comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then fantastic doesn &apos;t play , and then it happens . &quot;
in the disgu@@ sting cabin it had a oxygen @-@ mask .
he wept .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double tin@@ cture , it will take six months and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red Card and a river &apos;s passing away .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al believes the Italian arbit@@ rators had er@@ red in any way .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that a penalty of up and a red card is due . &quot;
it was a very worst attack with both legs .
&quot; a T@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ ws account comments : &quot; thank you all for your news . words can &apos;t describe how kap@@ i am , my path to recovery starts now , I &apos;m getting stronger again . &quot;
here in Manchester : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat at PS@@ V
England &apos;s def@@ ender has added an additional inc@@ entive for the European Championship in France until the coming June .
&quot; Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V trainer , said : &quot; it is a very aw@@ ful injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves behind this type of violation , all are very sad . &quot;
it is never the purpose of our players to hurt another opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as the Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear that there is a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was not possible to see the moment . &quot;
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; talking to S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how things feel , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel really bad . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a matter to learn all parents soon : if your child loves a book it will not last long before you know it almost .
&quot; unless you are , you are perhaps David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; having been asked by a provider of child care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book was chosen , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to give my children , because it seems to always have a picture or a message that we have previously missed . &quot;
&quot; everything was fine and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead of re @-@ added a content of the 2012 video version , added the new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ose @-@ Ville , where all the nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ drey , the girl of his dreams he was carried . &quot; &quot; a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Bar@@ uss ho@@ stage , and he died in 1991 . &quot;
&quot; as if that was not susp@@ icious enough : the text provided by Cameron is partly looked like the summary of the City Movie Database , where everything is artificial , and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ drey to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; even though he ad@@ mits to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is considered to be so little familiar with the local environment through the gel@@ ding , trees @-@ l@@ apping , thro@@ po@@ uring two beings , &quot; which says in the name of the trees , &quot; is to be devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR role was deleg@@ ated to a helper that The Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times in a child . &quot;
a Do@@ wning Street person said the text probably came from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s electoral office .
&quot; the super@@ camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ s employees , but there were no further det@@ ain@@ able comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; getting to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if you have selected the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , a recovery of the 3 @-@ 0 test runs does not appear on my map . &quot;
I would not close an out@@ ward victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in Batt@@ ing order , and the joint spirit is strong ; they will carry no scar@@ ring from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive setting . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ player and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on a test plane , it is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; in this news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving from the England test Ka@@ der , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course , for me , as Head of Music in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests there were two good attacks in difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality that crime players are oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nomin@@ ation , there - and I told this - players to choose their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , she would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if hopefully move further runs to Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot;
&quot; the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss glorified his attitude , even if he did not get such good achievements , and that surprised me not ; he is especially a team guy . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time a test banner wins , in order to put his character is difficult . &quot;
&quot; Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son , for Nick Com@@ pt@@ on nine . &quot;
only Com@@ pt@@ on received the chance for home and out@@ ward expansion .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation which can be carried out was that England gave first Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean , but this lost probability is now in the past . &quot;
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a b@@ ats@@ man whom I op@@ pres@@ sive .
he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ ker that we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he recorded 236 for uns on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Road making us very much .
&quot; he must , at least the same chances as those who were before him , but this depends on the team &apos;s team agreement in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Cook , the idea of being hit Cook , which would get a extra Spin @-@ spin and got four ch@@ icks , appeared , and I did not do anything about it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man can &apos;t strike there , and these left @-@ handed grounds have already shown that he is a devil &apos;s simulator of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Mo@@ een couldn &apos;t do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is no number 3 for them , and there is no difference . &quot;
&quot; my former team @-@ mate Justin Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests on the first drop , before he joined the Op@@ ener in 2001 . &quot;
he immediately abolished and looked back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari enters the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited company he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people probably see his statistics on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 by the ball - and think , it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spins , raising their hands and the coach have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has taken a few smart additions to the train@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ a , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the trial games could be a masterpiece . &quot;
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game who will bring a wealth of experience since it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes into the white sphere of action and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
&quot; I was always felt that he was created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , when player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insight , of which we can profit . &quot;
sometimes new voices can bring fresh winds in the dressing cabin even if the messages are in line with what can be said .
&quot; Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used in the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and me for my part I have no problem with that . &quot;
some will not agree but co@@ aches and team perform@@ ers do not define the schedule .
and you need to remember that as in players their jobs will depend on results .
such decisions are not taken to a light heart .

&quot; my European friend , who wants to be looking out outside the EU @-@ tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and can be seen that more and more short @-@ c@@ auti@@ ous ministers and officials came in several major cities to the point where they don &apos;t matter or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s auti@@ ous ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a ally independent , but she has been in power for 10 years before doing it bad for her , as it did for the exagger@@ ating long har@@ r@@ ents like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and cab@@ bage ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande can look on his re @-@ election or his resignation in 2017 .
he is also an ass@@ blo@@ ating strength .
&quot; Poland may soon become a nation@@ alistic @-@ righ@@ tist government , one left one le@@ ft@@ ist in Spain . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to imagine that a leg will be rup@@ turing in order to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better than to prevent from Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK , because the most similar separat@@ ist ten@@ dencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers perhaps even deliberately not planning some ann@@ ot@@ ations , quite in SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s report campaign to speed up the Bre@@ xit , a friend susp@@ ects my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was an Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of its ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics were the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ one since it did not agree on our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; they can remember the weak start of Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who did a name as a &quot; EU @-@ odd @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; foreign correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ ies . &quot;
&quot; in all his absence , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Med@@ ley of Tax@@ es and P@@ seu@@ do @-@ advoc@@ ating foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners who own most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Tony Bl@@ air was thinking like her , but he realized that if you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you can split better ban@@ anas at home , instead of becoming a lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more than Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air himself when he was opposed to himself on the referendum , because Bl@@ air had turned the principle on the non @-@ approved Constitution of the EU which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters that opened it in 2005 . &quot;
the press never promised him .
&quot; but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ l who gave me a friendly little water on the back of Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no time left for myself - seems to repeat the boy@@ cott of Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take that but he needs to develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa was left on Sunday . &quot;
&quot; Cor@@ by@@ ns official position on Europe , - I press it friendly - in development . &quot;
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p are traditional sub@@ sid@@ y @-@ tendency and the fur@@ ious acts of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; an Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on Radio and on TV this week , when the sc@@ outs of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell had a bad idea to provoke the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as shadow att@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; it remin@@ ded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father engaged in television , loyal to his British cabinet re @-@ cabinet , without losing too far and his cabinet re @-@ job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , was not what J@@ C told his collabor@@ ators and M@@ EPs on Monday evening on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching Bot@@ tom @-@ Up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to mediate , remember that it even stir@@ red me - News . discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and particularly in the stru@@ del of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no open ticket to Europe who allowed him to keep lab@@ ours in the speech campaign for a matter of course , like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins doesn &apos;t think so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental pl@@ am@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite ins@@ ult economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past , is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussing on the left dis@@ sidents of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes . &quot;
&quot; as with its multi @-@ purpose activities for Nato - Tom Watson is rocky that J@@ C will not start a campaign at the outlet , so foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin would waste political capital - they have also mis@@ erable choice - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed of the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government at the power of which I was remembered at the start of Monday , what was called British Influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK about e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims to a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful as smoking caused by a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et opened to the Lanc@@ et by the fact that they critic@@ ise the use of Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report about e @-@ cigarettes . &quot;
P@@ he published the &quot; basic version &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have asked the stability of the data and rel@@ ates to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ ate foundation &quot; that the P@@ he set up his major conclusion .
there are two other researchers in BM@@ J and asked whether the &quot; spec@@ ulations &quot; are set up on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of Public Fir@@ m Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies based on efficacy is based . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public prosecutor &apos;s claim that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful to Smo@@ king &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people who were invited to develop a model for multiple criteria ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to bring their opinions on the damage of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ hal@@ es products to produce synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received from British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to under@@ go health in a sustainability report .
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that they will receive funding from a E @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not funding , which he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee will not be delivered , but these include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes champion , some of which also provide industry funding in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the general meeting of P@@ he was also involved in the session .
&quot; research work of the Group &quot; quali@@ fies that there is a lack of &quot; for@@ gery for most of the products in most criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot;
however no such connections or restrictions mentioned in the e @-@ report will be discussed .
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that we have no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes have been as a way for smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said , said that BM@@ J has responded to the alleg@@ ations . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are significantly less harmful as smoking . &quot;
&quot; every second li@@ fel@@ ong smoking dies , in his ad@@ diction . &quot;
&quot; any evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are small compared with the fact , but that we still have to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ he has the unique commitment to the public about what is proof and what is not , especially if there is much public confusion about the relative dangers of the tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80,000 people die yearly in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the national healthcare system £ 2 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; by clear statements of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking will carry out our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give to East@@ En@@ ders , former CEO of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC will stop writing programs like the East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival &quot; would give her right arm &quot; for sm@@ ash shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that can not be sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he crit@@ ici@@ zed the BBC , that they will be seen public law programs that probably can be seen from a smaller audience , in hard disputed time@@ frames against the most popular shows of their rival and from broadcasting such as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Cliff , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations I said Johnson had tried for six years in his time to Channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that the BBC commissioned programs in order or sends them out , which also clearly are un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus communications committee as part of its investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I hold medium or long term is not for a good idea , one should keep his production at least on programs that do not make or commissioned . &quot;
they send the Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a wide support of their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody would demonstrate this is a joke , it &apos;s ridic@@ ulous , it is non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a rainy tax is financed and it can also be financed without the subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both property productions . &quot;
hon@@ estly others would give other channels on their right arm .
try to see how this public @-@ broad@@ ly television is meant to be on the public .
I don &apos;t think this would be able to decrease the BBC .
&quot; Johnson , a entrepreneurs for series who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is on the hunt for reviews , because of the amb@@ itions of the people working there and because they believe that this is the best way to support long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will give again what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather publicly @-@ institutional @-@ programs &quot; can go to BB@@ C4 , but they can &apos;t compete at the public , but they can use their tasks , and they can argue they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ents for just@@ ification of 4 billion pounds , of course , we have seen all these ob@@ sc@@ ents programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in an time@@ out where nobody ever wanted to see them .
&quot; at the radio station , Johnson said the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather rainy weather in terms of conditions to get the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course , you &apos;ll all think that one receives a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who &apos;s a lot of money for the 150 £ , wonder if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also told the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check that the BBC should check out its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little from BBC @-@ production would now officially be classified as an education , and he said that it should be 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % in radio - and they should take care of this in public @-@ legal TV channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC will do much more in areas like the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will go on and with the commercial Sen@@ ders Alli@@ ances , in order to make all online available . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can ste@@ er brain cells by sound waves
&quot; the video shows how the viruses may alter the direction in the moment , in which it is ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound imp@@ ul@@ ses . &quot;
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified organisms that can be controlled by br@@ ittle of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment on which they have sound imp@@ ul@@ ses , which have higher frequencies for the human hearing to be heard . &quot;
&quot; the imp@@ ul@@ ses work by switching from Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on @-@ cells that are genetically modified to bear the membrane channels , react to ultr@@ asound . &quot;
another on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , in which ultr@@ asound can be used to enable a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure one day could replace the depths of cran@@ ial processes , inv@@ asive methods , electrical imp@@ ul@@ ses into the brain of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; mer@@ cil@@ men usually don &apos;t react to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ m@@ ani noted that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ opic particles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , intensi@@ fy the ultr@@ asound ks@@ ha@@ fts , which then penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the reinforced ultr@@ asonic shafts works on structures , called TR@@ P @-@ 4 I@@ onic channels and can be found in membran@@ es of some of the worms . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves are the opening of these I@@ onic channels , and activate the cells that they are assigned , so a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultr@@ as@@ ion@@ ised Nem@@ ato@@ des , Cal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that carry out some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ship TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ onic channels . &quot;
&quot; if ultr@@ asound is turned onto the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bub@@ bles and transferred into the worms , where they switch the changed mot@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch neur@@ ons with imp@@ ul@@ ses of light and turn off . &quot;
&quot; but Hal@@ as@@ ani said , that Son@@ ogen@@ etics could have some advantages over this technique . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to light , that needs to be reduced to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic sensors may suffer un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent into the brain above the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that having therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible , the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily pr@@ one to the ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Lam@@ as@@ ani . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student halls
&quot; eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence at the age of 19 , but still on belief in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vism , but only remember I remember the ten@@ acious sm@@ iles of those who I have been angry - and to the numerous , sli@@ my complaints about others . &quot;
&quot; most of the I &apos;ve learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules . &quot;
the move in student halls reaches by slightly ner@@ able up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to talk : people tell whence you get where and where you have taken a Sabbath year , where you are turning to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you say &quot; hon@@ estly , Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love still hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it is just a yeast extract , ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
help others to do the same - ask issues and show interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like , contrary to those with which you would not speak , even if your l@@ ashes were burned in fire and this fire extingu@@ ishers will be . &quot;
let people leave .
&quot; people often transform themselves into beverage recipes , film night events and communal hits , but they are also the places where people dress up and their under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; in relation to this , do not think about getting along with a relationship with a relationship . &quot;
Intro@@ duc@@ ted Intro@@ duc@@ ing a large treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residence form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ space @-@ culture that can lead to life and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; nothing to say to you : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship on , but you go away to get back the energy , which I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a recru@@ its of soci@@ alizing is exhausted , and send him an SMS instead . &quot;
cli@@ pos : do it : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the not@@ ion that an in@@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw a few things .
Friend@@ ship close by baking .
&quot; as you start the Uni , at the height of the back @-@ mania , the clo@@ ds at the doors of people begin to imagine with a plate filled with brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange as the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something you fried . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a great way to close friend@@ ships .
their ro@@ omm@@ ates are engaged to enter@@ tain yourself and become at the end of perhaps your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , it depends on whether you are a decent bak@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; po@@ or@@ ly mixed lot of flour , sugar and fat make it sleeping when you anchor them sleeping . &quot;
steal food is a common crime in student residence .
&quot; of course , is the ho@@ of of chicken a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea ? &quot;
check it with the original owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to operate themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to go well balanced as my fellow @-@ resident who added to their milk a deter@@ sive agent to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves . &quot;
she is now in jail .
&quot; you should not do noise , people from sleep , or from work . &quot;
&quot; not just about being a decent human being , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b belongs to people , sitting in gl@@ ass@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my corridor asked their neighbours , whether they are doing something , Drum &amp; Bass slightly qui@@ eter , because at three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning . &quot;
they acted on it even l@@ ur@@ istic music .
&quot; finally , when they stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , her neighbours were kindly to sleep for two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and set off on her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse should go into the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other way , it would not be ignor@@ ant if you have a representative living partner for your future married partner to join them again and they will need to see each day and then see how they with@@ draws together all their shared friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart is his own way - but if a hot co @-@ keeper is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to talk a little reason . &quot;
&quot; the most exciting moment in which you notice that someone has its keys in its un@@ locked room , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing f@@ one when it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good route is fun , but it takes just moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; share a valuable and am@@ using lesson over security , but never th@@ a@@ wed someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo . &quot;
&quot; complete your door , and place its keys in a glass of water , which you then place in the freezer , but t@@ acked their possessions at the ceiling not more than twice . &quot;

&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees are in a housing room , but as well as the m@@ ating mother and the polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; I show how one can still build and build well today , &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing onto the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Mark Gil@@ dner believes in how quickly the affordable housing can be created : it builds for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , lots of refugees are pushing onto the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
mark Gil@@ dner : living in containers or gy@@ ms have no sustainability .
because the people stay at a great part here .
&quot; given the refugee flow , we also need enough space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a whole ban@@ quet , dirty terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a town house needs the fe@@ west .
it facil@@ it@@ ates integration .
that &apos;s different when people put people in blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are just being built in the pilot project , consists of three main units for each of four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each living unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees are going to say , it &apos;s peace , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can be re@@ mod@@ elled easily to their needs . &quot;
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : price for 160 square meter space per house amounts to EUR 184 000 , without land . &quot;
that is man@@ age@@ able .
six months took the construction .
that is reasonable .
do the construction legislation have made their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : in general I went through my project .
&quot; particularly complicated , it always makes the imp@@ ending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ worth special construction and the plac@@ ental . &quot;
&quot; bone , pri@@ med . &quot;
&quot; it is still sub@@ ordin@@ ated , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities the square is missing .
refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the indigenous people react to their terra@@ ced house ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : there was one who was accused of making luxury for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
which definitely not right .
but don &apos;t you tigh@@ ten the compet@@ itor campaign to pay paid apartments ?
&quot; it &apos;s true : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but we built luxury apartments that can hardly afford to afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the m@@ ating mother or the inter@@ mitt@@ ent operator . &quot;
show how one still can build and build well today .
that is why it goes .

&quot; furthermore , Sam@@ i &apos;s mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promoted U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and Az@@ endor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Cab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; there are many places in many places on the country , whereas doctors said : Dr. Frank Müller is taking on a practice in practice on 1 October . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel is retired into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing in its successor at half a spot in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then it was invested 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at the St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy for the first sight , when the Fel@@ ipe was getting to know Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who is currently completing her practice in the hospital and will also enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the garbage bags would fit into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel rock breaks and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was ready , I simply called them . &quot;
the couple Müller was the idea of organizing their own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patient are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families about the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also see his own boss . &quot;
and so we were cat@@ chy that the garbage bags made the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; he also grew up the double @-@ time family of Frank Müller , followed by his medical Studies in Hannover , followed by medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ â@@ tel . &quot;

we will provide more ultr@@ asound tests as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ performance EK@@ GS and need a sound @-@ room more .

&quot; as part of a funding programme from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as the congregation ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) , we receive a grant of € 50@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy are we , that the practice is passed , &quot; emphas@@ izes Sam@@ mann &apos;s citizenship , Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
approximately 2000 patients with Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l each quarter are coming to practice Fel@@ low breaks in the North German practice there are about 500 .
there are another general practition@@ er in As@@ endorf .
a positive side effect of prag@@ matic arrest by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains at the Ur@@ sel rim in As@@ endorf .
&quot; if no successor had been found , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; if you visit the garbage bags , it also still looks in familiar faces : the seven medical specialists and the cleaning force takes over by the rock . &quot;
&quot; with their departure at As@@ endorf is an era , after all , the medical profession had been practic@@ ed for 30 years . &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; now the border checks are raised also at our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; in parallel , controls on the Hungarian border are to be held in parallel . &quot;
&quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to give an application for asylum , can also of course be &quot; of course . &quot; &quot;
the supply and security of people stand in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that there is considerable signals , &quot; the Minister said . &quot;
people must not know that we don &apos;t accept infinite migration flows neither of Austria &apos;s Austr@@ o @-@ Slov@@ ene border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering the &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia
&quot; the Croatian government had previously told that Slovenia would continue travelling to refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and need to set cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; all this was the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ y Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors was &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia become rather monitoring the fron@@ tier - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
the border with Croatia may be as strong as the upper limit of the Schengen area .
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians wants to inter@@ lock his borders for refugees however . &quot;
&quot; every EU member needs to fill his comm@@ itments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s. Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried during the night hours to Tuesday to pass in Ost@@ ro@@ a at the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d border crossing for registration . &quot;
the Croatian police put them up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police cars ever meet new and new refugees . &quot;
&quot; some of them are joined by Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children . &quot;
even rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; over the coming days , his country began with around 4000 refugees , said Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bus@@ es from Pre@@ se@@ vo to the Maced@@ onian Serbian border , which previously carried out migrants to the Hungarian border , dis@@ agreed Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , cont@@ ested that they might be willing to sm@@ ite certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; in any case , according to media reports , a first bus had arrived in the morning with about 50 refugees in the Serbian fron@@ tier town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day some buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria &quot;
&quot; the occup@@ ants were traveling the entire night from the Maced@@ onian border through Serbia around 500 km away . &quot;
&quot; we heard that Hungary has agreed , so the police said that we should come here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
this means that it might actually happen to the observer of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia in Hungary to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Minister of Interior , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , had previously st@@ resses that his country for the case of a strong state of refugees had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situation . &quot;
he didn &apos;t tell details but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen group offers comprehensive possibilities for border control .
one increases strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen Area .
&quot; Slovenia has joined this country since 2007 . since then , the EU partners have since gone through a good report about what concerns the standard controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , there are still some 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , they had spent past night at the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to Hungarian authorities the two border check@@ points Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining fug@@ iti@@ ves still want to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Interior Minister Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic tried to calm on Wednesday at a local instant in Hor@@ g@@ os : he hold the debates at the alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it currently wouldn &apos;t act to be a very high number of refugees .
&quot; can &apos;t be said if they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
helper responded to migrants - Are@@ as - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have begun to distribute the refugees maps , where alternative routes are drawn through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous . there are even 20 years after the end of the conflict there is still no longer min@@ ef@@ ields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police acknowledged that a team of min@@ ef@@ ields was sent to the border region . &quot;

&quot; thus , a total of more than 100 million dollars was endo@@ wed in this manner . &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter and the rec@@ fer @-@ giant showed his winning sight on a whole year due to the weak@@ est demand for freight service and higher costs in his boat transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire a 5@@ 5.000 season of seasonal workers for the holiday .
&quot; last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period . &quot;
the share fell to over 2.5 per cent in the pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in fiscal year , ending 20 cents less than in previous forecast . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; the lower view is increased in spite of the price increases , which are an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective on January 4 and despite the higher impacts on soil transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it would still expect that the result compared to the previous year , to increase cost reduction , higher income , and growth of growth in online commerce . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the &quot; solid income &quot; will take into consideration as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for vac@@ ations were announced a day later than that of the rival UPS , that plans to set 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex was $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , representing the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;

six of Z@@ acks made an anticipated $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced a decline in the international depar@@ ment disp@@ atch , which made sales in his unit Express Shipping . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results of F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; sales increased by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was flat almost due to a higher cost of larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while earnings for higher labor costs decreased . &quot;
&quot; in the pre @-@ market trading , an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ shares increased by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;

&quot; this third mandate is the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too narrow to predic@@ t it . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is start@@ led , by un@@ parall@@ eled cat@@ ching due to the near @-@ current short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that they grow solid , the latest turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets have already anxi@@ ous to rein@@ force these vol@@ atility through the lifting of the Zin@@ c for federal government - and be it only about a quarter of per@@ cent@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; apparently , the labour market and inflation would be the most important to observe what they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , leader of the making of Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , increased safety is around the global market enough just@@ ification , continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed is going to do in itself the financial market .
&quot; about half of econom@@ ists , who were recently interviewed by Bloomberg , said a rate hike this week . &quot;
&quot; financial markets , however , await a wait in the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows just a 30 % chance for an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a drop in the share market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ist states that the strateg@@ ist states that they promise that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial pattern aver@@ aged 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; action was raised by expectations that the F@@ ed policy kept the sentence during this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief economist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would take sentences to that point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you do it , it would have to go very far in its declaration to calm the financial markets so that they do not get into panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argu@@ ed that a rate of interest rate would calm the financial markets , because it would bar@@ red the un@@ certainty on when the F@@ ed is acting . &quot;
&quot; even before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the movement by 0.@@ 25 percentage points per month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ ter of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; in the spring and early summer , Y@@ ella had said that it would expect more economic progress in this year despite the compl@@ aining of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be expected to increase the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed , the improvement in the job market was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and in the level of levels that sees the F@@ ed as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown evidence of recovery .
&quot; although inflation settled under the central bank of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and therefore demand it because of tension in the Labour Market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ dson , Chief economist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets in the world had ended at the end of the last month , after China had given its currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial Average worth over 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would face global growth . &quot;
&quot; this month , the market has recovered something that the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the Ho@@ ch of May . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influence the complex calculation , when you should raise interest . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have occurred in the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low on the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of US emergency database . &quot;
&quot; now he predic@@ t that it will wait at least one month , in order to get the impact better into the grip . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty on what the effects on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; O@@ ers said . &quot;
&quot; world economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , therefore , they should not be related to their decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in end the F@@ ed Monetary Union has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous throughout the years .
&quot; the naked hint by the then Leit@@ ner , Ben S. Bern@@ anke , in 2013 that the F@@ ed could release its monetary expansion . &quot; &quot; confusion clearance around the world . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined by the F@@ ed representative , they can not only monitor the developments in other locations , but also discuss with other central banks and experts , in order to achieve a better understanding for the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for the Management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has linked a story of inter@@ actions on finance market movements , which seem to be associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , voting for a rate of interest of the Federal Open Market Committee , cited for a rate of interest , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their duc@@ ts by 0,@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions . &quot; in spite of re@@ perc@@ ei@@ vable impact on growth in the US , &quot; L@@ acker said . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representative made these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis as the market crash in 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England . &quot;
the most recent turbul@@ ence are not coming near this level .
&quot; it certainly doesn &apos;t want to be in the situation where it &apos;s afraid of interest @-@ rate hike , because the markets felt exciting , &quot; &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think it should take time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : young refugees for refugees
more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
&quot; to prepare a warm welcome , we are not concerned without the dedication of our volunteer hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there is a number of people who support un@@ reasonable asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
&quot; Petra H@@ eine is a teacher , with her body and soul teacher . &quot;
she has also tou@@ red her 74 countries and is still teaching .
every Thursday she is acting in the asylum seek@@ ers at D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is quite different classes than at a right school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s Pe@@ er@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande promote food heal@@ th@@ ier nutrition
the Brazilian @-@ based organisation SP@@ RS tried to clarify in a sho@@ cking manner for women to clarify how important good nutrition is during the breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give the babies every nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are going to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake was not the only dietary adaptation that has the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can influence the immune system negative . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ard@@ g@@ sports hall
&quot; the Municipal Council , Bern@@ ried , approved the building licence for the 2.3 million euro by expensive sports hall . &quot;
and he made an exception .
the roof may become fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ desired gy@@ ms ram@@ fully at the Bern@@ ard@@ der sports grounds are step by step forward : in the latest way of priv@@ ati@@ zation the designed construction application has been obvious without large discussions .
&quot; before that , the commission had previously decided to publish an application to a legal &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid construction plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; exception &quot; there was permission to build a special form in the roof structure . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; s@@ wind@@ shield with non @-@ profit first and roof super@@ structure &quot; is to be built . &quot;
&quot; background the planned usage of the roof area for solar installations : &quot; thereby we get a wonderfully large southern roof together , &quot; Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger said in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Liberation , &quot; turn again around the ti@@ lt that is prescribed for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
&quot; in this capacity , the volume of the hall is significantly reduced . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; is therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof is no &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ard@@ der Group is generally quite restri@@ ctive in the application of liberation . &quot;
&quot; in the gy@@ ms @-@ construction , however , this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent &quot; as St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gy@@ ro@@ ber@@ nation at sports centre is a community project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; in total , around 2.3 million euros are imp@@ aired . &quot;
grants are expected from school and cutting transport .
&quot; in the next step of process , construction application for the 18 x 36 metre hall is now presented to the country code with the inspection . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of employees move by P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the district parliament had a look at the or@@ it@@ ress Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
&quot; however , the Supervisory Board does a decision to meet the Supervisory Board and the t@@ us@@ al meeting on Wednesday 23 September . &quot;
&quot; the plans should be implemented , and all of the nearly 50 employees would continue working at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the overwhelming majority of fishermen and the further exist@@ ent internal station after Sh@@ ong@@ au move .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees who are unable to work with Sch@@ ong@@ au , is to be offered a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the delay has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only the general manager of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year , and now changes to a private practice in immediate proximity of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question of those who want to succeed , came to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came to the game who declared themselves ready to take over the leadership as of 1 October , and to move with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au it means that in any case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the field of Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
S@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inner station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; as a result of the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to the next year , the former hospital of the pop@@ e which has yet more than 35 beds in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far the County had planned this for 2018 , when the current running reconstruction finished in the hospital W@@ eil@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; J@@ och@@ mann @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , went to meet what is the house that is owned by the Federal Council in future , in the future for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m closing out . &quot; how it goes on to the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several refle@@ ctions . &quot;
&quot; currently , a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a phase @-@ psychological att@@ ain@@ ee are housed there . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity is not coming again , &quot; says Fischer over the Qu@@ asi re@@ location on Le@@ ch , who was impressed by the staff &quot; positively and very understand@@ able . &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as a che@@ wing for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to accept the post of the medical director .
&quot; the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) had been threatened with closure , departments have been closed in recent decades , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;

&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was announced on Sunday morning , after she had not arrived at home on Sunday after a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ av@@ ausen . &quot;

refugees take accommodations : study warns of residential buildings
the situation in the German residential property is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees seek a paid stay .
the pressure on the residential market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution of the German residential property has recently begun .
with the adv@@ ent refugees and job @-@ seek@@ ers from the EU more people push for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many major cities .
they compete with income citizens in order to receive the last affordable dwell@@ ings .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be built up by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; in this result , a study on behalf of the &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; was commissioned . &quot;
&quot; to compare , 260@@ ,000 units will be finished in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; in this way , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
refugees are not oblig@@ ated to live in the first three months of their stay as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial shelter .
many c@@ utt@@ les onto the housing market and rows in the long sn@@ akes before the apartments .
&quot; according to statistics from the Federal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were used to rent . &quot;
the negative development of residential development is not just in the rising refugee market .
this study also makes significant decline in residential building policy in recent years .
Germany shooting a residential property in front of itself which will get bigger from year to year .
&quot; the urban area currently has some 77@@ ,000 housing units , including Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; many experienced professionals stayed in large cities in WG @-@ rooms , there@@ from . &quot;
young adults stayed in the home market no longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square metres per capita has dropped for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; social housing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; thereby , new inc@@ enti@@ ves are to stim@@ ulate the social housing . &quot;
that could be wai@@ ved on the real estate tax and the basic tax on subsidi@@ zed dwell@@ ings are carried out .
&quot; in addition , the alliance has provided attractive fiscal @-@ like scenarios . &quot;
the feed program for refugee shel@@ ters in the state bank of Kf@@ W now works well in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start was launched on Monday evening by 184 million euros , more than half of the available currently available at 300 million euros . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia in the corridor
&quot; practically no passes will come to Hungary , so more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in Zagreb , Croatia &apos;s announ@@ cing the transit across Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les . &quot;
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate to the neighboring countries of Slovenia over the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Slovenian interior minister when it is necessary , we are organized a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already a Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen area .
&quot; after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees escap@@ es to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have entered the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the German TV RTL radio . &quot;
Hungary had blocked his limit for refugees .
new laws which came into force on the same day will practically unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic said : &quot; you can pass through and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and those who want to live and want to achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , people do not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police had taken place in the morning of Serbia &apos;s first refugees to the EU neighbouring country in Croatia .
&quot; most of the media came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxi in the Serbian boundary town of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get on foot over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees are unable to get to the f@@ ences .
the hunt for the border crossing other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ ef@@ ields will now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; according to Hungary , no more refugees arrive after closing the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police had ri@@ ppl@@ ed 3@@ 66 . &quot;
&quot; just before the end of the trial on Monday , it was 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws classi@@ fies over@@ coming and damage to the border cal@@ am@@ us than crime .
in the South Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed up 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
&quot; the prison sentences , sentences of up to five years and the deportation from the country . &quot;
&quot; according to the immigration authorities , one went on Tuesday in the newly designated &quot; &quot; Tran@@ se@@ ons &quot; &quot; border on Tuesday , including nearly all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicant , there are 13 families with small children and two older persons . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees stopped .
&quot; practically speaking , however , nobody has a view to be granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
elected asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
just a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke before the &quot; transit one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to break down . &quot;
&quot; they gathered the rub@@ b@@ ish , the tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks left . &quot;
lim@@ iting were broken down and one of the recording camp in the border area was rebuilt .
&quot; towards the objective of this renovation , nobody wanted to express itself . &quot;
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , only a few refugees arrive . &quot;
the country also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; but the 20.000 immigrants got settled in the country , however . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , around 1400 people wait for the drive to Germany . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of the train to Germany , the German authorities hal@@ ted on the morning of the German authorities . &quot;
during Freil@@ assing a few minor groups of refugees came to walk .
mayor of &quot; Gest@@ ran@@ som@@ ed &quot; about the border
&quot; we were occupied immediately after the bridge on Sunday with the charter , when ten people suddenly appeared with travel officers at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists wanted to pass by train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; because on Sunday , but because of the refugee flow the railway traffic was surprisingly short because of the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein in conclusion , &quot; as Stad@@ ler , who offered his help together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars crossed the border into the Na@@ he Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; previously , we fed the un@@ tested guests only once , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; it was obvious for us , &quot; &quot; as Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man had not to take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; we were very happy about that , &quot;
&quot; the train soldiers were moved on Sunday evening in W@@ els by a ICE train in a regional train to Pass@@ au , to make it after the short notice that rail traffic was set to Germany , yet to try more about the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was removed from the border into W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the bridge festival with the Bavarian neighbours , on Sunday afternoon , before a two @-@ bridge sp@@ orti@@ zation - organized by Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends an additional Z@@ ig@@ en@@ nia further to us and is a logical result of apparent holy politics :
&quot; rather than in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , on the construction of structures help , our Federal Chancellor , officially proclaimed and publicly acknowledged the stance of the Hungarian Government in the world of National Socialism . &quot;
Lei@@ d@@ tra@@ geous these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confron@@ ted with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; the poultry bar@@ ns will also have to recognize that the &quot; yel@@ ob@@ ese land , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will become a major challenge , in view of the continuing waves of refugees and the arriving win@@ ters , among us deser@@ ted states of protection seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and there will be another major - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad on the search of 35.000 winter@@ time qu@@ arti@@ eren
Konrad has fully committed all hands with the refugee deployment .
Christian Konrad is familiar to him that his word has changed .
the government has used the former Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank to establish quot@@ ing for thousands of refugees .
&quot; in the beginning of the death in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , Konrad has already gotten the chaos in the control centre . &quot;
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ veg@@ kirchen , &quot; he told his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation for 20,000 refugees who took place on Monday to Austria was without great vort@@ ex , Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; masterpiece . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the Interior Ministry spoke of a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad with an need of 8@@ 5,000 quarters were counted in the he@@ ur@@ igen year . &quot;
&quot; in order to accomplish the figure in the next few weeks , 35,000 accommodations will have to be found - 20,000 of the countries have to provide . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but there is no barrel without the ground , &quot; Konrad . &quot;
&quot; with the State Staff , he has already led discussions . &quot;
they had not been assured even for the upcoming refugees qu@@ arti@@ ce .
&quot; in Upper Austria , it runs good , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who shall be clari@@ fied as the Church will help . &quot;
great expectations are the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator also in the ORF action &quot; Help as we . &quot;
on the platform private individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodation .
&quot; in addition , it is hop@@ ed for hotels which are empty in winter . &quot;
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high &quot; yesterday .
&quot; in emer@@ gen@@ cies , it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ geber must comply with a certain amount of towel holders or the size of the upper fol@@ ks . &quot;
for a temporary period of time &quot; not@@ ion standards &quot; would apply .
&quot; by contrast to the Ministry of Internal Affairs , Konrad was founded with his experience in contrast to the Ministry of Interior . &quot;
I was an elderly man who is not yet revealed in the face of un@@ truth .
persu@@ asive force is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er does not cause the Republic no cost as they declare themselves .
their number of employees want to increase their number to three to four .
the own gro@@ unding not@@ ch was not yet successful until now .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz for a better division
not yet no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the City of Linz .
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment when people are concerned without these measures , the mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) says . &quot;
&quot; for the emergency , further sites are supposed to be tested on their capability . &quot;
criticism of the city centre in the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts have to contribute its contribution here .
maritime agreements : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday expressed another demonstration in the refugee question . &quot;
See@@ hofer gave me the insurance that the German border are not sealed .
the further travel of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
&quot; however , there is now just the corresponding limits . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , special trains with refugees to Germany do not exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; however , the seek@@ ers would use regular trains to Germany . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ er@@ inger once again requested greater solidarity in refugees . &quot;
&quot; however , Austria has also entered inspec@@ tions on its borders , for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger , &quot; a logical result . &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general restoration of the &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer division is officially completed .
&quot; the listed company in four of the six floors of office and production facilities is the listed IT Group S &amp; T , the remainder ( 2700 square metres ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes L@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine living in start@@ up companies in the New Ship@@ yard , and , later , to be acquired . &quot;
&quot; from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with its new neighbours - where Nieder@@ haus@@ er conclu@@ des some : &quot; the next run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to one @-@ third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of 2700 square metres of surface area in the building are already rented , and for another 40 per cent there is in@@ quiries . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ deed opened second business in the arcade
the new shop there are Fur@@ la hand@@ bags in the centre .
actually J@@ utta Bre@@ it wanted to buy a dog .
&quot; this project had to move the 49 year old woman of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the exchange market of Li@@ a Per@@ oni , in addition to another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the business where they sell among other bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and garments of different manufacturers , all about women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the for@@ la , wall@@ ets are now available from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop is in operation since yesterday .
&quot; first , several weeks were rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have thought for a long time to open a store , &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot;
&quot; among other things , among other things , the Fur@@ la @-@ producers , which are at home , was also done by the idea of their own site , where only their hand@@ bags are sold , done . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the grand interior of Linz to sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even has Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion interest has received Bre@@ it from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
&quot; most , if something is developing for me and I can show new trends in affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why so some woman when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag , she cannot answer the woman with the last safety . &quot;
&quot; maybe it is because a beautiful bag , every out@@ fit . &quot;
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the P@@ fäl@@ zer@@ land@@ lord of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place called An@@ ders . &quot;
this feature connects the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become a US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for comm@@ ot@@ hness .
&quot; whether he comments on foreign host@@ ile , rep@@ orters at State or Knowledge G@@ aps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the presidential presidential run ends steep@@ ly . &quot;
and cut off well .
this will also be registered in the p@@ fal@@ si@@ cal city of K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the real estate market will come from .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a key idea in the Win@@ tr@@ dorf on the Wine Route .
some TVs in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to -@@ zig corners with it is related to it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Palat@@ ine : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about his dump .
and what do the vill@@ agers of his aim to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow you find exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed by her K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ y has an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous jump lo@@ ot , which in addition to Tr@@ ump also belongs to the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ Family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , will come to word &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also , with the statement that he would certainly be successful even if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; he has not brought it to the king of his heart , &quot;
&quot; with respect to the performance of the family , but even the opinion that Tr@@ ump &apos; is already a little &apos; la@@ zy &apos; , says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; co@@ incid@@ entally , the nickname in which K@@ all@@ stadt lies in the circum@@ ference , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to High German : the legisl@@ ature says . &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of investors .
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather immig@@ rated to the US and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ s . &quot;
foundation of the property &apos;s property was first property of land in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy , their wish to return to homeland , in the Bavarian state , at which the Palat@@ inate was back then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he once received without hom@@ olog@@ ation , was the director of the Institute of p@@ fal@@ z@@ ic history and folk music , Roland Paul , explained to the film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ child of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ ig@@ ating statements of the estate .
he had repeatedly made mat@@ ured over Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border @-@ border to prevent illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the p@@ added , it &apos;s not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote relative of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , &quot; Op@@ a was borro@@ wed Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ em@@ akers would rather distance the Americans , &quot; he is always so up@@ set . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never takes care of the city . &quot;
&quot; the pension supplement used in Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm , such as certain K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz came with a visit to the church organ which was generally well preserved . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that the Donald &apos;s said , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it is better if he didn &apos;t gain the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I do not know if this is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the days at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like he , &quot; wouldn &apos;t he have arrived there at all . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Walter Bü@@ hler . &quot;
and as a president ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; the grapes are ripe , even without the president of Tr@@ ump . &quot;

&quot; today Today , a slight increase in comparison to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the previous Thursday ( 34@@ ,000 ) . &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seri@@ enst@@ ar of the river Erik Thomson .
&quot; the new drama of a recently poll@@ uted father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics asked whether Thomson could bear a hit show solo without the ra@@ fting star of Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the outcome of this evening was clear , with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven was strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and struck slightly on the block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
Seven was mixed results in evening two from The Chase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new Quiz show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe , an average 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win of Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening the first half hour from The Chase Australia increased 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20.000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening from The Chase Australia is determined to agree that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately end at 17 : 30 .
the Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars per minute which failed to over@@ ride the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : bach@@ elor &apos;s Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery un@@ revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly have perhaps un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly , who wins the bach@@ elor &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; the woman with the Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor &apos;s , was in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give price whether she is the one who has received the last Rose .
&quot; but when we , together with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows the day before three two will be checked , you might be given a reference to those who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood is holding his lips until the final on Thursday .
&quot; all three women have left the ly@@ rical line , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense for hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should receive the last Rose ? , &quot; their answers to the game would be , who won the heart of the Bach . &quot;
&quot; in spite of themselves , Mrs. Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki tried both to themselves - Mack@@ ay , as best partner for Wood . &quot;
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a good relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment on when I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ &apos;s energies re@@ noted , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I thought it was in the entire course of the show , &quot; &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing at the feet on Earth , it makes so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I &apos;ve seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes she and Sam have been very well suited as a couple .
&quot; from its point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the ma@@ iden trip last week made her clear that there was &quot; One &quot; to be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and my family , it became clear to me that this is not just a game - I &apos;m counting on him now , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose whom Wood should be choose , she was rather en@@ ig@@ matic . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love those remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ nes had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the United States - and there were many other teams , which sent after its impressive outstanding performance end at the end of last year . &quot;
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart choice .
some coach had attacked Hay@@ nes for the rest of the game to the bank than he lost a shot so as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by League for his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
&quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a punch , and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Washington . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula remained his true face in the dressing cabin after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding the ro@@ ok@@ ies , instead of grinding the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula ignored Hay@@ dn internationally in his press conference after the play .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sport journalist Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ dn was encouraged by speci@@ alt@@ e@@ ams , Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ he@@ y , who advised him to forget his car@@ pat@@ ted catch , and to take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne Pat@@ ented with a pun@@ t that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vik@@ ings .
&quot; it certainly was not the start , the Hay@@ ne , and the massive Australian authorities for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the field of playing field and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not be any worse starting in his N@@ FL career . &quot;
&quot; that was a thing which occurs every time , it just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ dn confused the rac@@ er with its Origin in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; otherwise , we will get tests in the Bavarian education system . &quot;

but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the free turn@@ out meeting now .
&quot; of course , the subject of Asyl@@ um is over@@ sto@@ cked , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
Ai@@ w@@ anger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria as it did during the Yugoslavia war in the 1990s .
&quot; so we don &apos;t have to go on to the causes , &quot; said the Free choice of elec@@ tors . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want free turn@@ out as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore Ai@@ w@@ anger also demanded more staff for the administration courts , responsible for asylum procedures : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
the FW @-@ boss critic@@ ised that several states are not consistent : &quot; we need nationwide po@@ or@@ ly standard standards of the states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria turns off , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to be vig@@ orous . &quot;
but the state policy should not fall under the table under the table .

&quot; the theme of the G9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the FW @-@ boss . &quot;
&quot; we call for election freedom for all gym@@ n@@ asi@@ ums , who want to . &quot;

4 people killed after police officers shoot at protest@@ ers in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police attacked Rub@@ mig@@ ra@@ de in a crowd forming the proposed new constitution , an official one on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; Bis@@ hn@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station where some of you have stones and fire@@ bom@@ bed . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said , the police had joined Tr@@ än@@ gs and shot up in the air before leaving it back to Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de . &quot;
only 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber vessels deployed , of which it is known that they can kill as a less deadly alternative , apparently a high mortality rate is produced . &quot;
&quot; the discussion was the last one week of violent protest in Nep@@ als southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of Madrid say that new provinces , which are formed within the scope of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the West Nepal of the Th@@ arus Group &apos;s ethnic group that wants to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were killed in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10 . &quot;
&quot; when the four major political parties had signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal under which hundreds had been controlled . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature agreed to vote on certain cl@@ auses in the Constitutional bill in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Old Post shall be built again .
the city is now preparing all for the marketing of the 4000 @-@ square meter area .
&quot; there is a blend of trade , trade and living room - but there is no specialized offers yet . &quot;
Em@@ den - Em@@ den wants to market a plot of approximately 4000 square meters in direct neighborhood to the Old Post Office .
the preparations are currently running .
&quot; planned to use the area for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing . &quot;
&quot; you wait for appropriate offers , that &apos;s the part of the city . &quot;
which investor is not yet clear .
no tre@@ aties were signed .
&quot; the town of Em@@ den had bought a part of the plot , which is located at the ring road / corner stone , already a few months ago and that can be seen from it . &quot;
project H@@ ie@@ ve : details are on the table
the plans for a holiday resort on the little sea at Em@@ den take shape .
the investor was publicly campa@@ igned for the project for the first time .
Some In@@ lier@@ ers are wor@@ r@@ ying - they are afraid to sell their leisure time refuge .
&quot; En@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated in closed doors for months has been set up , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday settlement at the Little Sea near Em@@ den is on the table .
&quot; Inter@@ est@@ ent , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; exhibited for the first time on Monday evening in the development committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot;
this point was originally part of the agenda on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .

Google starts recording campaign donations to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dup@@ lication campaign that is intended to bring up 11 million $ for humanitarian organizations that have led thousands of refugees trying to flee the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an unusual personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations in his blog .
&quot; instead of leaving a manager , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote , a Google assistant that fled with her family from Kabul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip took many dark rail trips and bus cru@@ ises , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but as the refugee and refugee crisis has grown in Europe , many people seek help with the help of my family . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations hosting assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first global donations raised up to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / , called to $ 11 million . &quot;
&quot; Europe is confron@@ ted with his worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many fled from war to Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

for slightly over@@ sized diabe@@ tics receive weight loss surgery helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly ob@@ ese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new trial .
it is still too early to say if there are slightly overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery which wrote an editorial for the new trial in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity . use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
&quot; they reduce hunger and lim@@ iting the body &apos;s own ability , to record food . &quot;
&quot; over the years , O@@ bes@@ ity operations have proved efficiently for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies were carried out with people who have disease ob@@ ese ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BMI , a certain degree of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BMI of 25 or above shows that someone is ob@@ ese and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data used to have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity and stomach cancer - related to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
&quot; the average BMI of those operated on this operation , declined from 31 to 24.@@ 5 until the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the BMI of those who were non @-@ surgical diabetes drug was approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who underwent surgical procedure , the onset of a surgical procedure has been completely dissolved at 36 % , and partly at 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison , the diabetes slow@@ ed completely only by one percent and partly at only approximately 2 percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyceri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ins &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
researchers also overs@@ aw the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; in A@@ 1@@ c , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best known as 7 percent . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c sank to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but these better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - like reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level , does not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team gained average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group compared to the Gast@@ re@@ frac@@ tom@@ y group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reached higher levels in the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 5.1 % ) and recorded a whole over@@ way of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show the survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of serious people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study NSC 631570 was subjected to obesity epidemic , with 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that demanded conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming up to people who are interested in the process . &quot;
&quot; that is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this low BMI group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that humans and their physicians should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we &apos;re waiting for too long , until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes , they have accumulated their body with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ ing really hard . &quot;

it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; all in Europe could not receive all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama , added that the real solution of refugee crisis in the Middle East said . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist Guide challenged efforts to termin@@ ate violence in the refugee community in refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the last refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech during the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies . &quot;
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also emphas@@ ized that the reaction of the West European countries ad@@ mi@@ red the refugee crisis of the refugee crisis , but the situation was not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; though the Dalai Lama promised Germany &apos;s participation in the encour@@ agement of the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful but in the meantime you need to re@@ consider long @-@ term solutions , as a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim lands . &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we must consider how the killing will reduce in their lands . &quot;
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; violence has never solved these issues , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence , and commented on George Bush &apos;s conduct after the terrorist attack of September 11 , emphas@@ ized that a war@@ violent attacks in the USA drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after 11 September , I have expressed my dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I said to him , the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he asser@@ ted violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of taking @-@ disinf@@ ection products by children in the last 4 years
&quot; tox@@ in control centres in the United States report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , who swal@@ low much alcoholic drinks , such as Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues in children under 12 years increased in tox@@ in control centers , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go up in the emergency door , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children can stop disinf@@ ect@@ ant , while some of them do to im@@ press their friends or for a mutation of the social media . &quot;
only videos on YouTube show how you@@ ths disinf@@ ect@@ ant drink only because of an inexpensive experience .
young children allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant with non @-@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a harder beverage .
younger children can be sc@@ utt@@ led by attractive sc@@ ents of the disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ked .
&quot; it provides disinf@@ ect@@ ant with strawberry , grapes and orange du@@ es , which are very appe@@ aling to children . &quot;
disinf@@ ect articles contain between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol .
very young infants may already cause a few sprit@@ zer for alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Gi@@ ft@@ emergency Center at the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let S@@ hear S@@ ø@@ ga@@ ze around , but people let these hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant be within reach of children , and when children come from it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had four spl@@ ashes away from the strawberry or disinf@@ ection apparatus at school , was put into an emergency relief . &quot;
&quot; her blood @-@ alcohol was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered as a adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey said she was a doctor &apos;s emergency doctor who treated them out at the G@@ win@@ ian Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah has listened to her words , and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency . &quot;
&quot; doctors overs@@ aw them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and hit his head , she said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ als Mother , CNN . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
&quot; Lop@@ ez has been recommended by parents and teachers , non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ection chie@@ fs outside the child &apos;s range . &quot;
&quot; out of alco@@ hol@@ ism , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 two women died in Ontario women , after the swal@@ lowing of hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; staff of health authorities are suspected that the product contained meth@@ anol , a fatal solution , instead of eth@@ yl@@ al@@ kohol , which had been noted as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students from the fourth class in New York were planning to pois@@ oning her &quot; &quot; Teacher &apos;s &quot; &quot; in order to pur@@ ge anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , so it reports a police report . &quot;
&quot; the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect disinf@@ ect@@ ants , and sent them out of their room . &quot;
the police viewed the corrupt plan as &quot; D@@ ut@@ ät@@ z &quot; and contra@@ cted disciplinary measures to the school agency .

former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and earlier national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic . there are no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; currently , an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they do not show highlights of Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they speak about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested .
there &apos;s a lot of tension in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games and there are not just the people in Scotland who want to see those games .
&quot; I will turn the things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eila . &quot;
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eila accepted that Cel@@ tic needs to be fighting but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things .
&quot; after the defeat of Malmö and the following departure from the Champions League , the defeat of 10 people from Aber@@ deen , now with five points lead to the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; D@@ eila said , &quot; Cel@@ tic had already bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel it is just like that - but we must continue .
we really need the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes players better .
&quot; now , together , it is so important . &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it rises in the UK in total . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1,@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate amounted to 5.@@ 9 percent over the UK@@ s , as shown by the offices of the Bureau for National Statistics ( for dating only ) . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland was 7@@ 4.0 percent , a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3,5 percent . &quot;
&quot; David Mund@@ ell , the State Secretary for Scotland , commented on the latest numbers and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan for the government has laid the foundation for a greater economy . &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish work market with an increasing employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I will be an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a little later , with the exception of a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens , and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in an audience @-@ gallery in the death chamber at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the tox@@ ins . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
&quot; the invitation for the first time was in January of his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day approached , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the U.S. , and there are often more applications than available to decide who will be elected a ma@@ z@@ ere lot@@ tery to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; who will be selected , it will be so emotional . &quot;
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , I will sit in the closest friend , with whom I developed my own relationship between the months with telephone data and a two and a half hours . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh often when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook or pen , to record what I see . &quot;
it simply needs to try to remember me all the details .
&quot; a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants , and you will receive access . &quot;
I compl@@ ained of her .
&quot; they admitted that &quot; &quot; it could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; &quot; but they still think that it is false , what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I was writing , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
&quot; I said to him , that he can remove me from his list of witnesses . &quot;
&quot; but he wants an international reporter , to be present there . &quot;
&quot; when he dies , he thinks the public relations work will aid movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ un@@ ware , a reporter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please hear the series of Podcasts that I have done . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese they would be guilty of being a favourable fact .
but I think there is a strong li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; in fact , I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot;
I believe his execution is wrong .
from that perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objec@@ tively .
&quot; there will be other rep@@ orters , where you can contact . &quot;
&quot; what you get from me is what it says , a man should die an unnecessary death . &quot;

&quot; sometimes you re@@ acts , and one has to live with the consequences , and I must live with it what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go ahead , and I want my owner , that I try my best for her . &quot;
&quot; if you start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; before , Moo@@ dy had carried out the bomb in an interview with rac@@ iti@@ ing.com that he had tried to sp@@ onate his stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Terry Bailey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart occupied a room with a man - whom I would be asked if I &apos;m asked what I do in my st@@ ables , I said Moo@@ dy in Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
apparently they believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that &apos;s the case , you should certainly take care of her n@@ oses because it is trying to sum me what they failed . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former President of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , CEO of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were well aware of the road and are still today . &quot;
should I make a look at the opinion that it is personally done ?
&quot; did the RV@@ L behave to behave , and perhaps people are responsible for persons responsible for what is going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and exp@@ ulse them , and I have no doubt that what I say is to think about it now . &quot;
&quot; now I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and it makes me sad . &quot;
that really makes me sad .
I will wi@@ eld the pressure on them and pushing it to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fruit juice levels of the coach have assembled a cob@@ alt @-@ based cob@@ alt @-@ study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching resulted in that he could only throw his licence about the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the non @-@ lag@@ ging Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the race @-@ treatment rule &apos; ridic@@ ulous &quot; after a packing had been applied on the legs of mud or clay , what was applied against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing .
I have to take on the full responsibility . &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my collabor@@ ators has ear@@ ed mud on the leg .
it could have happened yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday all day so what was like that .
but it was also the race day so .
Moo@@ dy could be confron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the racing day . an investigation on this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
&quot; people who set up these rules , don &apos;t know anything about the horse . &quot;
&quot; we all see one we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot;
man imprisoned after driver cur@@ ses
on the weekend the police arrested a man after a cl@@ ash with a bicy@@ cl@@ ist and subsequent driver escape in Cob@@ ram .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist was shipped to the Royal Melbourne hospital with severe injury , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray @-@ Valley Highway . &quot;
&quot; the police said , the drivers drove further , without stopping , to help the injured rider . &quot;
on Monday a 50 @-@ year old man from Nath@@ alia introduced the police in She@@ p@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be charged with driver support and inter@@ leaving assist and charged with other traffic jams .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Coach Craig Bell@@ amy succe@@ eding to fight against Ri@@ vals In case of alleg@@ ations
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites in the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators will have the support for the Storm @-@ Games &quot; Ring@@ ing &quot; with his team during the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night .
&quot; Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett really made reference to the Storm @-@ Team , after his crew achieved the final victory against North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game an &quot; &quot; exempl@@ ar &quot; &quot; of the Rug@@ by League , saying that the two of Queensland won &apos;t be &quot; good &quot; at R@@ ingen . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy , the team champ@@ ion@@ ed the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew , and said that she is hardly concentr@@ ating on her &quot; contact . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coach on his team is confident , as it might cover their concerns to be beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
that di@@ ps always up again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring battles as they have beaten us 24 : 2 &apos; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
&quot; I can guarantee that in all year we have changed nothing of our def@@ ensive system or the techniques . but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es into a real focus , and that made us the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he apparently tried to train a great team . it is therefore likely not to loose it , so it was a little shock for him . &quot;
&quot; it is funny , as it emerg@@ es again at this time of the year . &quot;
Bell@@ amy reli@@ ed on an idea for an exciting soccer team and is remin@@ ded of his ment@@ or that Benn@@ i St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; bo@@ red &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he did his play on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting their game was &quot; he said Bell@@ amy .
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was de@@ posed as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a bill of divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and let &apos;s watch as exciting , especially its young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game that wants to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they can play . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about to play against us . &quot;
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about it when it was about the big games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roo@@ ster increased higher results than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game but is it an exciting game ? &quot;
or are p@@ auses and don &apos;t take any points with any sp@@ amping ?
for me it &apos;s the game sched@@ ules .
&quot; when they mention us , it means we will still be met in a phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team has been on this weekend because it won the right to receive either North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I park next Saturday night . ticket sales kicks off next Tuesday morning . &quot;
&quot; valued with $ 200,000 Guaranteed after drug ad@@ age &quot;
&quot; a man who may have a life @-@ long punishment for his attempt to come to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that was for@@ ged to Queensland , but was released to a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the police found 100 kg of the Dro@@ ge on the Yacht Sol@@ ay who came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he did his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a possibly life sentence for the attempt , a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , argu@@ ed that there could be no evidence that he could have been trying to possess the entire amount and that in the cafe , might have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge of the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned about the risk of floods at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared to the Court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the case , he was lying in the police for his stay . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics Mother and father @-@ grandfather had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to secure its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the s@@ worn aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a safety of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; judges Fl@@ agan said . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not be sufficient to stop him , but he warned . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail ; under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Serbian passport to sign up for the police on a daily block at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to attract female pa@@ ell@@ oph@@ ile to the end of pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ itor used the telephone of a 11 year old girl to demand images of child abuse .
&quot; Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl when she was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , of whom he received a series of un@@ equal pictures of children sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl later woke up and found the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ ar@@ ming immediately her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police looked after this and looked after five pictures , analyzed then computer that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; searching &quot; &quot; Web @-@ research , the terms for searching for un@@ permanent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g claimed to the officials that he did it , as there would be &quot; &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile &quot; &quot; on the Internet &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; pret@@ ended to be a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in E@@ ili@@ ie Robertson , the Public Prosecutor , E@@ ili@@ ie Robertson , said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a Su@@ ch , - that he is ho@@ oked to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he gave the search for searching for the computer of him , but he said it was done , because he was claiming to be a polic@@ eman to start@@ up P@@ ru@@ th@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; he was asked after his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures , asking him to send more pictures . &quot;
he said he did so to enti@@ ce them .
&quot; he said , He is sick of the head when drinking , and said , he may see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Robertson added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother , and was cri@@ ppl@@ ed , and weeping . &quot;
&quot; she then looked , and con@@ front the accused pictures on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants . &quot;
the girl was interviewed and said that the def@@ endant has used computers and Play@@ station to talk to girls who are looking younger than he did .

defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im beg@@ ged that H@@ og@@ g appeared not to be seen in the Register of Sexual Crime as one can argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; can be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael has closed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case , but was kept in provisional custody for hear@@ ings on other cases . &quot;

to@@ wing way to little border transport to Germany
more refugees are increasingly captured along the major control points in the German @-@ Austrian border .
many mar@@ riages in fear of discovering and capture the people of smaller border trans@@ itions
&quot; a speaker of the Federal Police drawn up on the Austrian side , said : &quot;

the mass it takes : every two years the car makers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA ( Show more ) .
&quot; in 2015 , this is especially well @-@ known especially for the compact cars that currently sell themselves well . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently particularly asked : about 28.@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals were accounted for by the Federal Office of the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) in August alone .
this is reflected at the IAA ( Public Holidays from September 17 to 27 ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be presented by all the fut@@ ur@@ istic design vehicles and new upper class and luxury cars . &quot;
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Astra line powered by dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
the new Astra is also not expected to be much more expensive than the new Astra are expected to increase .
&quot; Opel presents an entry below the largest competition , VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra demonstrates the Opel Astra only as a fifth . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will be followed by the estate station , which is also shown at the International Motor Show . &quot;
and what will the Astra up to new compact car even at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ Compet@@ ent Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ x@@ e will exclusively be seen as a fifth , in a conventional and st@@ resses sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of next year , it comes as a station w@@ agon . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : totally new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan subsidiary wants to find its position in the highly growing segment with the new model .
this is the compact Infin@@ iti with its sho@@ cked lines fully integrated in the design line of the brand .
the basic model will have a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; in addition , a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp are also available . &quot;
&quot; Suzuki Val@@ eno : new in the segment also the Suzuki Val@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metre cell are deser@@ ving
Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht - Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the judi@@ pen@@ it@@ ary Te@@ gel right which was accommod@@ ated in a small cell .
&quot; because of injury to human beings , prisoners must be eligible for financial compensation in general , when they are found in too small cells . &quot;
this has been decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , those affected may then hope for money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the pits ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , an ex @-@ mate with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe . he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with approximately five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who was now in the out@@ ward journey of his lawyer , had been re@@ located within a larger cell . &quot;
his term resi@@ li@@ ent due to the terrible conditions of detention against the country of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the constitutional complaint brought the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Kammer@@ spiele in Berlin and transferred the case to new testing . &quot;
you see the man &apos;s human dignity .
the Chamber of the Chamber now decides about the compensation amount .
&quot; even though for legal reasons for the question@@ able period , only a few days of stay will be decisive for the compensation , be a bal@@ ancing supply . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; proof of the legal protection of the personality would be afraid . &quot;
the chamber must now clear the amount of money @-@ damage .
the constitutional amendments have already strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; thus they said in April a det@@ ain@@ ee of damage , because he was imprisoned in the prison nude . &quot;
human un@@ worthy is also a decision of 2011 according to the multiple @-@ assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
&quot; in addition , in addition , in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , which a det@@ ain@@ ee had agreed on a parallel housing in November 2009 , had agreed on a decent invitation . &quot;
&quot; the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs was , for three months , from 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ bad case . &quot;
the Berlin pris@@ ons had also hit the head@@ lines in the last weeks .
&quot; prisoners are kept growing again for 23 hours , with aggressi@@ veness , it shall be even before the det@@ ri@@ fied situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the judicial authorities 21 positions in Te@@ gel are un@@ owned due to new@@ bor@@ ough@@ s , 19 should fall away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of German Federal Ministry to Germany , following the Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) in Germany to absorb one million refugees . &quot;
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) noted in view of the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we are creating this . &quot;
&quot; which comes to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; according to different projec@@ tions , between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation by the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Pest@@ el @-@ Institut ) apartments annually - and for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living room is dramatic , but above all in affordable rental properties : 60@@ 000 to 80,000 social apartments are coming out of the rental price per year , and in order to apply these very cheap apartments also apply refugees . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros . &quot;
&quot; a lot too little is from the point of view of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social companies would have to develop , and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; in addition , scientists and federal state have agreed that there must also be more control advantages for investment in residential construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Voc@@ ational Research , 55 percent of the offen@@ ders in Germany can be employed . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualification , in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
&quot; however , for the integration of refugees , it is crucial if you will find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; labour is the key for social contacts , appreciation for the appreciation of the admission group but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ational researcher Dietrich Gen@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to Thr@@ ust@@ hardt , a political shift has been given to the thr@@ iller : the for@@ b@@ ade for refugees to be in recognition of labour . &quot;
&quot; while earlier , there was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the attendance of the asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in society itself - also due to the lack of skilled workers - in particular , the visibility was consistently carried out that refugees should be faster in access to the labour market . &quot;
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing language skills .
&quot; so far , there is no exclusive offer on general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are mostly medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; therefore , the creation of networks is , therefore , from Thr@@ ust@@ hardt to the Royal Path to integ@@ rating integ@@ rating . &quot;
&quot; Berlin school government has found that only a few of his parents have seen their children in the kit@@ ten , it is an estimated 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; for the ro@@ oted parents , it is only very important to hold the family , &quot; &quot; said Il@@ ja Kos@@ chem@@ a , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the benefits of K@@ ita , hand bal@@ lot distributed in different languages . &quot;
if the need for educ@@ ators are rising rapidly by the great number of refugees - the Berlin Senate are trying to increase the rate of training - about how he allows more technical schools .
students are prepared in the countries without German @-@ language skills at the classes .
&quot; but they are not always taught by the trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have an qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no lack of them , says Be@@ ate No@@ suitcase from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
&quot; according to the Deutscher Studenten@@ werk , Germany estimates that about 20 percent of the students are studying in Germany . &quot;
&quot; in principle , there is no state of asylum seek@@ ers or advanced students - the only exception until now Berlin , internal en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned its attitude . &quot;
study auth@@ orization to ensure access to university is easier .
&quot; for refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ ce does not get any benefits after the asylum seek@@ ers , if they begin studying . &quot;
&quot; the latter , in principle , no other B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they do not fall under the circles of the disabled persons . &quot;
&quot; ge@@ mon@@ ed refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be eligible to show B@@ af@@ ö@@ v @-@ entitled , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; this financing l@@ ücke must also be closed , demands Steffen Schröder , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German student works . &quot;
the students should now get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g at once .
&quot; in future , Islam is committed to play a more important role because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
the state should su@@ stain the same rights as they have the same rights as they have the churches and develop the existing state @-@ churches @-@ right to a new state @-@ religions relationship .
the establishment of a Islamic Wel@@ fare Association is also important to take care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
&quot; at the right hand , too . &quot;
&quot; so , the representative of Islam must unite and be willing to cooperate with the State in many sectors and to break some control options . &quot;
&quot; on this occasion , the read@@ iness to take heed against religious grounds . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , commented on the concern of concern and religious conflicts also to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to have such conflicts in Germany would immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , at times , in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will now represent a lot more than today a matter of society .
&quot; in this way , the majority of Europe will change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is urgent . &quot;
&quot; Germany - as a result of European decisions - since a decade of anti @-@ discrimination , there has been an anti @-@ discrimination and conflict law . &quot;
&quot; it is very slow to learn how the NSU @-@ m@@ ord@@ ons showed , in the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
the same chances for everyone : what mig@@ rant organizations and the advoc@@ acy groups do not demand a long time and the international agreement as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism prevention in Germany need to be reality when the country will remain peace@@ fully and its new citizens should benefit their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; in general , Germany might be able to provide medical care for the so anticipated refugees , President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - Power and capacities , we do that , &quot; he said to the daily mirror . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money has to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery calls for outstanding actors right at the registration of health cards . &quot;
&quot; later , services could later be reck@@ oned with the federal states . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it was highly question@@ able , so many people with the limited range of performance , to see the asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
otherwise the doctors do them all make the language pair .
&quot; until now , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ t has demonstrated that migrants are subjected to worse than their diseases as other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical surg@@ eries , they should have taken on the interpre@@ ting costs . &quot;
&quot; many refugees would also be helped with more common medical pan@@ es to emergency ambul@@ ances , too . &quot;
and with another diagnostic glance .
&quot; for community @-@ groups , there are much more un@@ used disabilities , and in the young@@ sters there are about HIV re@@ education . &quot;
&quot; with the partial other grade of disease , German doctors found them from their education , however , Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite dec@@ ay or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize , &quot; and as for the physicians , the refugees tend to even come in sight through the refugees . &quot;
the Syrians have developed a highly developed education system ; some refugees are even doctors .
&quot; however , in order to practice , they would have to prove their qualification and bl@@ ur@@ red again . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is psych@@ ically ill after estimates of the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist otherap@@ eutic ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic alignment or depression .
&quot; they are especially vulnerable to refugee children , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ Pt@@ K . &quot;
a recent study of TU Munich demonstrated that every fifth Syrian refugee organization is trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
&quot; anyone who is ill in a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress condition is suffering from the so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , heart ras@@ cals and death breaks . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include up@@ - and concentration problems , strong scre@@ wing and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms from chronic , an early treatment was necessary , explained mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees have received a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although mentally ill @-@ seek@@ ers can put an application for a psych@@ otherapy , however , the processing usually lasts for several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social departments , non @-@ workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , would determine whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; it often lead to false ass@@ essments , says Mun@@ z . &quot;

Zimbabwe : Robert Mug@@ abe instruc@@ ts false speech in parliament .
&quot; in the beginning of the year , Mr Mug@@ abe was the oldest leader in Africa . &quot;
&quot; he was un@@ hurt , but the video of the case spread rapidly over social media . &quot;
&quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by representatives of the opposition , that they had been warned of anonymous duc@@ ers and warned them against Mr Mug@@ abe . &quot;
&quot; last month , she had hat@@ ched him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of Parliament in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Oppos@@ itions who have received text messages sent on their cell who warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mug@@ u@@ it .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mug@@ u@@ it &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they warns of the affected Parliament that the immun@@ ity of the Parliament is ending , and as soon as they leave parliament , its parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; the lead speaker , conducted by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , is concerned about the dangers for politicians . &quot;
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is set up to 30.000 new jobs
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to be 25.000 to 30,000 jobs in the scope of re@@ structure and savings efforts at the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will divide into two listed companies and publish the computer and printer business from his fast @-@ growing company hardware and business activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job reduction leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , and said HP in a statement . &quot;
&quot; these re@@ structured activities will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ s and Chief Executive , which should guide the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is becoming smaller and more focused as HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ly portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ sales and &quot; will be concentr@@ ating on providing an integrated technology solutions for companies so far , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it was divided by a company which was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , in order to create electric plants and the Palo Alto Garage you called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot; &quot;
HP has a massive re@@ structure to manage the turning of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area which is based on the belief that strongly focused under@@ performing enterprises a better performance . &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates are facing the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the late Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed from Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and when his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimi@@ stic scenario is already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the big dis@@ grace with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate Kn@@ uck@@ le injury , and then returned to its old moment@@ um during the pre@@ season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened with career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
there is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is no longer matter .
that was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in connection with his Kn@@ uck@@ les , or with the injuries he had previously had . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from purely medical point of view , but like Wen@@ ger , there are the corresponding danger of further injuries , always when a player tries to return to the middle of the season . &quot;
it is also an un@@ pleasant pattern .
&quot; according to the investigation , Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has around 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago . &quot;
&quot; he also played in just 65 from Arsen@@ e , when 157 lig@@ asp@@ el in the last five playing times . &quot;
the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 .
Wen@@ ger does not accept the potential of a v@@ icious circle but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the prevention rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from a violation , you have a decent time period , a time where you must strengthen your body and win fight . &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and run through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
Arsenal begins its Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea in Saturday and at the Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger is offering a rotation within the team .
&quot; he applied to Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not following Croatia , which means Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta is going to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ on Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to stop the balance and the players who need it to indul@@ ge a small car@@ bure@@ au , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal &apos;s clear targets , through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the largest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ able effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched during the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was struck on Tuesday night through an earthquake , where the Richter scale was 3,2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is aware that arsen@@ al crossed the doctrine of the past season with the champion @-@ League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains driven by far hope to lead the association to his first European ok@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is imm@@ en@@ sely , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Arsenal had never worked with arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand , I &apos;m long enough in the business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
friendship party : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open themselves , now even more desper@@ ate than ever , as self @-@ mor@@ se among young men on a 15 @-@ year test@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men ranging from 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and three times more frequently in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the issue , the Camp@@ aign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ects ( CA@@ LM - Camp@@ aign against a her@@ ed@@ itary life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man to question the culture in question , to seek assistance if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noticed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances on recovery had doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mental healthy friends en@@ counter@@ act the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; of course , you have to have friends who can work for friendship . &quot;
&quot; in the age of social media , with its emphasis on substance over substance , the in@@ ability of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to sound strong , fun , and successful , even though the isolation is dominated by reality . &quot;
&quot; this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values provide ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner long@@ ings for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire founded recently , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the nice thing with friends was that these focus was put on the head .
&quot; every character has not been defined by his job , but by his personality , which in@@ advert@@ ised by the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent h@@ ugs , moments at the football gu@@ cks in cozy arm@@ chairs and the nostal@@ gia of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of knowing that men are looking forward to explore fully their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of phone call it told me : ... &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ murdered , has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interaction of friends can make a difference . &quot;
&quot; the men who contact us , often feel unable to speak with friends . &quot;
&quot; the old Rede@@ mption , &quot; I come to right , &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , when one speaks about problems . &quot;
&quot; friends is one of the shows which comes to me in the sense , when I try to offer long @-@ heart@@ ed rit@@ ating mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; clearly , it clearly shows the small moments of men friend@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; so very successfully my objective Ex@@ hau@@ z status via the telephone to watch the people in desp@@ air to desp@@ air , as long as long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely new back@@ drop , why do not take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better when you &apos;ll be sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know which difference could make your friendship .

Maria joins in order to help PS@@ G reg@@ - Malmö
Angel Di Maria is Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Edinburgh son Cav@@ ani after sett@@ ling with Malmö .
di Mary hits his debut at the Champions League on Tuesday and helping PS@@ G to pass in Malmö .
here are the Game Report and the response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edinburgh have kept this course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain claimed his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the stadium stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League deb@@ ited as PS@@ G player , who brought the French Master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions , before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute was achieved a head door . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and S@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A you need a strong start against the Swedish Master , as they stri@@ ve not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ Round @-@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ final in each of the final three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was no classic game of Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ s team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ard missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown @-@ team and against the association with whom he started his illustr@@ ative career back in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to create and look back to look back , even though there are certain things that we have to endure in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; it is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win , and we won , although I regret that we were not yet posted on or two more gates . &quot;
&quot; Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to his injury in one of three modifications to the Paris @-@ Team , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but was chosen by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ my was named as the man , who was taken over to the next stage in Europe when he ran over to the next stage in Manchester United States , and he pointed out why , when he finished in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is pass behind the Malmö defense , he finished in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Cel@@ tic struck in a play @-@ off to reach this level , entered the pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and had a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle part of a heavier opponents . &quot;
&quot; but except a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ da@@ j@@ ic , who passed far from Kevin Tra@@ ins P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they carried forward a little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself stayed on , with some mis@@ ses and bad conclu@@ sions , not least was patented alone by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not less than five experiments solely in the first half and then abandoned it after the re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; still he demonstrated much more skill when he brought his fellow players to play , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic which Di Maria was transformed into a scri@@ p@@ ting , which was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate was finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans scored his sixth season , after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had f@@ ished a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; that ended all the thought that Malmö could go back to the game , and just an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz was able to stop the final result before substitute e@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi was finished . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish league that did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fications do not suff@@ ice .
hat@@ s off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on playing diversity in film format
&quot; Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ American filmmaker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the variety and said , she will not be behind the scenes . &quot;
&quot; during a series of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , stressed as this need to emphas@@ ize alternative perspectives , in regards to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then you do it to the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; Brown re@@ acted to sho@@ cked with s@@ worn un@@ belief and cried &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . &quot; al@@ right , &quot; when the comments of the actors of The Mar@@ tian decided . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown , however , joined the production of production of Ben affair and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I would like to encourage people to think about it - who will always be the director , as she is dealing with the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line beaten by her white accessories . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ ac@@ cio for direct rights to the film , &quot; Dam@@ on said that her direc@@ ts &quot; in the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pressed his anger over the clip as he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO W@@ ING that it &apos;s pain@@ fully . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5.000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 lique@@ urs since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on comments come to a date where exact rac@@ ical representation in the media is at the fore@@ front of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Black Li@@ ves was able to state labor and the legisl@@ ature and authorities , discri@@ min@@ ating practices against col@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards . &quot;
&quot; album stopped necessarily , ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their significance . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves &apos; motion have published a declaration in response to the question of Fox News @-@ Person@@ nel Elisabeth Hass@@ el@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hate @-@ group . &quot;
&quot; the Black Li@@ ves Network is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;

&apos;@@ American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
&quot; professional sports clim@@ bs and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first Ath@@ let , who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participants , who eliminated all stages of his obst@@ acle course . &quot;
&quot; during the seasonal finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the finals . &quot;
for the last purpose the climbing on a 75 walk @-@ long clim@@ ber portion was in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time when he finished the first Ath@@ let , which finished the most exhau@@ sting phase 4 by American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster than the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock over the winning of the Great Prize of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or for my life , &quot; said Isaac E ! over his he@@ ap . &quot;
so suddenly .. how I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the Chief Executive Produc@@ er K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood writers to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished first at the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , money goes to the quick@@ est person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it is the one of the quick@@ est time , &quot; says We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll swe@@ ep through it .
he just did so lucky to have done what he did .
&quot; masses of awards , he received from fans . &quot;
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off told me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt at the same time when it had sw@@ aps the roles .
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an awesome Season that will start fil@@ ming in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sli@@ ps on Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ ER@@ APO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today the tig@@ ers face the last place in the American League Central .
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played perfectly against Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field . &quot;
the T@@ wins w@@ asted an opportunity to climb in a second half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , although only for an evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so difficult to deal with a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories do fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Des@@ m said . &quot;
&quot; tiger Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive support , when Detroit points three times in the first two inner ings , then in the sixth and then once again in the ninth time . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) smote the 1 / 3 inside the 1 / 3 inside and enabled three cri@@ es .
it was just his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I would finish this year to finish this year , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw at the bull@@ row every game , and therefore I am going to concentrate entirely in the game . &quot;
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns with his first R@@ B@@ Is in mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit parade by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle on 6 July .
&quot; he has weak@@ ened the sticks , &quot; said expressions . &quot;
&quot; he looked fine when ( impact training ) , saw clearly better in the Bull@@ pen , and he brought it right into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three rounds in the back@@ grounds at the end of the 7th place , T@@ wins still had their best chance to come back to play . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ er Aaron H@@ icks finished a colourful and Simon called his second bass player Brian Do@@ zier before it was replaced by the Bla@@ de Har@@ dy le@@ bar .
&quot; Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man who was confron@@ ted with whom he was confron@@ ted with the newly designated Rook@@ ie kn@@ uck@@ man Miguel S@@ ano , who delivered two @-@ run Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runs and the finished runner , the third Col@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe took part in front of a Double Play . &quot;
&quot; it was that in the Major League , the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ n hit a Double Play . &quot;
after being added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth I managed to put a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and generated the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
&quot; the sp@@ ell @-@ handed , however , S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth will be saved . &quot;
Detroit benef@@ ited from the opening of the game by an even mobile Phil Hughes .
&quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three r@@ uns in the first two coun@@ ters against the right @-@ handed b@@ veter@@ an , who was canc@@ eled before the game of the sp@@ ill @-@ list after suffering because of a back suffering more than a month . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished me , &quot; said Hughes , &quot; but I felt better when I detached and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; having received the lead off the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , H@@ earned a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z performed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ning in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; third Pri@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right hand , made a further run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
the tig@@ ers made a second one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ itor said . &quot;
he was not particularly well beaten but he got the right spot .
Hughes was on the Count @-@ Count in a pitch giving no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver Rec@@ eiver A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter soon .
Hughes were among the three hits for three hits and a four Stri@@ ke@@ over walk .

I think that failed follow @-@ on military options must not take place without Germany . &quot; he said .
he designed the European states &quot; colle@@ c@@ tively look . &quot;

Austria controls in southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian interior minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared an Austrian TV station on Tuesday night , and no one was sent back to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; also , Germany did not send refugees back to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , it has been agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could start a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said it has already given advice between the Director General Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
&quot; given concrete figures , she did not refer to talks in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees came from the so @-@ called bal@@ kan@@ ers from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
your goal is mostly Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit in cooperation with several other EU leaders in cooperation with several other EU leaders .
Germany had started depart@@ ing with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; so far , the EU states have not given themselves to joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; on upcoming Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU Minister for the Interior lies at a special meeting to make a new move to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee ship in Germany , the federal government wants to support the state &apos;s first @-@ intake and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; in late Tuesday evening , the federal government announced it with the minister of managing meetings with the minister &apos;s President in the Chanc@@ ell@@ ery of the German Chanc@@ ell@@ ery in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lining , those people who br@@ ittle the protection . &quot;
but who don &apos;t have any pet perspective does not exist in Germany either .
this conception has been classified immediately into the round .
the German Chancellor emphas@@ ized that the state as a whole had to handle a &quot; huge power handle . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are meanwhile stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilometer border to Serbia in the night for Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours afterwards , the government announced that it was going to stop the border with a fence . &quot;
this neighbour is not part of the EU as Serbia .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent the leading chrom@@ ati@@ zation of Romania , the former Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
&quot; there were first ar@@ rests of people who had passed the fence . &quot;
&quot; in Turkey , thousands of immigrants came to the Greek border with thousands of migrants on their way to the Greek border . &quot;

Rome has now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square . &quot;
in the presence of the president Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino a well @-@ known place was baptised on the name of the German re@@ former on the Opp@@ io Hill .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now acknowledged as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
it was applied in Rome by the working community of the protest@@ ant churches .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Protestant Lutheran congregation in Rome , remin@@ ded that the Protest@@ ants were able to live in the city of the Pop@@ es about centuries as a minority , in the in@@ ward parts of their faith . &quot;
the place was also evident in symbolic ways that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) became a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the year of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 in Rome for a few months .
he abandoned the town then as a hand@@ ful of sin .
his negative impressions could be encouraged by histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
&quot; then , Luther had then introduced the split divisions of the Western church with his thes@@ es . &quot;
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the major works created by Ot@@ mar old for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and news texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that has now appeared with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the image for Ot@@ mar Old , who has form@@ ulated all of his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations Bible stories on paper and canvas as depicted in 150 designs . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received - but by no means consistent with &quot; funny &quot; images . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can quite be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; for three years , Ot@@ mar old worked at his Bible project for which he made a sub@@ jective artistic selection from the many theme areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles were developed by cycles such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments , or pat@@ ern@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; he spont@@ aneously fascin@@ ated two partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his main emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is mainly the author , Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who laid himself on the basis of painting with the respective Bible verses . &quot;
&quot; he will interpre@@ t the interpre@@ ting of the former interpre@@ ts by Ot@@ mar old and so today , into current connections . &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; embedded in the author of the original Bible of Martin Luther , each with a sentence of the artist , who is form@@ ulated all of his personal thoughts on the situation in this situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden sand .
&quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old enables a double insight into his soul , emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
&quot; ultimately , emotions have ultimately been a cataly@@ st for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar old , born in 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and raised in Berlin , coming from a family to the strict protest@@ ant ruler of the Order . &quot;
&quot; there the up@@ bringing was on with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar old &quot; remembers . &quot;
&quot; I tried to move , to bear me , perhaps again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
his second concern was to revi@@ ve art in faster time again : &quot; the perception of images today is characterized by advertising and which is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have somewhat mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Old wants to &quot; &quot; watch the viewer in the images &quot; , &quot; they let themselves act , discover and sense that force they have : &quot; &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , and on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; had always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art &quot; &quot; I like what he understands with his images . &quot;
&quot; rather , I don &apos;t care about the Bible to fully understand the Bible , but also mysterious issues . &quot;
&quot; that was not an association with eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about images that are explained &quot; only . &quot; may be a pictures of the Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans @-@ Mö@@ ni@@ hler from the Luther @-@ Verlag , this book is an invitation to &quot; to deep@@ en its life and freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for someone both the ( biblical ) language of love than also the responsibility .
&quot; part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen pictures , presented for the first time in an exhibition launched on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation . &quot;
construction start for BM@@ X rail t@@ ins
&quot; plans were made , place found , company commissioned , earth @-@ run for a circuit model : one year later nearly everything was ready - yet before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was finished . &quot;
&quot; precip@@ itate in politics and administration , mainly with the inhabitants that didn &apos;t toler@@ ate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill S@@ ays off , new place - now with formal planning and application for construction permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will come in October , and was able to inform Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock from the Children and Youth Committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
it should be started without a &quot; additional memory &quot; with the works at the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the major division puts it a clear sign at the weekend . &quot;
football responded to the getting @-@ in location in Germany and sec@@ ures policy help with managing the upcoming problems .
&quot; I hold that for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in the principle , nothing goes wrong , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested every individual to get this topic in the grip , &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B Chef Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ell@@ ery and meet there as Minister for State , Ms Ö@@ z@@ abon@@ imana and the German Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the theme will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and wants to help .
however the decisive points must be politics .
&quot; for this reason , the German football League therefore stressed his refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for an Welcome &quot; to four years . &quot;
&quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach declared at the ver@@ ge of the UEFA EURO in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some states also support this program .
&quot; on this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ f@@ l put a clear sign at this weekend if the name of the &quot; &quot; We will help &quot; &quot; enter # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left side of the name &quot; We will help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that all of them should help wherever and how they can &quot; , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen sporting chief Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; Self @-@ intel@@ li@@ gi@@ bility . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes every person , nobody can see it away . &quot;
&quot; we can use the German Bundesliga , no , we need to use our jet power to aid our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees that have already been an incredible success , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ He@@ ms director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent mark in the league . &quot;
&quot; to the@@ European quali@@ fier against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Nier@@ s@@ bach specified the support of refugees as &quot; a big team@@ work with German football . &quot;
the 36 license agreements had started in their own projects is great .
great is that small and smallest associations active there .
&quot; message &quot; 1 : 0 for an welcome , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous significance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this year , the association will jointly provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the German government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole world for 2015 , &quot; K@@ id@@ s@@ bach reported . &quot;

football : Bv@@ Q - Without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ table in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for an com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us will definitely be defeated in the first group of the Europe League . &quot;
&quot; the championship table will also be missing the football league in the football league in the du@@ el , with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 / Sky ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately we cannot go back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B Coach has left open , we expect a return from him to Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ kel will not only change its trunk to the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change to the door@@ ke@@ epers .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of St@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains the World Champion at an absolute top level , &quot; praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if the turn@@ table in the future is used in all Europe league games , Tu@@ es@@ chel is open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also quit the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ge statements of Mit@@ er Re@@ us , argu@@ ing that the finale for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europe league will be the goal , with@@ holds Julian W@@ eig@@ l &apos;s comprehen@@ sible to say : &quot; that is why Marco is not that wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to retri@@ eve the title .
robot cars : government wants a pioneering role for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be technological lead after the will of the Federal Government . &quot;
the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of transport ministers Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) which provides investments in expanding digital infrastructure .
&quot; on the outskirts of the Autom@@ esse International Motor Show at the Frankfurt Motor Show , Do@@ brin@@ dt was presented by a &quot; new mobility age . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated driving and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and bring to less traffic , said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
he will also discuss the topic with his counter@@ part from the G7 states that were together with representatives of the industry .
&quot; among other things , the Strateg@@ ic Paper of the Department of Transport is st@@ resses the importance of the mobile broadband expansion and a generous donation to digital radio stations . &quot;
&quot; during testing new technology , test track is currently taking on the highway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid the &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany will be able to use internationally that the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the Federal Government will also appeal to a change in the Vienna Convention but only the people as a driver has seen . &quot;
&quot; when automated driving takes over the car &apos;s leadership , the driver will be more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras , which detect the environment and process the data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; based on a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on high@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , travel @-@ free vehicles are expected to be expected to be expected shortly after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany location , the authors of the study estimate an estimated 8.4 billion euros by 2025 . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the vehicle can lead to more safety and efficiency under road traffic , &quot; said SPD traffic officer S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l said . &quot;
&quot; the question of liability for accidents and safety of the personal data of the driver must be clear , however . &quot;
still the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French@@ men or Americans .
a pre @-@ staged survey of the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday at the AA Pro@@ xim@@ isation DE@@ K@@ RA occurs that only eight percent of Germans think that autonomous cars could prevail over the next ten years - 32 percent do not believe it at all over 20 years now - 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
&quot; in France , 21 percent of respondents say to 2025 by autonomous cars , in the US 33 percent . &quot;
anyway the drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on an independent vehicle .
&quot; according to a survey carried out by the digital chambers , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; at the highway , that could already be 15 percent in the flowing traffic , at St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , everyone would leave a car to the car under no circumstances . &quot;

&quot; this is a giant loss for our team . &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant audience
it &apos;s a mixture of quite large Mo@@ den@@ schau and a juni@@ per @-@ monkey @-@ cub@@ an : the designer Jean Paul Rev@@ .2 ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
&quot; the highlights : window man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which are made super @-@ like thanks to video projec@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as Stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and there@@ with that he put men in skirts . &quot;
today I can &apos;t say that I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant of the Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair .
&quot; previously it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk to The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed its first look at a show about his person at the Kuns@@ thalle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation . &quot;
&quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; for me there was a little bit of death to me , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you enter into the museum . &quot;
&quot; the impressive collection had previously made in Montreal , Montreal and in Paris . &quot;
&quot; it is so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance , and vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the barely out@@ dated works of the man who has written fashion history without ever completed an apprentices@@ hip .
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not constructed , but it is a highly chore@@ ograph@@ ed work of work , for which a great effort was operated : in order to fr@@ at@@ ize the pup@@ il , for example , a styl@@ ist is engaged . &quot;

&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , I said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
Gaul@@ ti@@ ers &apos;s old ted@@ dy is also to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ re @-@ fashi@@ oned attempts by the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he attracted his Teddy B@@ HS and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; with a doll to play , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him . &quot;
the dis@@ card of fashion he subsequently joined himself .
&quot; he st@@ ole fashion magazines and outlines the designs of other designers , such as Gaul@@ tier says in Munich . &quot;
&quot; later I bought it , of course . &quot;
for his first own show he does not have to pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - Pl@@ ener tip as fashion n@@ ical
&quot; in the past , it went to the long shi@@ r@@ ents in and around Pl@@ auen , trying to do meters . &quot;
&quot; the best materials and tips were used in large quantities for customers , such as ceilings and gar@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; today , the company works no more , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the car@@ riages . &quot;
instead of course the fashion is again important .
&quot; in the starting times of Pl@@ au@@ ener tip , fashion played a bigger role , then moved through the home textiles industry - and is re@@ discovered now as a niche . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt reports some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called Vintage mode , which leans on the date of pens , is an increasing Customer . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has no niche in the textile branch in Germany , is no longer in the market . &quot;
they are already taking the half of all orders already .
mo@@ ats Pl@@ auen is together with nine other companies member of the industry association of Pl@@ au@@ ener tip and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years around 80 % of sales were broken .
&quot; private trade stores and also wholesale , there are almost no longer wholesale . &quot;
we hardly reach our products on this path .
&quot; these products are produced much cheaper in the Asian region , and is almost exclusively sold by chains . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the export business is exported , currently in Russia and the USA . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to focus through environmental consciousness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; we have been leading a quality seal that we produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diplom@@ ats Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger department of the Saxony College of Z@@ wick@@ au - and specialized in the fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized on embroi@@ dery and tips .
&quot; to ensure the competition from the Asian region , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a conflict between the lively ideas of the designers and factories , which must be thinking purely economic , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a existing design will often only be varied , to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; some years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter new the historic snow tip . &quot;
the machine goes on to some places small ch@@ icks .
&quot; the grand gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ ths of Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ chs put him inspired : &quot; previously , I could not start with traditional pl@@ eting point . &quot;
now they are using the Snow@@ drops for their jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , they character@@ izes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener tip - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies the USA , to Australia and to Finland , especially to customers , whose ancestors had lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and who want to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
in this way I see my jewelry as a modern amb@@ ass@@ adors of Pl@@ au@@ ener tip .

XI raises the worlds to open the economy in wide open to the world
&quot; the economy must not open wider out@@ wards , to fo@@ ster growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping said on the Tuesday of a group sent to reform the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should be used to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how , and to improve the strategies of business start , &quot; he said in an address close to the 16th session of the Central Committee for Deep@@ ening A comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; re @-@ start to promote and push out reforms will bring new moment@@ um and vitality , and offer new space for economic growth , said X@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the leadership Group has adopted a number of direc@@ tives , including a neg@@ ativity on the regulation of market access , relaxation of the level control policy , help from public businesses ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the citizens of the population . &quot;
&quot; after the Statement , there will be a negative release , identified by sectors and companies that do not come into question . &quot;
&quot; after testing , the system is tested and improved by test programs . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is of importance , since it shows a major role in the allocation of resources , which ensures a legally binding business environment and open the market open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also cur@@ c@@ ate controls to the companies that are transferred to companies and ensure that companies are choosing their business .
the statement also said that China will allow the border areas to explore new models of border crossing economic co@@ oper@@ and to explore new mechanisms in action .
&quot; in the framework of an offer , state controlled sectors , additional areas are opened for private investment . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment , and will protect the righ@@ t@@ ful interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and bring better services to them , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by making the requirements optimised and facil@@ it@@ ates the application process . &quot;

EU wants to double the mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes , thus making consumers a clearly higher dose of nervous feeling . &quot;
&quot; the Consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who is a first working draft of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans in a sharp business paper : &quot; risks and effects of missing industrial and environment policy , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt von F@@ ood@@ Kn@@ auer . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve pois@@ oned for large fish at the end of the food chain like shar@@ ks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are to be raised by two milli@@ gram of mercury per kilogram of fish . &quot;
big pre@@ dat@@ ors are so strongly al@@ igned with mercury that are on the basis of still existing limits to be sold approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches .
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ available . &quot;
&quot; in exchange for this sl@@ ing , the EU wants to reduce the limit values with other fishes from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this but as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller cem@@ y@@ fish , such as car@@ p mostly bur@@ dened as low as they are already holding the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the lowering of cl@@ an@@ ings was &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des di@@ ver &quot; that helps the economy alone , &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mercury is a highly highly highly highly highly toxic heavy metall . this is highly enriched over the food chain especially in car@@ ni@@ f@@ fish .
the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; there are already small amounts to cause severe damage on the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry announced on his website with regard to relevant maximum values but that a &quot; health threat of general population &quot; is not expected .
mercury could be transported to the environment in particular by coal combustion .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Health , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock ordered more than six metric tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total produced in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanent and nationwide , &quot; had quoted the &quot; Spiegel &quot; in March of the paper . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , mercury in fish with the most commonly reported health risks included in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF . &quot;
