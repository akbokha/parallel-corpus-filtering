&quot; the agreement could be closed down to the total amount of EUR 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion of the amount paid by the credit@@ ig@@ er@@ land ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery plans for the member countries . &quot;

&quot; containers and in@@ fusion devices are provided in front of shipping with an in English and French , which contains the pattern contained in the units 2 to 10 . &quot;
human whole blood must be sent only in containers where the temperature can be kept at 4 C up to 6 C throughout the whole tran@@ sports .
&quot; the drugs mentioned in Part II of these protocols and devices must be sterile , ap@@ y@@ ated , and toxic . &quot;
it is recommended to add the programmes required to in@@ fusion required devices and solvents .
human whole blood is a healthy people and mixed with an appropriate anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant blood .
&quot; C ) the non @-@ free are transmitted by blood trans@@ fu@@ sions @-@ transfer@@ able diseases , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history . &quot;
&quot; the blood @-@ taking takes place as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is characterized by a closed , ster@@ ling tube system into a sterile bottle , in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution was fu@@ elled before steri@@ li@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; after the termination of the blood , the bottle is immediately shut down and cool to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . thereafter , it may only be opened immediately prior to the use of blood . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution must not be more than 220 ml per litre of human blood , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster concentration must not be lower 97 g per liter . &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is designed to determine the blood cells and ser@@ ology . determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by examination of blood cells at a new sample of the dispens@@ er .
&quot; as far as for blood group determination in individual countries , or recommended procedure , these are to be applied . &quot;
&quot; the designation R@@ h @-@ negative is only to use when specific investigations have the default of the anti@@ gens C , D , you and E . &quot;
&quot; according to this Convention , blood should only be used for recei@@ vers of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group . &quot;
&quot; human whole blood is available in sterile , closed bottle before micro@@ organisms are stored and up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are allowed only during testing and transport necessary times , which is at most 30 minutes to cool down immediately to 4 to 6 C . &quot;
a concentration of human red blood cells is a unit of human blood blood that has been removed from the most important part of the plasma .
it contains all red blood cells of unity that has been obtained ; other blood cells can be present or can be partially removed .
&quot; the fluid content of the concentration consists of either the remaining plasma or of a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial aqu@@ eous solution , which was added after the plasma distance . &quot;
&quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit ) is shown on the label . &quot;
&quot; all necessary processes must be done under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the sampling must be made under pressure , closed system and exclusively by pressure . &quot;
&quot; an artificial ins@@ ane solution has been added , so the label is also shown in their volume and composition . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is won by de@@ hydr@@ ation of the liquid , which reli@@ es on the cent@@ ri@@ fug@@ ing or Se@@ di@@ fication of human eye @-@ blood . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is obtained through cold @-@ drying or any other method , which is avoided by a den@@ atur@@ ation of proteins . &quot;
&quot; the dry product can easily dissolve in a water amount , which is equivalent to the fluid level , from which one went out in the production of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentration of so won solution must not be less than 45 g per litre , and the solution must not have the visible sign of ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;
&quot; donations , in which ( using a cream sample ) has been a dangerous content of I@@ so@@ h@@ ha@@ ol@@ ys@@ in or immune hem@@ glut@@ in@@ ous people , are excluded . &quot;
&quot; if plasma is mixed and frozen within 48 hours after the blood withdrawal and frozen , each unit must be detected in a blood of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to activate the harmful effects of bacterial growth products in plasma , blood don@@ ate must not be used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the risk of transmission from I@@ no@@ kul@@ ation@@ she@@ itis , the plasma aber@@ ration may not include more than 12 donations , or apply other methods used to use this danger in comparable manner . &quot;
&quot; one of the fluid level , by which one went out in the manufacture of plasma , corresponding water quantity ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C completely . &quot;
&quot; a given quant@@ um plasma is dissolved in the water amount , which has been produced , which has been produced , corresponds to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; II ) It uses 1 ml solution a sufficient amount of thro@@ mb@@ ine or calcium chloride , such as co@@ ag@@ ulation ; the process may be accelerated at 37 ° . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ level drying process in presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ane , under a pressure of more than 0.@@ 02 mm mercury may not occur in the human dry plasma weight loss of over 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; human dry plasma is in a nitrogen atmosphere , or in air @-@ empty space in a ster@@ il@@ en , closed bottle among all micro@@ organisms , and to store any moisture . it is to protect light and keep at a temperature below 20 C . &quot;
human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions from human plasma proteins are preparations from the protein component originating from the approximately 60 % of the total protein mass of the human whole blood .
&quot; without regard to whether the end product should be flu@@ ent or dry , the preparation according to the addition of a suitable stabili@@ zer must be heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C in the final container to in@@ activate the path@@ ogen of the I@@ no@@ kul@@ ation@@ she@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in preparation of human Alb@@ um@@ in , at least 95 % of the mass of existing proteins must be Alb@@ um@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in both preparations , no more than 10 mg immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin G may be present per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; the final product is dried , it has to contain at least 950 mg of protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; the Group is made from human plasma proteins as a solution , so it must have a total protein concentration between 45 and 50 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; if a solution is made as a solution , a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per litre must be produced . &quot;
&quot; compar@@ ing measurements of viscosity and exercise as well as cent@@ ri@@ fug@@ ing with the Ul@@ tra@@ z@@ cent@@ ri@@ fug@@ al and electro@@ rop@@ ho@@ re@@ se , which are made before and after the heating to the solutions , no signs of a den@@ atured of dissolved proteins may result . &quot;
&quot; after heating on 57 C and six @-@ stage arch@@ ers in a mechanical sh@@ one , the solution must be completely free of visible particles . &quot;
I ) The maturity tests with specific ant@@ is@@ era must show that only human plasma proteins contain only human plasma proteins ;
&quot; the elec@@ trop@@ ho@@ res@@ is represented by joy@@ ous particles under an@@ di@@ visible and suitable conditions , that the protein fraction which is at least 95 % of natural alb@@ um@@ at least 95 % and in preparation from fra@@ ctions from human plasma proteins , at least 85 % of protein mass amounts . &quot;
