the present document is a summary of the European opening report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee on Human@@ ist agents ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the study to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or their treatment , please read the pack@@ et file ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or turn to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to wish further information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for inclusion ( 1 mg / ml ) and an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. com@@ res thinking and talking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or vision of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness in which the patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal up@@ swing ) altern@@ ate with periods of normal tuning . &quot;
&quot; in the past , Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to serious man@@ ic episodes and in the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past . &quot;
&quot; injec@@ tion@@ ing solution is applied for quick control of weak@@ ly rest@@ less@@ ness or behavi@@ oral disorders , if the oral in@@ gest@@ ion of the drug is not possible . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , the solution can be used for induc@@ ing or melting tablets in patients with the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving other medicines at the same time , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adapted . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells among themselves . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably works mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ colon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and d@@ op@@ amine , but in less than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , in order to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , which will reduce the activity of the brain , which will reduce psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , to prevent the symptoms of symptoms , was studied in three studies above until one year . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of injec@@ tion@@ ing solution was compared with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared with sch@@ izophren@@ ia , or similar diseases , compared to placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo that had been re@@ constituted in which the man@@ ic symptoms had been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tion@@ ing solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which compared to increased rest@@ less@@ ness , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the variation of the symptoms of patients underwent a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the company also led trials to investigate , how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution for induc@@ ing stress ( up ) . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with injec@@ tion@@ ing solution patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased ag@@ itation than those who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; when applying for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy dimin@@ ished in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented any more effective than placebo the re@@ frac@@ tional episodes of previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
&quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg cans , also more effective than placebo had reduced the symptoms increased , similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy to intake ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ ordin@@ ate disorders ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vomiting , Nau@@ sea ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vomiting , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , dy@@ nasty ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , hel@@ mets ( sleep disturb@@ ances ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) was at the end that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and from medium @-@ heavy to serious episodes of patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes , and with those of the man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared against the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the result that the advantages of injec@@ tion@@ ing solution in the rapid control of increased rest@@ less@@ ness and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , when oral therapy is not suitable , compared against the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a approval for the distribution of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is used for the treatment of moderate to serious episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder , and for prevention of a new Japanese episode in patients , the predominantly man@@ ic episodes , and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages on a daily dose of 15 mg was not demonstrated , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y amounts to 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mono@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dosage should be considered , when clinical factors are justified ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ d dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that patients with bi@@ polar disorder had no increased risk of risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be applied with caution in patients with known cardi@@ ac diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , heart failure disorders , hypo@@ gly@@ ph@@ ation , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure reduc@@ ers ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated patients and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ itis , should be drawn into consideration , reduce the dose or to break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient symptoms and symptoms evol@@ ve to a m@@ ns , or without a clear fever without any additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , or with conditions that are related to cr@@ amp@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ osis which were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , had an increased death in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study with fi@@ xer dos@@ ing , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ wanted un@@ wanted ret@@ inal events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; there is no precise risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related un@@ wanted events , treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , which allow direct compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ phen@@ otype , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus , or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding a deteri@@ oration of glucose values . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally known for sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar mania due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is observed and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is required when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in combination with alcohol or other centr@@ alised medicines with self @-@ controlled side effects such as seals ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with healthy subjects , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased its AU@@ C by 107 % while the C@@ max remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ing reductions . &quot;
&quot; in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isation , the common use with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 has resulted in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensively . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should be the potential risk for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ors , might have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ing reductions . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be upgraded to the dos@@ ing height before the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
di@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 to be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ ma concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l have no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ ology of morph@@ ine ) and 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to in@@ adequate data conditions for the safety of human beings and due to the reprodu@@ ci@@ ary studies , this medication may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits does not justify the potential risk for the fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the patients should be warned against , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , until they are safe that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative impact on it . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the listed side effects below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; sch@@ izophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a total of smaller incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ kin@@ etic , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ itis , compared to patients who were treated with hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was diagnosed with placebo and 13,@@ 1 % in patients with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with breast cancer treatment . &quot;
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was administered to patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l Treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated with placebo and 15.@@ 7 % for patients with placebo treated patients .
&quot; a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events that occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and above the appearance of the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , include the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ish syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ itis and sei@@ zu@@ res of elderly dem@@ entia , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ intenti@@ onal or ab@@ rupt@@ cy over@@ do@@ si@@ ations were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence . &quot;
&quot; there are no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment ; however , it is unlikely to use hem@@ og@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an overdose when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma attachment . &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder is convey@@ ed over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity for D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ders and for the hist@@ amine recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; at the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily more than 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dos@@ is@@ depend@@ ant reduction of the bonds of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the cleaning . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 of the proportion of the patients who held a response to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measuring scales , defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Depression @-@ Scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , an significantly higher reduction in the decline was reduced by 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients involved , and in which the primary study &apos; weight gain &apos; was , under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( N = 18 or 13 % of valuable patients ) , an increase of at least 5.6 kg ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) in an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with more flexible dosage over 3 weeks with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with a permanent or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo no superior efficacy .
&quot; in two Plac@@ ebo@@ arding and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies of 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a lasting effect that was comparable to placebo or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also pointed out a comparable share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie on such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly over 2 weeks did not reflect on lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherap@@ eutic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission during a stabil@@ isation phase during a stabil@@ isation phase during a stabil@@ isation phase in relation to prevention of a bi@@ polar return , predominantly at prevention of a return in the mania . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes responsible for D@@ eh@@ y@@ dri@@ fication and hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ y by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 cataly@@ sed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 cataly@@ sed . &quot;
the average Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in extensively @-@ intensive met@@ abolic projec@@ tors about CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and for nearly 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ising over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine study sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients were not sexually dependent effects . &quot;
a pop @-@ specific analysis for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics has no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in relation to ethnic origin or effect of smoking at the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic characteristics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and D@@ eh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy subjects .
&quot; a single dose study of subjects with different liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and D@@ eh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not enough to pull the shots on their met@@ abolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety tox@@ ic@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gift , reproduction resistance , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , and can@@ o@@ gens have no special dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or Ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so that they only have limited or no significance for clinical use . &quot;
effects of the effects recorded a dos@@ is@@ depend@@ ant tri@@ ni@@ otic pig@@ ment ( AU@@ C ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 mg / kg / day ) for female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the treatment of sul@@ fate of the hydro@@ xy@@ lic acid in the g@@ all of monkey after repeated oral cancer ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate at the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ z@@ zo@@ l were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the g@@ all of the monkeys , and lie below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects after dos@@ ages have been observed , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold in the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder is convey@@ ed over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; 22 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial , more than 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks during a stabil@@ isation phase during a stabil@@ isation phase during a stabil@@ isation phase during a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , predominantly at prevention of a return in the mania . &quot;

it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder is convey@@ ed over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; 46 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , more than 74 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks during a stabil@@ isation phase during a stabil@@ isation phase during a stabil@@ isation phase during a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , predominantly at prevention of a return in the mania . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day at a dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; patients who have difficulty at the swal@@ lowing of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , you can use the melting tablets , alternatively to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after the onset of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that followed a year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;

man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % was in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder is convey@@ ed over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients involved , and in which the primary study &apos; weight gain &apos; was , under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( N = 18 or 13 % of valuable patients ) , an increase of at least 5.6 kg ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) in an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with a permanent or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , compared to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l as a solution , compared with 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; 99 Fur@@ thermore , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the treatment of sul@@ fate of the hydro@@ xy@@ lic acid in the g@@ all of monkey after repeated oral dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects after dos@@ ages have been observed , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold in the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injec@@ tion@@ ing solution is applied for rapid control of ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ ors in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if a oral therapy is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; once clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tion@@ ing solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
to boost res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize vari@@ ability to minim@@ ize vari@@ ability in the M. del@@ e@@ ide@@ us or deeply in glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle under reverse of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into consideration of the treatment or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a secondary treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is inde@@ xed , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug by using AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tray or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution . &quot;
there are no investigations to the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ oral disorders that were different from sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; in case of a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tion@@ ing solution , the patients should be observed in respect of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure decreases ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
tests on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tion@@ ing solution are not affected for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be applied with caution in patients with known cardi@@ ac diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , heart failure disorders , hypo@@ gly@@ ph@@ ation , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure reduc@@ ers ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that followed a year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ die , sweat and cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ phen@@ otype , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus , or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding a deteri@@ oration of glucose values . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally known for sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar mania due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is observed and an un@@ healthy lifestyle , could result in serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , the intensity of the se@@ Sed@@ ation was greater compared to the long gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study that was used in healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) as one disposable in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ( 2 mg dose ) . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isation , the common use with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 has resulted in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - Prot@@ ective inhibit@@ ors , might have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ing reductions . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be upgraded to the dos@@ ing height before the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular received , the intensity of Sed@@ an was larger compared to the most part of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the listed side effects below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects ( * ) as possible medi@@ cally relevant effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was diagnosed with placebo and 13,@@ 1 % in patients with placebo . &quot;
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was administered to patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated with placebo treated patients with placebo @-@ treated patients .
&quot; a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events that occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and above the appearance of the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , include the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ish syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ itis and sei@@ zu@@ res of elderly dem@@ entia , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ oral disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tion@@ ing solution associated with statistically significant improvements in ag@@ iti@@ vity / behavior . compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and ag@@ it@@ ators and behavi@@ oral disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tion@@ ing solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in relation to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the observed average improvement of the output value on the P@@ AN@@ SS excitement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5,8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population , but a statistical significance could be found due to a reduced patient number . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 of the proportion of the patients who held a response to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % . &quot;
&quot; current values of measuring scales , defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg &apos;s depression scale showed significantly stronger improvement than Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , an significantly higher reduction in the decline was reduced by 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and entered the primary study &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg . &quot;
111 in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics that partly over 2 weeks did not reflect on Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in the therapeutic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study expansion in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission during a stabil@@ isation phase during a stabil@@ isation phase during a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed placebo with regard to prevention of a bi@@ polar return , predominantly at prevention of a return in the mania . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger than AU@@ C after the gift of the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposition was similar to the two formulation . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean period until reaching the maximum plasma size is 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tion@@ ing solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and apes and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated treatment with a systematic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular exposure . &quot;
&quot; in studies on the reprodu@@ ci@@ x@@ icity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns after the maternal exposure , which resulted in 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gift , reproduction tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , and can@@ o@@ gens have no special dangers for humans . &quot;
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or Ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of humans ; so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use .

&quot; in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the treatment of sul@@ fate of the hydro@@ xy@@ lic acid in the g@@ all of monkey after repeated oral cancer ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 times of the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects after dos@@ ages have been observed , which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 times the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study , who participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce adverse events ) .
&quot; overall , in the main study study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on the treatment , versus 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ containing medicines . &quot;
&quot; considering only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the disease and the progression of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , in patients that had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicine was . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it may not be applied in patients , the breast@@ feeding or before the onset of the treatment low neutr@@ ally , in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane , in patients whose first treatment was no longer beats , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medication should not be given to other medicines to decrease side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted Dis@@ ci@@ ence Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited a approval for the distribution of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is missing and not shown for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neutral status of &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy . &quot;
&quot; at sens@@ ory N@@ europ@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment is to cut down to a better level 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose @-@ adap@@ t@@ ations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
&quot; there were no studies involving patients with an adverse effect of kidney function , and there are currently no sufficient data to the recommendation of dose @-@ adap@@ t@@ ations in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for the use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data for infin@@ ity and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ arti@@ tic form@@ ulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have significantly pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be treated , and the patient may not again be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
patients should not be led to a new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles until the neutr@@ ality number rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ar rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with heavy liver function ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly defined cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity was not detected , cardi@@ ac incid@@ ents in the inde@@ xed patient collection are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of the patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diar@@ rhoea , these may be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ o@@ gens and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive resources . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane shouldn &apos;t be used in pregnant or pregnant women , who does not practice an effective contra@@ c@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential . &quot;
&quot; women in common age should be applied during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane , a reliable verification method . &quot;
&quot; male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will unite , during and up to six months after the treatment there is no child to bear . &quot;
&quot; male patients should be advised before the treatment via a sperm level , because of the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane finds the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane may cause side effects like ti@@ redness ( very frequently ) and dizziness ( often ) that can affect the traffic noise and the ability to serve machines .
&quot; following are the most common and most important incid@@ ents of side effects listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients ) and was rapidly reversible and dos@@ is@@ op@@ ia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in table 1 , the effects listed are listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lact@@ ation hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , elevated blood sugar in the blood , elevated blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orus in blood , reduced potassium in blood , reduced potassium in blood . &quot;

rowing 1 The frequency of over@@ flow reactions is calculated based on a definitive in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; as these events have been reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency is possible , and there was no considerable connection with these events . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ k@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli @-@ drug that promotes the merge of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli from the tu@@ b@@ ul@@ ls and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ oly@@ mer .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to a in@@ hibition of normal dynamic Re@@ organization of the mi@@ k@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
&quot; it is known that Alb@@ um@@ into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells were con@@ veys in the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies , that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ ax@@ el promotes the end@@ othel@@ ial cells by the end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transportation through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ receptor is convey@@ ed and due to the alb@@ um@@ ber@@ ant protein protein ( ec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tum@@ ors .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two cat@@ ar@@ dy un@@ blin@@ dness studies and of 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparison study .
&quot; in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in form of in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
this multic@@ entr@@ e study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer patients who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 in the form of sol@@ vent containing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without preced@@ ent ( N = 229 ) .
&quot; when recording in the study , 64 % of patients had an adverse condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ amps . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy , 27 % only had a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metal alloy and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ Line therapy , are below . &quot;
&quot; neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity versus Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who lived at a time during the therapy a peripher@@ al N@@ europ@@ athy grade 3 , evaluated . &quot;
the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound in bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was established in clinical trials .
&quot; the drug exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; 10 After intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took up on multi @-@ phase mode . &quot;
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a wide range of extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ ous distribution and / or turn@@ tables of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of gra@@ x@@ ane with values after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane gift ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection and also the distribution volume was due to Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
&quot; in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue samples , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is reported primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and with two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) . &quot;
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ ters amounted to 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the total total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates an extensive non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ aring . &quot;
&quot; however , only few data are available in the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of these age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic analysis . &quot;
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light light protected over 8 hours .

&quot; &quot; &quot; member states must ensure that the owner of approval for the financial market launch the medical specialist in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail stores with the following information and materials : &quot;
&quot; • Training brochure • A summary of the characteristics of the drug ( technical information ) , labelling and packing line . • With unique image of the correct use of the product accid@@ entally , for transport through patients . &quot;
this means that abor@@ tion is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and also contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference agent &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal bleeding values in which , in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur , if a blood circulation is not possible , and at which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
&quot; treatment with se@@ ams must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor , experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ bleeding , ab@@ se@@ wed in one v@@ ein is in@@ jected . &quot;
injection can also be performed by the patient or the car@@ c@@ un@@ locked lock@@ son as long as they have received appropriate guidance .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ on@@ ite ) in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl on children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are before the treatment to ensure that no iron organ exists , and iron energy should be administered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy alone , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or so that the body does not suff@@ ice sufficiently to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etin . &quot;
Ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etin is also used to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa .
&quot; ab@@ dic@@ ated in administration as injection in a main study of 4@@ 79 patients , compared with kidney problems caused an@@ emia , compared with the reference agent . &quot;
all participating in this study was in@@ jected at least eight weeks before E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been in@@ jected before they were made either on se@@ ams or continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main inde@@ ator for the efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the study period in weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; the company also put the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin is spec@@ kled ab@@ dic@@ ated with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s were raised in the same degree as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who continue to continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0,0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally cause symptoms of an en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ ating mig@@ raine heada@@ ches and confusion . &quot;
&quot; se@@ ams may not be applied to patients that may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa , or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; ab@@ dic@@ ated as injec@@ tions under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) was concluded that the medicine has been established in accordance with the regulations of the European Union of evidence that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for medical specialists in all member states , the company is providing information on the security of the medicine , including information on the security of the medicine . &quot;

&quot; ass@@ essments may vary depending on age , gender , and total disease @-@ load depending on age , gender , and total disease @-@ burden . therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease resistance is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ aries may occasionally be observed in one patient , or under the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ - target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;

&quot; depending on age , gender , and total disease @-@ burden can be different , therefore the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease resistance is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;

&quot; 6 . recommended Dos@@ age amounts to 600 i.e. / kg of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and on the day of the intervention ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 / kg in 10 consecutive days before , on the day of the intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis may be given to the hose of a f@@ ist@@ le needle , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic cooking solution to ensure the hose and ensuring an adequate injection of the drug . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering under the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin to a ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not be ill or another ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin ( see section 4.4 - Ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ ia ) . &quot;

the data for immun@@ ogen@@ icity with sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of patients with a risk for anti @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 . patients with chronic ren@@ al failure should not exceed the lower limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations below section 4.2 .
&quot; in clinical trials , an increased mortality risk and risk of severe cardi@@ ac disease events were observed , if ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ese stim@@ ulated active ingredients ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefits that is due to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ines if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster concentration is increased on the control of blood cells and avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ ined cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or storage @-@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded under section 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
&quot; according to present results , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not even di@@ aly@@ sis , is not accelerated to progression of ren@@ al failure . &quot;
patients with cancer patients should be considered to assess the therapy efficiency of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin @-@ answer ( patients who may need to be trans@@ fun@@ ded ) .
&quot; if the H@@ b ascent is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minim@@ ize the risk for possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 to / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision for use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction among the patients who should take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients that are provided for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic inclusion , if possible , before the beginning of the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia were examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who have under@@ gone a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic surgery , they should have an adequate risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it cannot be excluded that treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa could consist of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative cy@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cul@@ ine events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , for ep@@ et@@ ine , it was not demonstrated to improve the overall survival in tumor patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy declined when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.7 m@@ mol / l )
&quot; ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa should be applied together with c@@ ic@@ lo@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ lo@@ in controls and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine can be adapted to the increasing hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit . &quot;
&quot; in vitro tests on tumor woven , there are no evidence on an interaction between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding domestic differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; thro@@ mb@@ otic membran@@ es , vas@@ cul@@ ous events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ di@@ ales , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , an@@ in@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis , an@@ in@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys , were reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin treatment , so also patients with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine treatment . &quot;
the most common side effect during the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa is an dos@@ is@@ ant increase in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ v@@ ascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ inen .
&quot; ir@@ respective of the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease according to repeated blood don@@ ating disorders to thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetically modified ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa , gly@@ cop@@ ulation and in terms of amino acids and carbohydrates are identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin , which was isolated from the Ur@@ in an@@ dic patients . &quot;
&quot; it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mark@@ s@@ cells , that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa stimul@@ ates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ese and not influenced the leu@@ ka@@ o@@ ese . &quot;

survival and tumor cells were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials .
in the open study there was no difference in the overall survival in the overall survival of human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin treated patients and the control patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to different common mal@@ ign@@ ome consistency , statistically significantly higher mortality than in controls . &quot;
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin treated patients and inspec@@ tions satisfactory .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients that are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ thro@@ po@@ etin , and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clari@@ fied as far as these results indicate the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ thro@@ po@@ etin in tumour patients that were treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value under 13 g / dl , as a few patients were included in the checked data . &quot;
ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life period of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life period of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; according to sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa have much lower than the serum levels that can be achieved by intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain equal , regardless of whether they will be determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study on hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patient who were treated three years with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis was treated opposite the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patient , which were not treated with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa , not increased . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal studies with close to 20 times of application on the application of humans at the recommended week of dose , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa led to dimin@@ ished f@@ low@@ ish body@@ weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , however , for the clinical situation but of uns@@ afe significance . &quot;

200 your doctor regularly determine your values of red blood @-@ color@@ ant ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and to keep your ab@@ dic@@ ated dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood flow formation ( thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic event ) as possible .
&quot; this risk should be treated very carefully from the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa drugs , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events , i.e. , if you already have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events ( e.g. a deep Ven@@ enth@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis or pneum@@ em@@ bo@@ lie ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patients , consider that ab@@ dic@@ ated as a growth factor for blood cells and affect the tumor in certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; when a larger orthop@@ ae@@ dic operation is im@@ min@@ ent , the treatment of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood @-@ color@@ ant ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive any risk of blood flow formation after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you use other medicines / apply or recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ lo@@ in ( means to supp@@ ression the immune system ) during your therapy , your doctor may as@@ sign certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of c@@ ic@@ los@@ in . &quot;

&quot; if a syr@@ inge has been taken out of the fridge and room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause , as well as in men . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a high fra@@ cture risk ( bone break@@ through@@ s ) , including patients who have suffered a slight trau@@ matic hip as at the time ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ cture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and heada@@ ches . &quot;
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
&quot; since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for zom@@ eta was attracted by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of vert@@ eb@@ ies and hip frac@@ tures were examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip fra@@ cture ; the number of frac@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with cra@@ ft@@ ron@@ ate ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) .
&quot; the main inde@@ ator for the efficacy was whether the salary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the serum ( an enzyme , the bone substance builds ) in the blood , decreased or reduced by at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of frac@@ tures were reduced in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis patients ) over a period of three years compared to placebo by 70 % . &quot;
&quot; compared to patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with hip fra@@ cture had 9 % of patients suffering from A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients with placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate or one of the other components .
&quot; as with all mor@@ phosph@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the inhal@@ ation and oste@@ o@@ ec@@ thro@@ sis ( dying from bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for doctors who use A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis as well as similar material for patients , where the medication should be explained and referred to , when they should turn to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ art@@ is Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a approval for the distribution of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a throughout the European Union . &quot;

&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture . &quot;
&quot; the patient inform@@ ation@@ package should be provided , and the following core messages include : • The package of contra@@ diction in pregnancy and lact@@ ating women • Re@@ quired physical activity , of non @-@ smoking and healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • W@@ ann on medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture . &quot;
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended annually .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operational supply of the hip fra@@ cture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
&quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long r@@ low period of patients was observed in patients who have been addressed to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate supply of calcium , according to a minimum of 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , i.e. , or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by the gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended because of limited clinical experiences for this patient group . &quot;
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients are similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 as data are missing for infin@@ ity and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because of these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
&quot; before the treatment of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ ine is treated with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid influ@@ x of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , mit@@ under symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ ine is developing , whose maximum usually occurs during the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate supply of calcium , according to a minimum of 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; canc@@ ers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be weighed in a dental treatment with adequate preventive tooth treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental handles , no data are available whether the treatment of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the ja@@ w area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treatment doctor should be based on the treatment plan for each patient and are based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by the gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; incidence of adverse events reported in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall incidence of predic@@ tions between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions are listed in table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was expressed with ren@@ al dys@@ functions that were expressed as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum ) , and in rare cases considered acute kidney failure . &quot;
the variation of the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured before the administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney function as well as a reduced ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study at oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of the serum Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after the gift was 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ations range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , treated at 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies treated patients . &quot;
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip fra@@ cture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical frac@@ tures , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion process , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the or@@ tho@@ ress Gel@@ eg@@ ei@@ a was primarily associated with cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primary in the pine@@ al area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of reports rel@@ ates to cancer patients after Z@@ ah@@ nex@@ tra@@ ctions or other dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; 7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis occurred in a pine forest with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and placebo treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an overdose , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ ine , can be achieved with the gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium chloride . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once per year has been shown at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either an existing vert@@ eb@@ ox or BM@@ D score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing cycl@@ one .
effects on morph@@ ometric rates of frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after a year the frequency of one or more new vert@@ eb@@ re@@ frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients of 75 years and older had a reduced risk of 60 % compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a proved an equal effect of three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar acid , hips and the dist@@ al radius compared to placebo ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 increase in bone density of the lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.7 % , the total hip um by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology For 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ ines .
a micro@@ computer@@ ized ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed in patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo an increase in the structural bone @-@ volume and preser@@ vation of the structural bone architecture .
bone structure markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples were determined in sub @-@ groups ranging from 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in perio@@ dic intervals during the study period .
treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an intake dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. , oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
the overall survival was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the Horizon R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BM@@ D at the total and weak points at all time points .
&quot; the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment took 24 months in comparison to placebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total , and 4.3 % on scra@@ per cent . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study were 508 men randomised , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % .
&quot; in another study of men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was involved in relation to the percentage of weekly changes in the lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison to the output value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the Kno@@ wer A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly suffering from alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase such as 2,@@ 6@@ fold to 3.@@ 0@@ fold altern@@ ate @-@ specific upper normal value ( intake in the study ) . &quot;
11 . the effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was detected in two six @-@ month compar@@ ative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain strength and pain relief was observed in comparison to A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at after 6 months . &quot;
patients who were classified as a response in the end of the six @-@ month study ( on the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with ri@@ ed@@ ron@@ or treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response could be treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 71 of the patients with a risk @-@ up period of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; one of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data used as dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma level grew rapidly at &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentrations , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; fast @-@ phase disappearance from the large circulation system with half times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long tra@@ jec@@ tory phase with termin@@ ale elimination phase 1 ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above @-@ mentioned ½ -@@ values ) represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the recommended dose is in urine , whereas the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the whole body @-@ Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race , or body@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ concentration against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a reduced Clear@@ ance by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme @-@ met@@ abolic systems is unlikely to met@@ abolic because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abolic , and because it is a weak or no direct and / or mis@@ reversible inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) rel@@ ates the ren@@ al cle@@ aring of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid with the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cancer @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was at 64 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
&quot; this results in fact that a light ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and excessive kidney function up to 35 ml / min does not require dos@@ ing adap@@ tion of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid . &quot;
&quot; there are only restricted data for severe kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ingrad Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , which is not possible for this population . &quot;
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ let@@ tu@@ ously effective intraven@@ ous dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and in rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight . &quot;
&quot; in testing to dogs , single doses ranging from 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic fatigue and chronic tox@@ icity In studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose which equ@@ ates to the 7@@ fold of human therapeutic exposure , relative to AU@@ C , corresponds to AU@@ C , equivalent ) , well toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application with cum@@ ulative ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic effects of other organs , including Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot;
&quot; the most common evidence of studies with repeated application was a prolifer@@ ating primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aphy@@ se of long bones in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an account that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
&quot; in rats , one observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity with doses ranging from 0.2 mg / kg as an outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ normal@@ ities and such skel@@ et@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to rab@@ bits , no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo fet@@ al effects were observed , although the maternal tox@@ icity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of a reduced serum @-@ calcium mirror . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the preparation time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; usually 24 hours at 2 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance that is called Bis@@ phosph@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women who used oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ ine of the bone .
&quot; blood levels of sex hormones , mainly est@@ rogen , which are made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone structure takes place quickly , and new bone material is sub@@ ordin@@ ated , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works by norm@@ alizes the bone structure , thereby creating a normal bone formation and gives strength to the bones . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or under@@ go dental surgery , please inform your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nur@@ ses when you use other medicines / apply or recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you have medicine , from which it is known that they are ashamed of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , along with food and beverages , you worry about to take enough fluid in accordance with the physician &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or the nur@@ ses as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you recently have broken the hips , it is recommended to increase the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operational supply of the hip . &quot;
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the usual dose is 5 mg that is administered by your doctor or the nur@@ ses as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works for a long time , you may need a further dose only after a year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions exactly so that the calcium levels in your blood is not too low after in@@ fusion .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can act longer than a year and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was missed immediately with your doctor or hospital to arrange a new date .
&quot; before the termination of the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Falls , you will take the completion of the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , please come true to your next doctor and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; adverse events in connection with the first in@@ fusion occurs very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; at present , it is un@@ clear whether A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a causes these irregular heartbeat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

&quot; about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , gro@@ wers and angi@@ ogen@@ ous ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or ra@@ ins ) , was reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nur@@ ses when one of the listed side effects you have significantly imp@@ aired or not@@ ing side effects that are not listed in this manual information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for storage and conditions until the application ; usually 24 hours at 2 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture is recommended to increase in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operational supply of the hip fra@@ cture .
&quot; before and after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , the patients must be supplied adequate with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive a di@@ u@@ ret@@ inal therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid influ@@ x of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ ine , whose maximum usually occur within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate supply of calcium , at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , i.e. , or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

&quot; A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is also used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients suffering from obesity ( body mass index - BMI ) of 30 kg / m ² or above , which are overweight ( BMI of 27 kg / m ² ) and beyond . &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies have been carried out on more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was used compared to placebo as supporting the space setting . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the studies on the setting of the room , however , no uniform results showed that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was hard to estimate on this application area . &quot;
what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA ? it is the most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA that were observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tra@@ des . ng The complete listing of associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA reported side @-@ side effects .
&quot; it may not be applied to patients who suffer from an existing heavy depression or to be treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , since it can give the risk of depression and can give thanks to a small minority of patients Su@@ izi@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; caution is provided with the simultaneous application of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means for use in H@@ IV@@ - Inf@@ ection ) , Tel@@ i@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or Cl@@ arith@@ me@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . LN
&quot; the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) termin@@ ates that the efficacy of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was concluded with regard to weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight , &quot;
patients are used in patients suffering from health and non @-@ cosmetic reasons ( by provision of clari@@ fication for patients and physicians ) and around the Ar@@ z
&quot; in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of a obesity ( BMI of 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which are beyond one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ d emia ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 on the basis of absence of data to the efficacy and imm@@ en@@ ity .
&quot; recur@@ sive disorder or mood changes with de@@ press@@ ant symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , Su@@ izi@@ atives for up to 1 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; and in depres@@ sive disturb@@ ances , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied , unless the benefit of treatment in individual case weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to patients who have no apparent risks besides the Adi@@ pos@@ itas , depres@@ sive reactions may occur . &quot;
&quot; members or other nearby persons ) are indicated that it is necessary to monitor the new symptoms of such symptoms and receive immediate medical advice when these symptoms occur . &quot;
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and dis@@ comfort of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not sufficient .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or stroke etc . ) in less than 6 months were closed from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant . l@@ n

&quot; the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of adverse effects in placebo @-@ controlled trials , which were treated for weight reduction and due to accompanying met@@ abolic diseases . &quot;
&quot; if the incidence was statistically significant significantly higher than the corresponding placebo ( for un@@ wanted effects , ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for undes@@ irable effects &lt; 1 % ) . ng On the evaluation of side effects , the following common areas are basically laid : &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0,1 % ) ; very t &quot;
&quot; in a failure study , in which a limited number of persons one @-@ one @-@ limited number of persons were administered up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed . &quot;
the patients had a BMI of 30 kg / m ² or BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ie and / or dy@@ sli@@ d emia .

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR to the public The present document is a summary of the European opening report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the Committee on Human@@ ist agents ( CH@@ MP ) discussed the study concerning recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabe@@ tic medicine ) is not shown . • It can be used together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ ric medicine ( du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , it can not be used with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ d@@ har@@ n@@ stoff or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ d@@ har@@ n@@ osis or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sul@@ fon@@ d@@ har@@ n@@ osis or insulin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s body weight can be enhanced , and the blood sugar level decreases , which makes type 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ one has been studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ ur therapy , in addition it received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured as well as the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood glucose levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the multi @-@ ple@@ a study , the effect of an additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and one sul@@ fon@@ d@@ har@@ n@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional gift of placebo had led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study that was investigated in the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 289 patients , patients who participated in addition to insulin , compared with 0.@@ 69 % to 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took placebo in addition . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were vision problems , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( cold ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to the stimul@@ us ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be applied either in patients who may possibly react sensiti@@ vely to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ( high ket@@ one - acid mirror - in the blood ) . &quot;
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( for the sole use ) is intended to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with which met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Commission Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit to use Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , curved and wear on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also displayed in patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , whose blood sugar with insulin is in@@ adequate and in which met@@ form@@ es is in@@ adequate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compati@@ bilities ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years , no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( i.e. , past heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or eyel@@ ids , especially those with reduced kar@@ di@@ aler reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and eyel@@ ids , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with insulin . &quot;
&quot; a cardiovascular study was conducted with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients below 75 years , with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and an advanced macro@@ vas@@ cul@@ ine condition . &quot;
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports about heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard ) , or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times of the upper limit of the standard , the liver values are soon as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient developed symptoms that point to an evil dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vomiting , harmon@@ ic complaints , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ n , are the liver values . &quot;
the decision to whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should continue to be conducted by the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , dos@@ is@@ depend@@ ant weight gain has been detected , which can stir in fatty deposits and linked in some cases with a fluid . &quot;
as a result of hem@@ og@@ lution treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one therapy ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ atively controlled trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of the increased insulin sensitivity , in patients , the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sulph@@ ur therapy with insulin treatment is obtained , the risk of dos@@ is@@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , under the treatment of Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ din@@ di@@ onen , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported about an occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular e@@ de@@ ma with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular e@@ de@@ men , but for@@ mid@@ able doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular de@@ ma ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic statement should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted events concerning broken bones from randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on &quot;
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , questionna@@ ires were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 questionna@@ ires per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative drug . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient requests a pregnancy or enters it , the treatment is decreasing ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; study to study the inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ actions with medication that are met@@ abolic by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tive , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ a reduc@@ er inhibit@@ or are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with fibro@@ sis ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one to increase the 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induction ) resulted in lowering the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that under the treatment of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the parent , thereby reducing the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fossil growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from available data not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change of the tower and the lens complex of lens , as they also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic drugs . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ended up to three times the upper limit of the standard range as often as placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ d@@ har@@ n@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in an Out@@ come study of patients with existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cul@@ ine disease , the frequency of a severe cardi@@ ac failure was 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ v . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch was rarely reported about heart failure in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , although Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted events concerning broken bones from randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in patients treated with compar@@ ative drugs . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years , there were questionna@@ ires in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative drug . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day after seven days had no symptoms . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to act over an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver and fatty and skel@@ etal cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peri@@ ph@@ ere glu@@ cos@@ ever@@ sion in case of insulin resistance .
&quot; a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de was carried out over two years to examine the time to follow the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar had been random@@ ized to in@@ adequate for insulin treatment with insulin , in spite of insulin treatment , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to patients who have continued to receive insulin . a reduction in the insulin treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials about one year showed a statistically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin quota , compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 weeks investigation on type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies , compared to placebo had a reduction in the total plasma tri@@ glyceri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel as well as low , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; compared to Plaz@@ ebo , there was no statistically significant increase in L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel , while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de reduced values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was not only the sober tri@@ glyceri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ den@@ dial @-@ increased tri@@ glyceri@@ de levels , resulting in both an effect on the tri@@ glyceri@@ de absorption as well as on the Tri@@ glyceri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a cardiovascular study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cul@@ ine disease were random@@ ized to receive either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after an oral use , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is absorbed quickly , with the leading concentrations of the un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one usually takes 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV represents the effectiveness in roughly the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ us ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induction ) or reduces the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after an oral use of radioactive , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans the markers was mainly found in the thread ( 55 % ) and a lower extent in the resin ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the average plasma @-@ elimination gap of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to humans 5 @-@ 6 hours and the total active Met@@ abol@@ ites is 16 @-@ 23 hours .
&quot; the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of the Mother &apos;s substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys agreed after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ at@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ cent@@ ric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that under the treatment of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the parent , thereby reducing the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fossil growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induced in@@ zi@@ den@@ ces of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( for male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epithel@@ ium .
&quot; in a animal model of the family of family aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ din@@ di@@ ons led to an increased incidence of col@@ ont@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , flat and wear on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , questionna@@ ires were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 questionna@@ ires per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative drug . &quot;
&quot; in another study on two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in , each with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were examined . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , there was a statistically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin quota in comparison to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was not only the sober tri@@ glyceri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ den@@ dial elevated tri@@ glyceri@@ de levels , this is an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as on the Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is not able to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; the study was measured according to the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which indicates that blood sugar levels were similar to something like with another human@@ oid . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who possibly react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted to be adapted to the blood sugar together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is to take part of the package ) . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) , concluded that the advantages of acet@@ ph@@ ane with the treatment of diabetes versus the risks of diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S as a approval for the distribution of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , if a fast initi@@ als can be desired together with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
injection no@@ bility must be used under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was in@@ jected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved through an intensive insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning system can be perceived and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any alter@@ ation regarding strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast @-@ acting , bi@@ phase , long @-@ acting insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA versus insulin animal origin ) may result in that a change of dosage is required . &quot;
&quot; if changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in patients a dose is required , this may be necessary for the first dose or months after conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning system of a hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or differently than with its previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; prior to travel that go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals at other times must be taken . &quot;
the doctor therefore must consider possible inter@@ actions in the therapy and seek to ask his patients with different medicines .

&quot; during the first treatment months , tox@@ icity can still occur ; therefore , patients may include at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for prevention of pois@@ oning . &quot;
&quot; the medicine is not recommended for children and in patients who had transpl@@ ant transpl@@ ant , since it was not examined for these groups . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of several Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( pseu@@ medi@@ a@@ emia ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug to treat hypertension ) . &quot;
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg . patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
&quot; the main inde@@ b@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients , the ur@@ inary tract levels in the blood of the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl was . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who received Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily 120 mg of patients receiving a ur@@ inary tract in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients suffering from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarrhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , skin rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular , patients with heart failure in the pre@@ history may possibly affect a increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) was at the end that Aden@@ ur@@ ic could in the blood more effective in the blood more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ sp@@ ik@@ emia in diseases that have already led to certificates of certificates ( including one of the history known or currently present g@@ cht@@ no@@ des and / or a pois@@ oning ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ oses amounts to 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , the efficacy and safety were not completely investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ jected Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents , because there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; organ transpl@@ ant cat@@ ers since there are no experiences in organ transpl@@ ant recei@@ vers , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic heart disease or de@@ compression cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency is not recommended for the treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other hard @-@ acid medicines , it may occur during the treatment of treatment , because through the lowering of the serum acid may initially be mobil@@ ised in the tissues in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so far increasing that it comes to a di@@ ur@@ ination in the urine tract . &quot;
liver disease During clinical trials of phase 3 have been observed slightly ab@@ normal@@ ities of the liver function with hom@@ ux@@ e@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function before the start of the Feb@@ u@@ o@@ static treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was performed no interaction studies in Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line reflection ( a inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ or ) .
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with a rise in Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors are not related to clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at can be applied together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without a dose custom@@ ization for Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at or the same active ingredient is required . &quot;
&quot; in a study with subjects @-@ effective 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily , a medium 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , pointing to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ion of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xide and aluminum hydro@@ xide , which causes a decrease of the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change of AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies can not leave side effects of hom@@ ux@@ e@@ at on pregnancy or health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; animal experimental studies can not include direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful during taxes of a vehicle , serve machines or in practice of dangerous activities , until they can be reason@@ ably secure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC will not affect their performance . &quot;

the risk factors used in these patients were an arter@@ i@@ os@@ cler@@ otic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the hospital history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , which could be reported in connection with the medicine and in all Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at treatment groups , are listed below once . &quot;
diar@@ rhoea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients that are treated simultaneously with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe skin rash or severe over@@ flow reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term renewal studies in open long @-@ term extension studies were treated for 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients with up to 2 years , 57 patients with Feb@@ . 80 mg / 120 mg were treated for up to four years . &quot;
the events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in the phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following events were reported in all hom@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups in total more than once and occurred in patients , the Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data . &quot;
the following events were either not reported in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies in phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , insom@@ nia , hyp@@ es@@ thes@@ ia , skin rash , bur@@ ial in@@ suffici@@ ency , skin rash , bur@@ ial cells , kidney failure , bur@@ ial cells , increase of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decline of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decline of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decline in the number of white blood cells . &quot;

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies in phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ sp@@ ik@@ an@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point in every study was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum concentration of &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) were included in each study .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with a ser@@ um@@ atic value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority relative to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( see Table 2 and figure 1 ) as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) compared to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were sum@@ med up for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg . &quot;
lowering of the serum concentration of &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed during the physician attendance at week 2 and maintain permanently about the whole treatment .
&quot; 509 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily , 10 patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function . the AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function . ( d. h )
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to the percentage of the serum concentration of the serum concentration ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( Bas@@ eline ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; in two years , the data collected from the open extension study of the phase 3 revealed that the lasting reduction of serum levels were reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , that less than 3 % of patients needed a loss of g@@ assing ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a pois@@ oning ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in tox@@ icity size , which at 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the no@@ des up to month 24 . &quot;
&quot; increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) , and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at after administration is easier and multi@@ pl@@ ine doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for t@@ opping doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase of AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tion@@ al increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking a simple or multi@@ pl@@ ywood doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of serum concentration has been observed ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state power distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is located in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma part of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to Alb@@ um@@ in ) , and is reached over the concentration width which reaches doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic consists mainly due to CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ . 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ eters of February , about 49 % of the dose found in urine ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic and their con@@ jug@@ ate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tions about the urine , about 45 % of the dose were found in the chair as un@@ changeable hom@@ ux@@ e@@ ate ( 12 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic and their con@@ jug@@ ate ( 7 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups kidney @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at cannot be changed in proportion to subjects with normal ren@@ al function . &quot;
the mean total @-@ AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at increased by about 1.8 times g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ@@ g / ml in group with heavy kidney function .

age There were no significant changes in terms of AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at or whose metabol@@ ites were observed after taking multi@@ pl@@ al doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger patients .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ ese , impair@@ ment of fertili@@ zation in male rats was statistically significant in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones ( trans@@ itional cellular pap@@ ill@@ oma and carcin@@ omas ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the high @-@ dosed group , with approximately 11 fold of exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ met@@ isation and urine composition and considers clinical use as non @-@ relevant clinical use .
it has been established that Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertili@@ zation and reproduction of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses that were about 4 times the human therapeutic exposure , maternal tox@@ icity , the maternal tox@@ icity , came with lowering the up@@ sur@@ ing performance and a development delay in rats . &quot;
&quot; Ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying out rats with ex@@ positions that were about the 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions that were about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , there was no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are ro@@ ared ) in women after men@@ opause , with which a risk of low vitamin D mirrors . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or intake of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amine supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not take up until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also led a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase of vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , low ( 11 % ) than those who were exclusively written by alone ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the company also submitted data to which the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ one dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE which is exactly the dose recommended for preventing bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are heada@@ ches , pain of the movement apparatus ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ mo@@ ep@@ ts ( diarrhea ) , ul@@ cer ( diarrhea ) , so@@ iled abdom@@ en ( blin@@ ded stomach ) , and aci@@ dic adv@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high sensitivity ( allergy ) against alkal@@ ine , vitamin D3 or one of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in diseases of the feeding tube , in patients suffering from hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who can not stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; Jack@@ me Ltd . a approval for the distribution of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the tear of a bone on the one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vital supplements ) for the day . &quot;
&quot; the following indications have to be precise , to reduce the risk of inde@@ xes and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) : &quot;
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swallowed up after the day of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not che@@ w the tablet or tablet in the mouth , because the patients should not take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. p@@ ep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ations , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al cords , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these heavy metals and required medical assignment ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore consider att@@ enti@@ vely to all signs and symptoms that are to be rejected on possible ös@@ s reactions , and the patients should be pointed out when using symptoms of symp@@ tom@@ atic irrit@@ ation like dy@@ ll@@ s , pain in swal@@ lowing , or retro@@ spective medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe adverse reactions seems to be increased in patients that do not take the medicine correctly and / or , after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that refer to an ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation , continue . &quot;
it is very important that all dos@@ ing instructions on the patient will be used and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during large clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , rarely ( after market introduction ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , some of them have been reported and reported complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the query of bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients who reduces a kie@@ ffer surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ sis of the ja@@ w . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the treatment doctor is crucial for the therapy planning in any patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the patients should rely on that they should take the tablet of the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE dose to take the tablet in the next morning after having noticed their re@@ ig@@ ies .
&quot; they should not take two tablets a day , but taking a tablet per week as originally planned on the planned week@@ day . &quot;
other diseases affecting the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated at the beginning of the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some or@@ ale medicines can affect the absorption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at once they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ one before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of usually prescription drugs , without being clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore not apply during pregnancy or lact@@ ating women .

&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis estu@@ aries , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily ) led to any clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ one ( increase in average in the range of 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;

&quot; according to intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance was not exceeded 200 ml / min . &quot;
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at will not be eliminated in rats out of the aci@@ dic or basic transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is assumed that humans have influenced the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines through this transport systems .

&quot; for vitamin D3 , vitamin D3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy@@ lic in the liver and then in the kidneys to 1.@@ 25 di@@ hydro@@ xy@@ lic D3 , the biolog@@ ically active form , met@@ abolic . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion for the gift of radioactive mark@@ eters of vitamin D3 to healthy volunteers , the average analysis of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 4.9 % , in the threads after 4 days 4.9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics of patients with pre @-@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , which is not stored in the bones , will quickly turn out over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although there are no clinical data about it , yet it is possible to calculate that the elimination of the elimination of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ one can also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;

&quot; the main inde@@ ator of the efficacy was the number of patients suffering from the transpl@@ ant after a treatment duration of a year ( by example , how often a renewed organ transpl@@ ant or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , recent studies of 119 patients with kidney transpl@@ antation and 129 patients with liver transpl@@ ant were performed and examined how Ad@@ vag@@ raf is absorbed by the body as opposed to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transpl@@ antation , or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ op@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes in formulation or of the regime should only be carried out under the eng@@ m@@ asch@@ al control of a medical examination ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in a consequence of a change to alternative formulation , a therapeutic medication monitoring and corresponding dos@@ ages must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us remains unchanged . &quot;
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be based primarily on clinical assessment of de@@ formation and toler@@ ability in individual case and blood @-@ reflection ( see below ) .

careful and repeated inspec@@ tions of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal@@ es are recommended during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation under Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure adequate substance exposure to the immediate response phase .

dose recommendations - liver transpl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis of transpl@@ antation of transpl@@ antation The oral ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf must have a gra@@ ft receiver of twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ raf , so this change in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the whole daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transpl@@ ant After a change@@ over of other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va to Ad@@ vag@@ raf one day the treatment must begin with the proph@@ yla@@ xis for proph@@ yla@@ xis for proph@@ yla@@ xis of transpl@@ antation .
&quot; cardi@@ ac transpl@@ ant in adult patients who are converted to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , is an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day at once a day . &quot;
&quot; other gra@@ fts , although there are no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in lung , pan@@ kre@@ - and dar@@ ed transpl@@ an@@ ted patients in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and at a oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and at a oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dos@@ ages in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood c@@ tal@@ es in the targeted area can be required for patients with severe liver function disorders .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including regular determination of serum ) is recommended to calculate the calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume . &quot;
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ s@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ raf In addition to the conversion from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ oid based on a T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is caution ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the Tal@@ ks in the thorough@@ bred The dose should be based on clinical assessment of de@@ formation and toler@@ ability in the individual case under pressure control of whole blood @-@ t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal@@ es controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal@@ es during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation followed by perio@@ dic controls during the maintenance therapy .
&quot; blood pressure level of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us should also be checked after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ ization , changes of immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy , or with simultaneous application of substances , which may be controlled ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; because Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
&quot; the data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment in most cases is possible , if the valley level should not exceed 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; in clinical practice , the valley level of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us are usually within the range of liver transpl@@ ant@@ ations usually in the range of 5 @-@ 20 ng / ml and ab@@ stain@@ ing and heart transpl@@ an@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance of liver , kidney and heart transpl@@ ants were generally used blood concentrations in the range of 5 @-@ 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including transpl@@ ants , or other side effects , which can occur in a row of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ ride . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes in formulation or regim@@ es should only be carried out under the eng@@ m@@ asch@@ al control of a medical examination ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with transpl@@ antation , which has proven itself against other immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va as therapy @-@ ist@@ ent , there are still no clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; proph@@ yla@@ xis for proph@@ yla@@ xis for adult transpl@@ ants and transpl@@ ants in the kin@@ des@@ age are still no clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation , Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; due to possible inter@@ actions that result in the blood pressure of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a decline in clinical effect of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , the in@@ gest@@ ation of vegetable medicine , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be found , or other plant gains during a treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rhoea , a particularly careful monitoring of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is offered , as the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us blood level has been subjected to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f was a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , chamber or sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore occur under Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart rate , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , liquid value and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted by suitable clothing or use of a sun protection using a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for pre@@ s like heada@@ ches , changed consciousness of consciousness , sei@@ zu@@ res and bl@@ ur@@ red vision should demonstrate a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ raf hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , lact@@ ose , l@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , lact@@ ase deficiency , or glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption is very careful . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of medicines or plant heal@@ ers , known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , thus reducing the blood values of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or reduce blood values . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be able to monitor the CY@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism to monitor and the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintaining the same concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly pronounced interaction was identified with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics , such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , fluor@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and pre @-@ icon@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ eyel@@ id antibiot@@ ic Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us caused by in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
&quot; high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute abor@@ tions , can increase the concentration of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us in the blood or reduce . &quot;
&quot; T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us &apos;s metabolism to the metabolism of other medicines T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us associated with pharmac@@ euticals , which are met@@ abolic due to CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us reduced the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tive , and to increase the hormone levels , is particularly careful with decisions on recep@@ tive actions . &quot;
the results of animal experiments showed that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us potentially decrease the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long their semi @-@ value .
the results of a small number of investigations on transpl@@ ants do not provide a note that under T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us a increased risk of adverse events compared to the course and result of the pregnancy .
&quot; in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns recommended for event@@ ual adverse effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( in particular with its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
it is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ emia of the new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns ) .
the secondary profile of immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va is often assumed for the patient &apos;s illness and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; listed below are listed below the frequency of their frequency : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of available data not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;

cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive leu@@ co@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy and therapy with Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
it was reported over ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ op@@ las@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in conjunction with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us treatment .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding to ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins can be assumed that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; mode of action and the co@@ dynamic effects on molecular level should be con@@ veys the effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the connection of the connection in the cell . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of Sign@@ age transfer through in the T @-@ cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ dg@@ kin @-@ genes .
&quot; T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of B cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ kin@@ en ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and g @-@ interfer@@ on ) and expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;

&quot; kidney transpl@@ antation The efficacy and safety of Ad@@ vag@@ raf and pro@@ gra@@ f was compared with My@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , compared with 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney transpl@@ antation . &quot;

&quot; the incidence of therapy changes after 12 months ( defined as death , transpl@@ antation loss , bi@@ op@@ sy confirmed acute de@@ formation or missing follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the cash group ( N = 212 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ in group ( N = 212 ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment difference was -@@ 3.0 % ( Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f@@ - C@@ ic@@ los@@ s@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % reduction ) for Ad@@ vag@@ raf vs C@@ ic@@ lo@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % ( Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ C@@ ic@@ lo@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % , 5.2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ lo@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the Ad@@ vag@@ raf arm there came 3 ( men ) , in the Pro@@ grave arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in C@@ ic@@ lo@@ in arm 6 ( 3 women , 3 men ) . &quot;
&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , in the form of twice daily pro@@ gra@@ f capsules according to other primary transpl@@ ant@@ ations , has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ op@@ press@@ ant to pancre@@ as , lung and intestinal transpl@@ ant@@ ations . &quot;

&quot; in total , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies revealed the observations in the large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f in liver , kidney and heart transpl@@ ants were used to primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; lung transpl@@ antation In an Inter@@ mediate analysis on a recent test , multi @-@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients who received either T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ lo@@ in as part of 1 : 1 Rand@@ om@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic transpl@@ antation , the bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis of obl@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was also observed in the first year after the transpl@@ antation was less frequently ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;

&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ is had to be converted into T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ us ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute transpl@@ antation , after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) and after 1 year ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transpl@@ ant 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study , the frequency of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis of obl@@ iter@@ - syn@@ dro@@ ms was significantly lower in patients with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us patients . &quot;
&quot; Pan@@ cre@@ ast@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation was performed on 205 patients with a multic@@ entr@@ e study and kidney transpl@@ antation , which received random@@ ized procedures T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ lo@@ in ( n = 102 ) . &quot;
the oral initi@@ ation dose ( per protocol ) from T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reaching the targeted valley level of 8 to 15 ng / ml .
&quot; colo@@ rec@@ tal transpl@@ ant study published in clinical results of a mono@@ centr@@ ic study with oral transpl@@ ant in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 multi @-@ vis@@ cer@@ al transpl@@ ant@@ ations ) under T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one an updated survival rate of 75 % to 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;

&quot; factors such as low hem@@ at@@ rit@@ es and low protein concentrations , which led to an increase in the in@@ compatible group of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , or an increase in treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids are to be responsible for the higher cle@@ aring rates observed after transpl@@ antation . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is almost entirely met@@ alli@@ zed in front of the ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly takes place . &quot;
&quot; at stable patients suffering from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice a day ) at Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( once daily ) at the ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was almost 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;

&quot; patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A is suffering from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ oning problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method that is known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the human body factor VIII .
&quot; adv@@ ices is similar in the European Union &apos;s approved medicines called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , but it is otherwise produced , so the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was investigated by preventing bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood vessels with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; excellent &quot; was evaluated . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ise ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ices must not be applied to patients who may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against human poor factor VIII , mouse , or ham@@ ster protein or other components . &quot;

&quot; during treatment , to control the recommended dose and incidence of injec@@ tions , an appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma controls . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can distinguish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and feature different half times . &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be used doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg of body weight in the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor of VIII plasma will not be reached or if the bleeding is not ruled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be weighed . &quot;
&quot; the submission rate should be set after the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always quanti@@ fied against the pro@@ voc@@ ative activity of factor VIII ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , with the risk within the first 20 exposure stage of the largest one and of genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 extru@@ ders and an@@ am@@ ne@@ tically known inc@@ ite development , it was observed after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the repet@@ ition of ( hard@@ tit@@ els ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurr@@ ence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences yet , during pregnancy and lact@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s greatest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which were all in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;

&quot; in addition , there was no one of the 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavier to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) following exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients with factor VIII . &quot;
the immune response of patients on traces of contam@@ inated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend , as well as an ongoing peak of anti@@ body @-@ mirror against anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms pointing to an allergic reaction or hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity . &quot;

&quot; based on the approval of the approval available , CH@@ MP has continued to have the benefit risk ass@@ essments as positive , but in consideration that safety profile must be closely monitored in the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP grants to the basis of the security filter of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes an application of P@@ SU@@ Rs every 6 months , decided that the approval holder should apply for another 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited was officially distributed to the Committee on Human@@ ist agents ( CH@@ MP ) that the company reli@@ es its application for marketing of adv@@ ances to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , the breast , the brain , the bones , or the wheat parts ( tissues , which connects the other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and bases ) . &quot;
&quot; this is a type of virus , which was genetically modified , that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; with the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which has been changed so that there is no copies of itself , and thus no infections can trigger in humans . &quot;
adv@@ ances would have been in@@ jected directly into the tum@@ ors and to enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defect in the human body of the p@@ 53 gene , normally contributes to the recovery of dam@@ aging DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; in the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company put data from a study with a patient who joined the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub@@ assemblies , in the bones and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP asked the questions of the company applied upon him , still some questions were uncertain . &quot;
&quot; based on the testing of initially submitted documents , CH@@ MP grants 120 a list of questions which will be sent to the company . &quot;
the CH@@ MP opinion has not been demonstrated that injection of adv@@ ances in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors are advantages for patients .
&quot; the committee had further concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ance can be made in reliable ways and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient to be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the company does not consider the CH@@ MP regarding whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ onate &quot; programs with adv@@ ances in advance . &quot;
&quot; altered mode of material , means that the tablets are so combined that one of the effective components immediately and the other will be released slowly over a few hours . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever , caused by an allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nose s@@ mu@@ til@@ ting ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and teenagers over 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze twice daily is a tablet which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose s@@ mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ assed . &quot;
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may cause the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main measurements were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms that were reported by the patient before the onset of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and reviewed with a standard scale , how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients who received aer@@ in@@ ers income , compared with a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % of patients who had pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin alone . &quot;
&quot; when only the swelling of the nose s@@ mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ aze showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who were Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ ometer ( heart hunt ) , oral dry , dizziness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rowing of appetite ) , phar@@ yn@@ g@@ itis ( loss of appetite ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin or one of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ge active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for the treatment of aller@@ gies ) are not used . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze cannot also be applied to patients who suffer from a narrow eye pressure ) , ur@@ inary or vessel disease including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hypertension ) , or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the unit SP Europe a permission to manage Aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , it is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without them to cr@@ ush or che@@ w ) . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to absence and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) for children under 12 years of age .
&quot; the duration of application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after separation of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin can take away . &quot;
&quot; following the decline of swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory system , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a Mon@@ o@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ emulsi@@ fier , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , erg@@ ot@@ amine , di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other Dec@@ on@@ gest@@ iv@@ a , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ drin , oxy@@ gen@@ az@@ olin , al@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collection and do not submit the data to address appropriate recommendations .
safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and does not submit the data to address appropriate recommendations .
&quot; patients must be informed that the treatment at the occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ ton@@ ia or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ cardi@@ ac or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea , or contamination of other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headache , or rein@@ forcement of heada@@ ches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; treatment of patients with patient groups will be careful : • patients with heart rhyth@@ mia • patients with hypertension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes mell@@ itus , bladder infections or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze is at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ amine faced positive reactions to indicators for skin reaction or reduce in its extent . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of plasma concentration were observed . &quot;
&quot; at the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences were detected between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the placebo treated patients , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , was not identified yet , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines cannot be excluded . &quot;
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhibit@@ ing in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 non @-@ vitro and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate still an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
&quot; the in@@ sist@@ ence of the use of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not assured , experience gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison to the frequency of normal population . &quot;
&quot; due to reproductive studies in animals not always transferred to humans , and due to vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ k@@ ic properties of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should however be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases it can come to a drow@@ sin@@ ess that can lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic noise or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( consolidation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , heart @-@ circulation coll@@ agen ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( insom@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ kking , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , values of mic@@ rot@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle ten@@ sions , eu@@ ph@@ oria , excitement , nausea , vomiting , cor@@ di@@ al pain , dizziness , T@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ y , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , hyper@@ ton@@ ia , or hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot;
&quot; a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is especially likely in children , as well as A@@ trop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( oral dry , P@@ up@@ ill@@ enst@@ ar@@ re and - Dil@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ thermal and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the inhibit@@ ing of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ stic cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en and in@@ hibition of expression of the expression of the expression of the expression P @-@ sel@@ ess in end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single @-@ dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the rein@@ forcement of sub@@ jective beats or tasks that are connected to flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg there was no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine in the recommended dosage may cause further sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ cardi@@ ac or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in the age of 12 and 78 , 1,@@ 248 patients participated in seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets received . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine @-@ agon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined using the total co@@ res for the symp@@ tom@@ atic ( except nose s@@ mu@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets in regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in relation to gender , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; within a single dose , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was reached in day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi @-@ dos@@ cope study , which was performed using the formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects , has been found that four subjects were des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine po@@ or@@ ly variety . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine according to the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ i was an exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety tox@@ ic@@ ology , for tox@@ icity at repeated gift , for Gen@@ o@@ ox@@ icity and the reproductive health elast@@ icity can recognize the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin however no special dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater tox@@ icity as their individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the contents of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin . &quot;
the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine studies was the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in oral gift to rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml Sir@@ up bz@@ w . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , and two studies of patients who had also asthma ) . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of quad@@ ru@@ pul@@ sion , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body describes the sy@@ rup , solution to insert and melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and application for children un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us became an average decrease in symp@@ tom scores ( symp@@ tom scores ) by 25 to 26 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % involving patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ gen@@ aria , the decrease of symptoms after six weeks was 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission declared a approval for the distribution of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical studies on the efficacy of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine for young people aged 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be termin@@ ated accordingly to the previous disease and can be termin@@ ated according to the sound of symptoms and again .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the everyday life .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets which were administered in addition to the Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ phar@@ ological study , the effective intake of alcohol is not intensi@@ fied ( see under Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should however be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases it can come to drow@@ sin@@ ess that can lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic noise or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us as patient who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events that were reported more frequently than placebo was ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , oral dry ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common secondary effect of heada@@ ches , had been treated at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine and were treated with placebo in 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , administered at up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both inhibit@@ ing of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human ma@@ stic cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en and in@@ hibition of expression of the expression of the expression of the expression of the expression of end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , administered in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , was not statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ phar@@ ological study , administered at Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in an individual dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the rein@@ forcement of sub@@ jective beats or tasks that are connected to flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the absence of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , tr@@ al flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
perme@@ ating allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as on the basis of the total Commander of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us decreased effectively by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated , representing further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology of e@@ ti@@ ology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; as the hist@@ amine @-@ off of an urs@@ or factor is expected in all ur@@ tic diseases , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also expected to improve the symptoms of ur@@ tic@@ aria to improve symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the amount of squares at the end of the first dose . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of the patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ amine re@@ acted from the study . &quot;
improvement in youth unemployment by more than 50 % was treated at 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disturb@@ ance of sleep and wa@@ its significantly as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluation of this variables .
&quot; in a Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , which was comparable to patients with the overall seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis population , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
there are no indicator points for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , was not identified yet , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded . &quot;
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhibit@@ ing in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate still an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
&quot; in a single dos@@ is@@ case study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) do not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the clinical studies carried out by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , at a compar@@ ative degree of exposition of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quant@@ it@@ ative differences regarding the tox@@ icity of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and from Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety tox@@ ic@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gift , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the reproductive health elast@@ icity can recognize the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin no particular dangers for humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the wor@@ sen@@ ing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see under Section 4.4 ) and that no data are present which support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es should play a role in the diagnosis , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin studies . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of met@@ abolic des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is restricted and experienced a higher substance of substance ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children aged between 2 and 11 , which is fully met@@ abolic , is identical to children suffering from normal met@@ abolic . &quot;
this medicine contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose g@@ act@@ ose absorption or a suc@@ rose in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medication should not be taken . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets which were administered in addition to the Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ ological study NSC 631570 was not intensi@@ fied when taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the placebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , administered at up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years old , who came for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin who are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults on the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine used in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ phar@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) has been applied for over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; at a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials have no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , it came neither with the simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ion of alcohol , neither to a gain of alcohol induced power damage even to an increase of drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the lens of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , it@@ ching and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , tr@@ al flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as using the total co@@ res of the cargo of the quality of the quality of the quality of rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets decreased effectively by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the amount of squares at the end of the first dose . &quot;
&quot; the prevalence of this met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger than black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than for Caucas@@ ians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic multi @-@ dose study involving sy@@ rup formation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis .
&quot; after 3 to 6 hours , the load ( AU@@ C ) was higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max . 3 to 4 times higher with termin@@ ale half @-@ up time of approximately 120 hours . &quot;
there are no reference points for clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5- 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In different single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were similar in the recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , was not identified yet , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines cannot be excluded . &quot;

&quot; immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ats will be removed without damage . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets which were additionally used in the Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , which were used up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examination , display signs and EC@@ G intervals . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used daily at a dose of up to 20 mg daily for more than 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ phar@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) has been applied for over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;

&quot; the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children aged between 2 and 11 , which is fully met@@ abolic , is identical to children suffering from normal met@@ abolic . &quot;
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose g@@ act@@ ose absorption or a suc@@ rose in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medication should not be taken . &quot;
overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; at infants between 6 and 23 months , most common adverse events were reported to be more common than placebo , diar@@ rhoea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and insom@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , at one single @-@ one dose of 2.5 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin solution , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. was officially distributed to the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company reli@@ es its application for the distribution of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect the flu which caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza @-@ A virus .
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a strain of influenza , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ dem@@ ie breaks out when a new strain of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus appears to spread easily by man because people still have no immun@@ ity ( protection ) against it .
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the parts of the influenza virus as &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and is antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is able to form a quick antibody in contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus . &quot;
&quot; afterwards the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , the human body recognis@@ es ) separated , pur@@ ified , and used as an integral part of the vaccine . &quot;
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; thereby , the scope of clinical data base for the evaluation of the security of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; if you need to participate in a clinical test and need more information about your treatment , please contact your treated doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to wish further information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , causing human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which caused the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ h@@ are is available as a solution , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , since the safety of this combination was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be classified if the doctor has checked , which has taken an an@@ tivir@@ al medicine of the patient before , and the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood has judged that the virus will talk to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice a day , which together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines . &quot;
&quot; for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is aimed at body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , as@@ par@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS is not cure , however , the damage of the immune system and so that the development of AIDS connected infections and diseases can also be re@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which had previously been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; with low do@@ si@@ dered Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines A@@ gener@@ ase has been taken at 206 adults , which previously taken previously prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , compared with other prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; main inde@@ b@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ proven concentrations of HIV at the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) , or the change of viral load after treatment . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks in studies with patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ or , more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than placebo , but as@@ par@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also dimin@@ ished the viral load , but with the children who had previously treated with Prot@@ ective inhibit@@ ors , only very few on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ants were treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines A@@ gener@@ ase the viral load after 16 @-@ weeks treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or : &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ or , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks than in the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of as@@ par@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhoea ( diarrhea ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , skin rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients that may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r , or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a herbal preparation for the treatment of depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals , which are just like as@@ par@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines against HIV , patients who have A@@ gener@@ ase , the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ o@@ ec@@ thro@@ sis ( dying from bone tissue ) or a immune activ@@ ating syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ ating immune system ) . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) termin@@ ates that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines prescribed by using prot@@ eas@@ ants prescribed HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years versus the risks . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee set out that the benefits of ap@@ hi@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should not be demonstrated . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a approval for the distribution of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are supposed to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic p@@ adding of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r should be taken into consideration of the individual viral resist@@ or and treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r as a solution for induc@@ ing is 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to intake in a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r twice a day , together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) must be applied , higher doses have to be applied to ash@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for ax@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r / kg of body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic , efficacy and safety of as@@ par@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ants were not examined at children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the absence of data for infin@@ ity and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ zo@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of patients with mild or moderate liver function should be done with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with pharmac@@ euticals , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; vegetable preparations , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may contain due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a healing of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ather@@ ase prevents the risk of transmission from HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , increased risk of severe liver disease with potentially fatal course . &quot;
&quot; for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this drug . &quot;
patients with existing reduced liver function including chronic hepatitis treatments show an increased incidence of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous application of ap@@ hi@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with fluor@@ tic@@ ason or other Glu@@ cop@@ cor@@ ti@@ ids , which can be replaced on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended that the potential benefit of a treatment of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the tri@@ bal function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the material changes of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ reduc@@ er inhibit@@ or at@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , it is not recommended for the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma concentration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abolic inter@@ actions with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive may be changed , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium agents , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
because of the potential risk of tox@@ icity due to the high Prop@@ yl@@ glyco@@ col@@ oring of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution with certain other patient groups .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be placed on duration 5 , when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ or , was reported on the occurr@@ ence of diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an Ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes mell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy medication needed to be associated with the development of a diabetes mell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug addic@@ ts factors such as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated with met@@ abolic disorders , is associated . &quot;
&quot; in case of h@@ äm@@ op@@ hil@@ en patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
&quot; at the time of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ inflammatory effect on asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections who leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi @-@ fac@@ tual e@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with medicines whose active ingredients are predominantly connected to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r causing a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to lead to a resistance development .
&quot; when attemp@@ ting to im@@ pose the lower plasma level due to a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very often un@@ wanted effects on the liver . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r can be dri@@ fted through the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient is already occupied by the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ pl@@ av@@ irus mirrors and if possible , check the viral load and apply the cur@@ rant . &quot;
&quot; a dose custom@@ ization for one of the drug is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fav@@ ir@@ ence below ) . &quot;
508 % increase if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the effectiveness and imm@@ en@@ ity of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as . &quot;
in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the c@@ min values of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) have been reached , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a nar@@ rowing monitoring is recommended because the effectiveness and imm@@ en@@ ity of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; it has no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination , but due to the ant@@ acid component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is not required . &quot;
treatment with rub@@ bing in combination with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ or would be dri@@ fted .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ eas@@ iness inhibit@@ or and existing limited data may susp@@ ect that ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin may reduce the serum concentration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is required because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines are applied together , caution is required ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , because a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to be difficult . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous gift of am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in by 193 % , thereby resulting in a rise in associated side effects . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in along with A@@ gener@@ ase is required to reduce the dose of rift in at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies with ather@@ ase in combination with Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma @-@ level of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ m@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole to the 2,@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value , which was observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly to inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients should therefore be connected to toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs , when they are used in combination with ash@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da could not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can result in res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va , known as enzymes , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ on can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of the plasma concentration of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium @-@ can@@ al@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , fle@@ d@@ pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , thereby the activity and tox@@ icity of this drug may be increased . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ion , the plasma concentration can considerably increase , and with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , increase vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily , together with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , the fluor@@ inated K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ co@@ con@@ co@@ ids it is because the potential benefit of a treatment of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ i@@ der effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a reduc@@ er inhibit@@ or , such as Lov@@ int@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which varies strongly from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , characterized by the plasma aspect at the simultaneous administration of A@@ generic ase . &quot;
&quot; since Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ing increases of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a reduc@@ er inhibit@@ or to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this drug may not be recommended with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as well as stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us may be increased with the same gift of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ liz@@ ase may not be applied together with oral sl@@ an@@ ised Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while on the simultaneous application of as@@ par@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is required . &quot;
&quot; data for the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eas@@ ing inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am , around 3 to 4 times . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered along with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium agents , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of its low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation may be given , such as the Am@@ det@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose is administered when Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; during the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive tiv@@ a is not predic@@ table , therefore , alternative methods for contra@@ c@@ eption is recommended . &quot;
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the same gift of as@@ par@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied only after a careful breakdown of the potential for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk activ@@ ating rats , am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r has survived in breast milk . &quot;
&quot; reproduction of the rats that was given to the end of the stag@@ ation in the u@@ terus until the end of the breast@@ feeding of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight during the breast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; the further development of income , including fermentation and reproductive ability , was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r to the parent . &quot;
the in@@ dem@@ nity of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the adverse events associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly up to moderate , occurred early and rarely carried out to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether it is related to the intake of as@@ par@@ ase or another at the same time as HIV treatment applied , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the mentioned side effects are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or not treated patients 1200 mg of acres twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , defined by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication as well as in the treatment of applied laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed below . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of oils and fa@@ al fat tissue , prolifer@@ ated intra@@ ocular and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ vi@@ k@@ al fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally not prescribed persons who were treated with Am@@ iv@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over a medium length of 36 weeks , only a case ( stal@@ ks ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , in 245 N@@ RT@@ I@@ - pre @-@ treated patients ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is above a medium length of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin rash were usually mild to moderately pronounced , ery@@ them@@ atic or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ sic natural , with or without it@@ ching and occurred within two weeks , without having to be broken off the treatment with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease , or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily together with low do@@ si@@ dered Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , species and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; an exception of the tri@@ glyceri@@ de and CP@@ K values treated with low do@@ si@@ dered Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were very frequent . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an overdose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ tox@@ icity ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary support for supporting action . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and prevents the process of viral g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ ari@@ zation , with the consequence of a formation not infectious diseases . &quot;
&quot; the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ ast@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al hem@@ at@@ ocy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells .
the connection between activity of the activity of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans are not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , such as with other kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r ble@@ oo@@ ster@@ ling treatments have only rarely been observed . &quot;
&quot; at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients that have received 700@@ mg Fos@@ m@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred until week 48 , where 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ic could be examined . &quot;
&quot; gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of 13 of 14 children , where a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure was included within the 59 , with prot@@ eas@@ ants could not be treated in treated patients , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ I / L , I@@ 47@@ I / L / T / V , Q@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2a , V@@ 8@@ 2a , V@@ 8@@ 2a , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) and patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred about 96 weeks in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure :
&quot; for gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing systems , Gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ative systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insulation . &quot;
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 8@@ 2a / C / M / M / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G /
&quot; conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations samples can modify changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to attract the current inter@@ pret@@ ative systems to analyze results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests @-@ based analyses , clin@@ ically vali@@ ant inter@@ pret@@ ative systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insulation . &quot;
firms which drive diagnostic tests tests have clin@@ ically developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ off@@ s ( separ@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of a resistance tests .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross@@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data to cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ors , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally untreated patients , where a Fos@@ amp@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ ab@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; vice versa , Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ or resistant insulation at ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; early sl@@ ump is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders , which can affect the following treatment . &quot;
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a randomised open study ( standard of care , SO@@ C twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ o@@ sid@@ oro analogue ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with minimal squ@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity opposite A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I , were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in relation to the time @-@ adjusted average changes from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks at a non @-@ lower shaft of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of un@@ finished co@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials , with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 with PI were pre @-@ treated . &quot;
&quot; in the studies A@@ bi@@ ase solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low do@@ si@@ ated Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase of the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data should be considered to be considered in the treatment of treatment with PI , to be considered to be an expected benefit of &quot; un@@ finished &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after oral dos@@ ing , the medium length ( max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
508 % increase if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered along with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decline in AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r 12 hours to Dos@@ age ( C@@ 12 ) .
&quot; therefore the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg , at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be tied to a large distribution volume as well as an im@@ pregn@@ able penetration of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r from blood circulation into the tissue . &quot;
&quot; this change leads to a decrease of the overall concentration in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of non @-@ bound am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active ingredient during the dos@@ ing department in the Ste@@ ady State is dependent on the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines must be treated with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ ing or in@@ hib@@ its or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 which are given to caution simultaneously ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r exposure , such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ availability than of the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ base .
&quot; the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , therefore the impact of kidney function is likely to be low on the elimination of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these treatment schem@@ atics are comparable to am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r plasma nerve organs , which can be achieved on healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats came in case of male animals of o@@ cell cellular Aden@@ ome at doses of 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the o@@ cellular aden@@ omas and Kar@@ zin@@ ome have not yet been glorified and the relevance of this observ@@ able effects for people is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , little evidence for the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings were used in clinical studies as well as from clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kern@@ test in rats and chromosome tests performed on human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was not even gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; the tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; previously , in clinical trials , no significant liver tox@@ icity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase even after the end of treatment . &quot;
&quot; tox@@ icity in young people , who were treated at a age of 4 days , showed both a high mortality in the control and treated with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r animals . &quot;
&quot; with systemic Plas@@ ma@@ Ex@@ pos@@ ure , which was significantly higher ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus and lower skel@@ etal changes were observed . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) must be applied , higher doses have to be applied to ash@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for ax@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r / kg of body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of patients with weak or light liver function should be done with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;

&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be set on duration 27 , when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ tive factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated with met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r causing a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to lead to a resistance development .
508 % increase if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the c@@ min values of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) have been reached , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a nar@@ rowing monitoring is recommended because the effectiveness and imm@@ en@@ ity of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with rub@@ bing in combination with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ or would be dri@@ fted .
&quot; if these medicines are applied together , caution is required ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , because a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to be difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in along with A@@ gener@@ ase is required to reduce the dose of rift in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium @-@ can@@ al@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , fle@@ d@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , thereby the activity and tox@@ icity of this drug may be increased . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily , together with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , the fluor@@ inated K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; during the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of No@@ re@@ thin@@ dron ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied only after a careful breakdown of the potential for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; reproduction of the rats that was given to the end of the stag@@ ation in the u@@ terus until the end of the breast@@ feeding of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in body weight during the breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the in@@ dem@@ nity of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in the case of an overdose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ tox@@ icity ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary support for supporting action . &quot;
&quot; the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ ast@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al hem@@ at@@ ocy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µg / ml ) .
&quot; vice versa , Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ or resistant insulation at ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the treatment optim@@ isation should be considered to be considered by PI for the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ finished &quot; ag@@ ro@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of non @-@ bound am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active ingredient during the dos@@ ing department in the Ste@@ ady State is dependent on the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines must be treated with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ ing or in@@ hib@@ its or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 which are given to caution simultaneously ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al cle@@ aring of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore the impact of kidney function is likely to be low on the elimination of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats came in case of male animals of o@@ cell cellular Aden@@ ome at doses of 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily use of 1200 mg of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the o@@ zel@@ ul@@ ary Aden@@ ome and Kar@@ zin@@ ome have not yet been cleared and the relevance of this observ@@ able effects for people is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , from the present position data on humans , both from clinical studies as well as from therapeutic use , however , little hin@@ ts for the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse test tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kern@@ test in rats and chromosome tests performed on human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; tox@@ icity in young people , who were treated at a age of 4 days , showed both a high mortality in the control and treated with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r animals . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that in Jung@@ es the metabolism is not fully mature , so that Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;

the bio@@ availability of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r as a solution for induc@@ ing is 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to intake in a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , when taking the solution to stop ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for ash@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r / kg of body@@ weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2800 mg of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there must be no dose recommendation for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for induc@@ ing and low do@@ si@@ dered Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may be avoided in these patients . &quot;
&quot; although a dose is not necessary for Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r not necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated for patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reactions than a result of the high prop@@ ane glyco@@ col@@ oring content , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated for infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration can lead to a competent inhibit@@ ing of this drug and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z .

the in@@ dem@@ nity of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether it is related to the intake of as@@ par@@ ase or another at the same time as HIV treatment applied , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , such as with other kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r ble@@ oo@@ ster@@ ling treatments have only rarely been observed . &quot;

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has been so long continued until all visible feet have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ an@@ al area or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment of treatment should be weighed if intensive local inflammation arise ( see section 4.4 ) or if a infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if the follow @-@ up examinations ranged from 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions should only be completely healed , a different therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is lifted up into a thin layer and to rub in the pur@@ ified , with f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts infected skin areas , until the cream is completely covered . &quot;
it should be associated with these patients a reduction in the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and associated with a possible loss of immune disease .
it should be associated with these patients a variation between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk @-@ offensive treatment or count @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction .

&quot; when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation were observed , which required a treatment required and / or have led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the output of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty while maintaining a emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of affected area required . &quot;
for use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following the treatment with other cut@@ aneous sub@@ cut@@ aneously in the treatment of external feeding in the genital and peri@@ an@@ al@@ zone have no clinical experiences yet .
&quot; limited data suggest an increased rate of f@@ eig@@ war@@ nings reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a smaller effectiveness in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips , or the hair of hair was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; local hood transactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions take back in general during therapy , or the reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break of several days may be made . &quot;
&quot; after the treatment of treatment , the clinical outcome of the therapy can be evaluated approximately 12 weeks after the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; there are currently no data about long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment are available , other suitable therapy forms should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , there are no clinical experiences before , therefore the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicate that during large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a less@@ er probability of contact to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been studied for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses in eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears , or at the lip@@ en@@ cer within the lip@@ en@@ ots . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses to anatom@@ ical areas outside the facial and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the acute ker@@ at@@ osis on the under@@ arms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore , such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local back@@ tre@@ aties frequently occur , but these reactions take normally take back during therapy to intensity or go back after the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause large un@@ eas@@ iness , or are very strong , the treatment can be suspended for several days . &quot;
&quot; out of the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 acts of les@@ ions are affected by less than 8 les@@ ions in patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies have no direct or indirect adverse effects on the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ öt@@ ale development , see the binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ time top@@ ical application , quanti@@ fi@@ able serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) can be achieved , no recommendation for use during the breast@@ feeding can be given . &quot;
the most often hur@@ ried and possibly possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in relation to three @-@ weeks treatment were local reactions to the place of treatment of f@@ eig@@ war@@ ples ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) .
&quot; to the most frequently reported and possibly as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection , complaints related to the application location with a frequency of 28,@@ 1 % . &quot;
the Bas@@ ali@@ om &apos;s treated from 185 to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated bas@@ ali@@ om patients from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in these studies were a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) . &quot;
the adverse events that were given by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
&quot; according to investig@@ ating the assessment of clinical signs , this placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials frequently shows a three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion / leaf@@ lets ( 23 % ) and oil ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the assessment plan of the clinical signs , this study shows that in these studies with five times a positive treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very frequently to severe ery@@ thema migrans ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and a severe abras@@ ion and c@@ ens@@ ation ( 19 % ) occurred . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies on the investigation of the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the accid@@ ental unique up@@ sur@@ ge of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gies and fever . &quot;
clin@@ ically serious side effects that occurred after several oral dos@@ ages of &gt; 200 mg taken in hyp@@ ot@@ onia that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
&quot; according to the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , increasing systemic concentrations of the Alpha@@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine were detected . &quot;
&quot; in 3 appro@@ vals relevant Phase 3 efficacy studies , the effectiveness in relation to a complete release of the f@@ eig@@ n treatment was superior to placebo with an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo . &quot;
&quot; at 60 % of the total of 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment , the F@@ eig@@ war@@ n had completely healed ; this was 20 % of the 105 patients with placebo treated patients ( 95 % CI ) . &quot;
a complete healing was achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients compared to 5 % of 161 treated with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od at five times a week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind and placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
&quot; the targets were hist@@ ologically , single primary super@@ specific bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm . &quot;
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years indicate that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically estimated and this also remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has three weeks of three weeks in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treated free period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ tro@@ phic acc@@ es within a related 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area than on the hair@@ less scal@@ p , or in the face . &quot;
the end @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ rence of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical trial after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved declar@@ ations , brie@@ fing , brie@@ fing and super@@ st@@ iti@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients generally not up and therefore were not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was analyzed in four randomised , double @-@ blind @-@ controlled trials involving children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies where doses of doses are not shown ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively ) .
a minimum systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream caused by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three weeks of weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0,1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ time half @-@ time period was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time period following the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates an extended re@@ tention of the drug using the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low and comparable to MC @-@ induced skin of patients at the age of 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ specific bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study of reducing tox@@ icity in the rat @-@ plate , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased Mil@@ z weight ; a study found no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice at least three days a week did not induced tum@@ ors at the application .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and not mut@@ tered , is a risk for humans due to the systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice , treated with the real free cream , sooner and in greater number than in the control group with low U@@ VR control . &quot;
&quot; it can harm other people , even if these same symptoms have you significantly imp@@ aired , or notice any side effects that are not specified in this manual information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
● F@@ eig@@ war@@ ples ( Con@@ d@@ yl@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed to the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( gender organs ) and the anus ( after ) the superf@@ icial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a commonly found and slow growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body .
&quot; if it remains un@@ treated , it can lead to un@@ itions , especially in the face - therefore a screening detection and treatment is important . &quot;
&quot; Akt@@ can ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people , who were exposed to people during their previous life . &quot;

&quot; the study was primarily investigated by the drug , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( by using its effect in terms of reducing the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the g@@ ag concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion area . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied strongly ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) , not used . &quot;
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be updated every year to review and update this summary . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturers of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients receiving al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , with regard to reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies . &quot;
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a approval for the distribution of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ Mamm@@ al cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ blast , ov@@ ary of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is inde@@ xed to the long @-@ term enzymes in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ ch ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ tin I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor that possesses experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited met@@ abolic diseases .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased , if the patient carries it , every 15 minutes in single steps increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
&quot; with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , defined as any other side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or by the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , these patients should continue to be supervised , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only occur in an adequate clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ ational devices are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected , usually within 3 months from the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , must be treated with caution by al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; since little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , must be careful due to the theore@@ tically elevated risk response after a dis@@ ruption of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti @-@ py@@ ards ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of a light or medium @-@ consuming reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or reducing the incidence of in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced to mention a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction has occurred .

&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cellular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies are not shown on direct or indirect imp@@ lications of pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase on the breast milk , is recommended to not feed during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
the adverse events in clinical trials were classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) were observed .
undes@@ irable medicines in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me who were observed during the period of 5 years or older at a total of 45 patients with a total treatment duration of up to 4 years are frequently performed ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , there were also severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , breath@@ s and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me who were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients , with greater severe decline form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , reported in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; most patients hosp@@ itali@@ zed within 3 months after the onset of treatment to a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version , with a severe failure form usually came to a Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature departure from the study ) were det@@ ectable in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients with which it never came to Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version . &quot;
patients with lack of low @-@ body levels rejected a robust reduction in the g@@ ag mirror in the har@@ n while in patients with high @-@ antibodies a variable reduction of g@@ ag in the har@@ n was observed .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) demonstrated a mar@@ g@@ inal and low @-@ neutral effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of g@@ ag in the har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies appeared not in connection with the incidence of undes@@ ired medicines , even if the occurr@@ ence of adverse reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reasons for the enzymes of enzymes in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulative sub@@ str@@ ats and preventing another accumulation of accumulation of enzymes .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from circulation and cells in the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recruited for the study , which covers the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient rejected the serious phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recruited if they had a for@@ c@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ respective volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of current FE@@ V and absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were then recruited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to improve the lung function and the ability to improve the lung function in the following table . &quot;
&quot; during the open renewal study , an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown from the following table . &quot;
the decrease of the percentage of current FE@@ V is not significantly reduced over this period and the absolute lung volume increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of increasing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with one Hep@@ atomic norm@@ ality , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease of the G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel was found in the Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ inin ) , which remained constant at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; regarding the hetero@@ gene@@ ous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients who were taken into account the clin@@ ically significant changes for five efficacy variable ( at the rate of the percentage of percentage variable ( 58 % ) , there was no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; an open @-@ year Phase 2 study was conducted , which mainly studied security and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the heavy run form and 4 with the middle s@@ alty form ) . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg over the last 26 weeks in Har@@ n in Har@@ n during the last 26 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size of growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined after the Z Score for these age group the younger patients with serious displacement form , while only limited or not any progress in cogn@@ itive development were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , investigations were carried out on the g@@ ag @-@ mirrors at the g@@ ag @-@ mirror in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet to be removed ( drugs against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant cancer ) has already spread slightly to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer , which does not attacks the cell epithel@@ ium cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is treated in patients who were previously untreated , in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies as a sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , the patients should take with A@@ lim@@ ta a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as folic acid ( a vitamin ) and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in addition to an &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drugs against vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent liquid man@@ gel ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood flow changes , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be reduced , removed or reduce the dose . &quot;
&quot; the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slow@@ ed down , thus avoiding the formation of DNA and RNA and avo@@ ids that the cells divide . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer response time in cancer cells . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta &apos;s treatment was studied in a major study on 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease previously .
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study enrolled 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( a further medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in were at an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.3 months at the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy had previously received an average survival rate of A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which cancer does not attack the cell epithel@@ ium cells , with the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival times than with compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a approval for the distribution of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
each bottle of water must be dis@@ solves with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - sis is taken from the bottle of water and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma except for overwhelming epi@@ th@@ eli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma except for superior epi@@ th@@ eli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
patients with non @-@ cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy is the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; on the day prior to treatment and sever@@ ity of skin reaction , the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed gift as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid is given . &quot;
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and intake must be continued during the entire duration of therapy and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose .
patients also have to receive a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after every third operator cycle .
&quot; in patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete bleeding should be created before each gift - including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ ocy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame @-@ tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be a ≤ 3 times of the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose of dose must take place under the end of the flow of blood or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the pre @-@ h@@ itting therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , the patients must be treated according to the instructions in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; if patients are non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient remains the value before treatment &quot;
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be broken when in patients after 2 dose reductions or non @-@ domestic tox@@ icity or non @-@ domestic tox@@ icity 3 or 4 or so@@ - at the appearance of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or more compared to patients in the age of 65 years an increased side @-@ risk analysis exists .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data for infin@@ ity and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical trials patients with a cancer @-@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min does not require dose @-@ adap@@ t@@ ations necessary , which are recommended for all patients with recommended Dos@@ age adjustment . &quot;
data in patients with a cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper b@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or tran@@ sam@@ pler values of &gt; the top of the upper limit value ( for breakdown of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( with the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in studies . &quot;
patients must not be administered to patients with regard to the Kno@@ - chen@@ w @-@ repression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ologist has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ tes reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadi@@ r of the absolute neutral density , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ se and maximum non @-@ domestic tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - the ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ th@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was de@@ emed when a pre@@ treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 was taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients must be treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients , folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophe@@ tic lact@@ ose measure to reduce tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) require in@@ tim@@ ely in@@ die non @-@ ster@@ oid antibodies ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - tens of 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients intended for a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , the taking of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients , when these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including D@@ eh@@ y@@ dr@@ at@@ ation , advanced high blood pressure , or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid accumulation , a drainage of the eff@@ ac@@ ity of eff@@ ected treatment is weighed . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported occasionally in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this drug was administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated li@@ mp@@ ed substances ( except white fever , this vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible shepherd , the reproductive ability exists through P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before treatment - G@@ inn insi@@ sted to take advice regarding the sperm level . &quot;
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid antibodies ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid may result in a reduced embar@@ rass@@ ment of side effects .
therefore beware when patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are applied in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - tens of 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no data regarding the interest of interest than Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , during therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - fixed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual variation of the body status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed with pregnant women but as at an@@ de@@ - an@@ tim@@ et@@ abol@@ ites are expected in an application in pregnancy for severe birth defects .
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if absolutely essential and after careful sever@@ ance of the use for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; because the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage of the reproductive ability exists by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment start , consultation with regard to the lock connectivity . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in breast milk and un@@ wanted effects can not be excluded .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and severe adverse effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ ial i@@ om , and 163 patients with mes@@ ial i@@ om , random@@ ized C@@ is@@ plat@@ in as Mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

clin@@ ically relevant CT@@ C tox@@ ic@@ ities that were reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients were random@@ ized P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , included su@@ vent@@ ric@@ ular ar@@ rhyth@@ ms . &quot;
the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory tox@@ icity 3 and 4 was similar in the combined results of three individual P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ mon@@ otherap@@ ists ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in the al@@ an@@ int@@ ran@@ ny ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .

&quot; clinical studies have been reported in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment occasionally cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fo@@ ration , intestinal per@@ fo@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ lit@@ is ) . &quot;
clinical studies have been reported in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment occasionally cases of sometimes fatal pneum@@ on@@ itis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency .
it has been reported about cases of acute kidney failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed Mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ on@@ itis were reported in patients who have been ir@@ radi@@ ated before or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; AL@@ IM@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y anti@@ fol@@ ate , which interrup@@ ts its effect by interrup@@ ting its impact dependent met@@ abolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;

primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received investig@@ ational medicine in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statistically significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ icious Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ cyclo@@ i@@ oma was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin @-@ arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in an improvement of lung function parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function in the time of the control arm .
&quot; a multic@@ entr@@ e , randomised , open phase III study with locally advanced or metastatic NS@@ CL@@ C ( int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and 9 months in patients with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology at the treatment effect fell on the overall survival in favour of NS@@ CL@@ C in patients with NS@@ CL@@ C ( n = 0.@@ 99 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data of a separately randomised controlled Phase 3 study shows that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of IT@@ T population and support non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination opposite the gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination .
&quot; mean PFS was 4.8 months for the combination of AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in compared to the combination of the AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 0,@@ 94 - 3@@ 3.9 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;

&quot; patients who were treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in were needed , needed less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ t@@ accumulation ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients required the gift of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin / Dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ etin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7,0 % , p = 0,0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed after the gift of mono@@ eu@@ tics were examined at 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tum@@ ors in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ - , over a period of 10 minutes . &quot;
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly unchanged in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the recommended dose may be found within 24 hours after the application unchanged in the urine .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life time in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
&quot; in a study with Be@@ agle @-@ dogs , which received intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us injec@@ tions for 9 months , test@@ inal changes were observed ( subject ration / ne@@ cro@@ sis of the semin@@ i@@ fer@@ en epithel@@ ial tissue ) . &quot;
&quot; unless otherwise applied , the storage times and conditions after preparation in the responsibility of the user and should not over@@ write 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C , unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
&quot; solve the contents of 100 mg of carbon dioxide ( 9 mg / ml ) with no preservatives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed . &quot;
the resulting solution is clear and colour@@ ing is ranging from colour@@ less to yellow or green yellow without the product quality is imp@@ aired .

&quot; in a third study , all@@ i was compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after a year had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg compared to 2.3 kg . &quot;
the study with all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for the relevant weight loss .
&quot; the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots at the after , Fl@@ atus ( winds ) , chair crisis , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , ling@@ ering / o@@ ily chair ( winds ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs . &quot;

the probability of occurr@@ ence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich meal or ob@@ ese diet .
&quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes with an improved met@@ abolic control can be used , patients who take a drug against diabetes before onset of treatment with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic may need to be adapted . &quot;
&quot; patients who take all@@ i as well as drugs against high blood pressure , or increased cholesterol , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of this drug must be adjusted . &quot;
it is recommended to meet additional s@@ anger@@ ment prevention activities in order to prevent any possible contra@@ cep@@ tive contra@@ cep@@ tive contra@@ diction in the case of severe diar@@ rhoea ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; both in a study of inter@@ actions from pharmac@@ euticals , as well as in several cases , with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ lo@@ in was observed a reduction of C@@ ic@@ lo@@ in plasma plasma monitors . &quot;
&quot; when using War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international norm@@ ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ car@@ otene remained in the standardi@@ zation range . &quot;
&quot; however , the patients should be recommended to take a supplem@@ entary of the Mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure a sufficient shell absorption ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of one disposable dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed at a limited number of volunteers , who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , observed a lower decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect imp@@ lications of pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and related to pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as the absorption of persistent fat is prevented . &quot;
&quot; the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg , over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary . &quot;
&quot; the most common areas are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , seldom known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of known @-@ known side effects that were established following the market launch by Or@@ list@@ at , is not known because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size . &quot;
&quot; 10 . it is plau@@ sible , that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to conversion in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects . &quot;
&quot; single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily , administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; at the majority of the reported cases reported cases of or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ do@@ zation , either no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on human beings and animal , systemic effects may be derived from a quick re@@ formation of systemic effects that are attributable to li@@ ve@@ al properties of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect continues in the l@@ umen of the lean and upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonds to the active ser@@ ine @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ kre@@ atic lights .

&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial outcome ( at the time of the Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , has been rated as follows : the change of body weight in the course of the study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those who have lost more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies , weight reduction was observed for 12 months , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the total chol@@ era amounted to 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .

plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abolic or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours following the oral gift of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , the therapeutic doses of met@@ abolic or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mol ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;

&quot; the most common adverse reactions occur with the response of the capsules together , and thereby resulting fat out of the body . &quot;
&quot; this side effects generally occur within the first weeks after the treatment of treatment , as you may have not consistently reduced the fat content in the diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules you can learn to minim@@ ize food @-@ related accompan@@ iment : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week , before the first intake of capsules with a fet@@ ched diet . • learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite food and about the size of serv@@ ings that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the probability that you exceed your fat limit . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat amount evenly to daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take it in the form of a low @-@ fat main point or a busy night &apos;s weight , as you may occur in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these accompanying symptoms occur , learn this with the time through adaptation of their diet . &quot;
• Medic@@ ines for children un@@ access@@ able . • Do not apply all@@ i to store the exp@@ iry date . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel which serve to keep the capsules dry .

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting ( such as C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ quity ) .
&quot; the application for patients under 18 years is not recommended , because there are not enough information in this age group . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active ingredient the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , prevents the recept@@ ors in the gut . &quot;
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong or moderate trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting .
&quot; at chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting are 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi ( 132 of 223 ) , over 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the poor trigger for nausea and vomiting , 81 % of patients suffering from Alo@@ xi was treated with Alo@@ xi ( 153 of 189 ) in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 127 of 185 ) patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted its approval from Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the distribution of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy due to cancer diseases and vomiting in moderate @-@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy due to a cancer disease .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vomiting , induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on mp@@ age , patients should be supervised by an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is provided with the simultaneous free gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medication that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or that tend to be an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with a further chem@@ otherap@@ eutic gift , Alo@@ xi should neither be used in the days after chemotherapy , nor for prevention of nausea and vomiting . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not affect tum@@ ours in the five examined chem@@ otherap@@ eutic agents ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady stick @-@ concentration of oral Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a population based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ an analysis , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , chlor@@ o@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , tor@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , rab@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , in@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , in@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experiences about the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies lie not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women unless it is considered to be considered by the treat@@ ise doctor . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the most common adverse events of 250 micro@@ grams were observed ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi in connection , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ flow reactions and reactions at the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) have been reported in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dose , similar levels of adverse events showed un@@ wanted events such as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose @-@ response relationships . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out due to the large distribution volume , but probably not effective therapy for a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ do@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1.@@ 132 patients who received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received intraven@@ ous times ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ous times . &quot;
&quot; in a randomised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , and Dac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients that were intraven@@ ously on day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of studies with moderately em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were similar to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the evidence of clinical investigation , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ can@@ als and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation involved in the management of action . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers study was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. exc@@ imer pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease in plasma concentration , a slow elimination of elimination of the body with an average termin@@ ale period of approximately 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally generally used in the total dose of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ@@ g / kg when dos@@ ages and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; according to a intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average temperature ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentr@@ ates at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0,@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached total exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the monthly intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg , however , the C@@ max was higher after the one of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; some 40 % elimin@@ ates the kidneys , and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
in vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; elimination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose is found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made approximately 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; according to a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous Bolshe@@ vism , the total body @-@ bodied 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver function , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al increases and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , which are considered adequate about the maximum of human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a small relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 out of the clinical trials that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and extend the promotional period of action .
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose ent@@ ails in approximately the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure of humans ) that have been given daily for two years , led to a prolifer@@ ative incidence of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine Ne@@ op@@ las@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , tri@@ ni@@ er@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not entirely known , but because of the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is designed for unique use , relevance of these results will be low . &quot;
&quot; the owner of this approval for the In@@ corporation will have to inform the European Commission on plans for the In@@ duction , approved in the context of this decision . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee on Human@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the regulatory approval for the treatment of hepatitis C prescribed by Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml injec@@ tion@@ ing solution was recommended . &quot;
&quot; this means that Alp@@ he@@ on is similar to a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , with the same active ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference agent &quot; ) . &quot;
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) Hepatitis C ( one of viral infection ) .
&quot; during a micro@@ sc@@ opic investigation , the liver tissue damage damage , in addition , the values of the liver disease al@@ an@@ al@@ amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood standard . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) has been incorporated in which it stimul@@ ates to the formation of the substance .
&quot; the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on submitted data to prove the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition , and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared to the efficacy of the reference rate of 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : e @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or Distribution of this document : what were the greatest concerns about the recommendation to disp@@ atch the CH@@ MP ?
&quot; in addition , concerns about the stability of the drug and the market@@ able drug are not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C who spoke to the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical trial . &quot;
&quot; after setting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on , the disease continues on more patients than in the reference agent ; in addition , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test was used to study the question of how far the medicine is immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( one with cr@@ ust formation of continuous skin infection ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ary ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ ves ) .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections , which were demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) , because alarm go could not be used against this type of infections . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years may not be used to treat skin surface than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not speak to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should again examine the patient and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
&quot; it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ ell , in which proteins are produced ) , thereby inhibit@@ ing the growth of bacteria . &quot;
&quot; the main inde@@ ator of the efficacy was in all five studies , the proportion of patients whose infection was carried out after the end of the treatment . &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients suffering from Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with placebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected people , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response : when the results of both studies were taken together with Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of the patients had both groups of both groups . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go has been diagnosed with the treatment of int@@ scenes ( all filled cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or of infection that were demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by M@@ RSA , is not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with alt@@ ar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation of the contract .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) termin@@ ates that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go over the short @-@ time skin infections suffer from the risks of superf@@ icial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , bleeding or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a approval for the annual sales of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the patients , where there is no improvement within two or three days , should be considered even once and an alternative therapy is considered ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of a Sen@@ si@@ bil@@ isation or severe local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is to be broken carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections where M@@ RSA is known as a path@@ ogen ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in secondary un@@ infected wound , the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was caused by infection with infection that caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin , St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) . &quot;
an alternative therapy is intended to be considered if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected passage occurs .
the effect of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentration , which have been achieved in humans according to top@@ ical application , or infected superf@@ icial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After simultaneous free gift of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased to the skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the small systemic exposure after top@@ ical use in patients , Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ iz@@ ations are not required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin will be applied during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproduction elast@@ icity after oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are in@@ adequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the f@@ öt@@ ale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to the gift of an antibiot@@ ic antibiot@@ ic .
&quot; in the decision , whether the breast@@ feeding continued / termin@@ ated or the therapy must be completed / termin@@ ated between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the nursing and the benefit of the alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections who have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported irrit@@ ation of irrit@@ ation at the administration , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of effect Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated from fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction in a specific binding point of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ oms differs from the bin@@ aries of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ious anti@@ bacterial substances .
data refer to that the Bin@@ ding site is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ able centre .
&quot; due to binding on this binding , P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line block the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , partial P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education of more active 50 ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local prevalence of resistance , ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear in at least some infectious forms , an advice should be targeted by experts . &quot;
&quot; no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin found compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isolation were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin . &quot;
&quot; in case of failure to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ cid@@ in ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was brought to int@@ ru@@ sion daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion , on intact skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be received twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
sampling took place 3 or 4 in adult patients before medi@@ ating and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic intake in humans after top@@ ical use of 1 % sal@@ be to 200 c@@ m2 / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ en has been convey@@ ed primarily by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid . &quot;
in vitro review on gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test and in the cultures of human peripher@@ al hem@@ at@@ ocy@@ tes and in rats micro @-@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo @-@ examination chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither with male nor in female rats signs of oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which reaches a maximum estimated exposure of exposure to 200 c@@ m2 ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in an embr@@ y@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study in rats , at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development aid icity ( decreased body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and maternal tox@@ icity . &quot;

&quot; it cannot be applied in eyes , mouth or lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the ano@@ inting from a view on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor about advice , if complaints occur . &quot;
&quot; after wearing the o@@ int@@ ment you can cover the affected area with a ster@@ il@@ en association or a gaz@@ ing tape , unless your doctor has got you to cover the surface . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in a aluminium tube with a plastic cap , which contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in a aluminium bag that contains 0,5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; ambient is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases that affect liver ) in children aged between a and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; in the context of one of two doses of existing vaccine , a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after administration of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , ambient may only be used when immun@@ isation has a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the existing vaccination plan can be led by two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ h dose is recommended for hepatitis A or B , ambient or other Hepatitis B or -@@ B vaccine can be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines act as they contribute to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) . &quot; how it can fight against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received a vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine since 1996 , which has been approved in the Twin@@ rix children since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same disease , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of one of three doses of existing vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data which supports the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults , also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main inde@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective anti@@ body concentration one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions . &quot;
ambient temperature resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection of developing antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of ambient ambient temperature was similarly high at a 12 @-@ month distance between the injec@@ tions .
&quot; the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , redness , mat@@ ity ( fatigue ) , and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ambient may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals . a. , an approval for the In@@ transport of Ambi@@ rix in the entire &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ in@@ ization with ambient temperature consists of two vacc@@ ines , with the first dose on the date of choice and the second dose is administered after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ hes is desired for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combined fuel . &quot;
the anti @-@ Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ gen values lie in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not fully assured whether immun@@ isation persons , which have been addressed to a hepatitis A@@ - vaccination , which are protected as protection , as they may not be protected by the immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As for all injec@@ tions , appropriate for the rare case of an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , appropriate opportunities for medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended using the combination solution that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; with hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and people with disturb@@ ances in the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibody is achieved , so that in these cases the gift of additional vacc@@ ines may be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injec@@ tions or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to an optimal in@@ optimal vaccination , these injec@@ tions should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ie or blood pressure disorders , ambient temperature can be sub@@ cut@@ aneous sub@@ cut@@ aneous sub@@ cut@@ aneous because it can occur in these cases following in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ ite Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ it@@ is@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , or with a combined mask m@@ um@@ ps , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ otherapy must be assumed that possibly no sufficient immune response is achieved .
&quot; in a clinical trial which leads with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , l@@ eness , gastro@@ enter@@ itis , headache , and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the former Thi@@ omer@@ al and preserv@@ ative vaccine form@@ ulating . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccination doses Ambi@@ rix were given up to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 and , including 15 years , the ambient of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses combination solution . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and pain at a calculation @-@ base per vaccination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not at a calculation of calculation per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combination . &quot;
&quot; following the complete vaccination of 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects , the ambient temperature was given over pain , compared with 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects that have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of Mat@@ ern@@ ity was comparable to proportion ( i.e. about the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects , the ambient temperature compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects that received the 3 doses combination ) . &quot;
the frequency of p@@ im@@ pregn@@ ated pain and mat@@ ology was low and comparable to which the combination of combination with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ sch@@ ema was observed .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year of vaccine , the appearance of local reaction and general inter@@ actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to which with the 3 doses of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen was observed . &quot;
&quot; however , the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , was reported a frequent occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
&quot; the share of vacc@@ inations containing heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ines with ambient temperature associated with 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B@@ - surface anti@@ gen reported , was not statistically different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies that were carried out at vaccination of 1 to including 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9,1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to month 6 with a 6 month dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose , and 100 % one month after the second , to the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparable study , which was carried out at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , received 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combination of combined with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 people whose immun@@ ity was assessed , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ vaccine significantly higher than with ambient . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical comparison study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after the termination of the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ inations were either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ inated with ambient temperature with a combination of 360 ELISA units , with a combined hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg of combined hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen . &quot;
the Per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies were detected at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with ambient ambient temperature in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccine for at least 24 months .
&quot; the immune response in this study observed immune response against both anti@@ gens was comparable with a combination of 360 ELISA units , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ at@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds showed that the Per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies were comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccination scheme , compared to the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccination scheme . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose is ambient in the second year of life simultaneously with the refres@@ hes of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ ite tox@@ ins ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ öt@@ t@@ ine vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective rates and ser@@ oc@@ rates as for the earlier formulation . &quot;
the vaccine is both before and after the reset selection by eye @-@ particles and / or physical visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis C virus is usually transmitted by viral food and beverages , but may also be transmitted by other ways such as swimming in water contam@@ inated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that possibly need a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , ambient temperature can not be complete in front of an infection with hepatitis C or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child before the administration of both vacc@@ inations Ambi@@ rix are already infected with hepatitis C or Hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel un@@ comfortable or sick / feel ) an vaccination may not prevent a condition .
&quot; protection against other infections , causing the liver injury or symptoms , which are similar to those based on hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection , can not be medi@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; if you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any element of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
an allergic reaction may express itself through it@@ ching skin suggestions , breath or swelling of your face or tongue . if you have an allergic reaction to hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . if you / your child have a severe infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months , prior to the appropriate administration of the second vaccination dose ) . &quot;
&quot; at a potential risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will rate you / your child from an vaccination with ambient . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective inventory per vaccination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a formal hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
&quot; the second vacc@@ ines of this vaccine with reduced content of effective inventory is usually administered one month after the first dose , and should give you a vaccination protection before completion of the vaccination series . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , ambient when people suffer from severe bleeding disorders is in@@ jected under the skin and not in the muscle . if you / your child are weak@@ ened due to a condition or treatment in your body &apos;s own defense / or if you / your child are under@@ lined with a ha@@ d@@ ash / or under@@ go . &quot;
&quot; ambient can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on vaccination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is . &quot;
21 S@@ itting your doctor if you / your child may take more medicines ( including those who have received no prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated with no prescription or if you have been given to immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) / or that is planned in the near future .
&quot; it can be , however , that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine must be given at ambient temperature at the same time , it should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as possible with different lim@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is given to the same time or just before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will be enough . &quot;
&quot; usually , ambient fl@@ ang@@ ers or lact@@ ating women is not administered except it is urg@@ ently needed that they are vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis B and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible . &quot;

&quot; based on the data , which has become known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the distribution , CH@@ MP grants positive opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , there is only one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) in traffic , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the small patient &apos;s exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ es@@ eed can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ full en@@ cephal@@ opathy or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ium concentrations ) in the history of history .
ammon@@ es@@ eed - divided into several single doses of meals - swallowed , among the food is mixed or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ also ( through the abdominal wall in the stomach of leading tube ) or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde ( through the nose in the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , since ammon@@ ves could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ medicine , i.e. without active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ium can also result in loss of loss , loss of acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid scal@@ ability , nausea , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) , at the end of the conclusion that ammon@@ aps in patients with disturb@@ ances of the ur@@ inary cycle could be increased to high ammon@@ ium values . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ es@@ eed was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; as due to the rarity of the condition at the time of approval , only limited information on this drug . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , where a complete en@@ rich@@ ness already has already manifested in the new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifested form ( in@@ complete enzymes , who mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life of life ) , an indication of an indication when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese consists of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ low , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient will be charged .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest@@ ation .
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ c@@ cin@@ at@@ synthetic deficiency must be preserved in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ low , because a risk of the emergence of O@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a exists if the tablets are not immediately to the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be applied in patients with con@@ genital heart failure or severe kidney @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium and in@@ dem@@ ise clinical conditions only with caution . &quot;
&quot; since met@@ abolic and ex@@ pressing of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at exceeds the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; for sub@@ cut@@ aneous treatment of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal deteri@@ oration and an increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functional nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be noted whether Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is eliminated in the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the breast@@ feeding time is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients at least one undes@@ ired event ( AE ) , at least 78 % of those undes@@ ired events were assumed that they were not connected to the AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; an likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tical patient who developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lact@@ ate , severe hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , Panz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; in case of a 5 @-@ month old small infant case , a minimum dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) occurred . &quot;
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate used in a intraven@@ ous administration of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ lim@@ atic neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phenol acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic @-@ active compound which con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine faced via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to urea ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disturb@@ ances of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that each gram of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
it is of meaning that the diagnosis was early pre@@ mat@@ urely and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical outcome .
&quot; the forecast of the early manifested form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infectious , and the disease led to the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ ues to death . &quot;
&quot; due to ha@@ ze di@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxi@@ di@@ ers ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate ) , protein reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first mon@@ k ) diagnosed disorders at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was diagnosed with many to spiritual disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ hic form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ city deficiency ) , treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some cases , a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate , which is used in liver and kidneys en@@ matic with glut@@ amine , whereby Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine arises . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in nour@@ ishing healthy adults , and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral dos@@ ages of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabolism was also investigated in cancer patients after a intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma concentr@@ ates were detected by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ mb@@ osis or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies was proven according to different doses phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day ) in the morning after no@@ c@@ ous fasting no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate in plasma .
&quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma concentration were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
&quot; the medicine is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses of rats treated no cl@@ ast@@ o@@ gens ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral dos@@ ing of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( infants and children who have no tablets , or patients with swal@@ low ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ aka or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde . &quot;
&quot; according to the previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , babies and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ inine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ pros@@ thes@@ es in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest@@ ation .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; in front of the birth , phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ o of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) were exposed to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the c@@ ort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; an likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tical patient who developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lact@@ ate , severe hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , Panz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to urea ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess water
&quot; based on investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , in patients with disturb@@ ances of the urine cycle can be assumed that each gram of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some cases , a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma concentr@@ ates were detected by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can keep the finished product uniqu@@ ely for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in this case , the small measuring sco@@ op 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved before use in water ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they can not separate the stu@@ ffy waste products that can not separate themselves after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you have examined laboratory studies , you have to inform the doctor that you can influence AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the breast@@ feeding time , you can &apos;t take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the medicine could be exagger@@ ated into the breast milk and damage your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste problems , after@@ math of obe@@ dience , disin@@ orient@@ ations , memory disorders , and deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; when you find one of these symptoms , sit down immediately with your doctor or with the emergency recording of your hospital for an appropriate treatment in connection . &quot;
&quot; if you forget the taking of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

&quot; angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood flow to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest strap with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; St@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( a abnormal measurement value at the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used for preventing blood cl@@ ots in patients to under@@ go a PCI , a higher dose is administered and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help people with att@@ ina or heart attack on maintaining blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , with which the effect of angi@@ ox when compared with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) compared to a conventional combination of blood cl@@ ots ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI patients a st@@ ent ( a short tube , which remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a sh@@ utter ) , and they received additional medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I , with a reduction of new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year overall as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who were subjected to a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective for all indicators as effective as Hep@@ ar@@ er , except for heavy bleeding , with which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ ar@@ co . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other brain or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it cannot be applied for patients who recently had a blood , as well as with a strong high blood pressure , or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) termin@@ ates that An@@ gi@@ ox is at the treatment of ACS and during a PCI , an acceptable replacement for Hep@@ ar@@ cs . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a approval for the distribution of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ ms ( inst@@ ab@@ ile att@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift ) ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) in an emergency handle or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is carried out a PCI in further row , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given for the duration of the intervention of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be taken up for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; an in@@ fusion of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered directly before the procedure , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous charge of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
safety and effectiveness of a sole Bol@@ us gift of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / kg should be made . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the appearance of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed and the bolt can be administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which should be subjected to a PCI ( whether using bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; the ACT @-@ Value below 225 seconds , is a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg , and the ACT once again test the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which led to approval in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which was included , the ACT was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ ing at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see below 4.3 ) . &quot;
treatment with angi@@ ox can be diver@@ ted 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ fra@@ tion@@ ated Hep@@ ar@@ mo@@ ons or 8 hours after the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Hep@@ ar@@ cs .
• unknown hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the substance or other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active blood damage or higher bleeding disorders . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients with di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully tested during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if a PCI patients occur under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages of arter@@ ial pun@@ cture , in patients suffering from per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment of principle occur everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , an monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) should be taken to ensure that the value of treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in will be achieved in front of the treatment existing level . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge about the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( Hep@@ ar@@ gon , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these active ingredients may increase blood risk . &quot;
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ants or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters in each case regularly control .
&quot; the animal examinations are in@@ adequate in terms of effects on the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , in@@ adequate or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see below 5.3 ) . &quot;

both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the compar@@ ative compar@@ ative groups of women as well as in patients over 65 years were more likely to adverse events than male or younger patients .
severe bleeding were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i units for heavy bleeding as shown in Table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred among bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone less frequently than in the group with Hep@@ ar@@ ov@@ b plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ IB / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ oral , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or blood in the pun@@ cture , minim@@ ize the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood damage , re@@ operation due to blood pressure , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;

&quot; the following details on side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at 6000 patients , which were subjected to a PCI . &quot;
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the compar@@ ative compar@@ ative groups of women as well as in patients over 65 years were more likely to adverse events than male or younger patients .

the following side effects that are not listed above were reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organs in Table 6 .
&quot; in the case of an overdose , treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is immediately breaking away and the patient eng@@ ined in regard to signs of blood . &quot;

&quot; in the case of the patients a PCI was performed , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in was given , and in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h should be increased . &quot;
&quot; in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , untreated Hep@@ ar@@ isation or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin was administered according to relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ drom ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM I ) . &quot;
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of the Rand@@ om@@ isation ) or the PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high risk characteristics were required by angi@@ ography within 72 hours , evenly across the 3 treatment arms . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes , which require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdominal wall , the upper th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm , administered or as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
&quot; diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for the regulation of glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood , or does not process insulin . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter response time has a short @-@ effective crime . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a type 1 diabetes in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 5@@ 72 adults and a study of 5@@ 72 children between four and 17 years .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults in type 2 diabetes where the body insulin does not work effectively .
the main inde@@ ator for the efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study with type 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % for insulin l@@ is@@ per . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % of human levels .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may possibly be adapted , if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the glucose level . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ o@@ fi @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Deutschland GmbH to offer a approval for the distribution of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is either used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the area of abdominal wall or the delta angle , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal wall . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced ti@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin delivery , insulin supplies can be reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of active power , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ able@@ etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can draw a change of insulin demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 A in@@ adequate dosage or breakdown of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and an diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ azi@@ one ; these states are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the change@@ over of a patient on another insulin type or an insulin in another manufacturer should take under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage .
&quot; at the time of the occurr@@ ence of a hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the actual profile of the insulin , it can therefore change the schem@@ atics . &quot;

&quot; in addition , symptoms of sympath@@ e@@ oly@@ tics such as bet@@ rot@@ ters , cl@@ on@@ id@@ ine , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reserves can be weak@@ ened or missing the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ ches counter . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies for reproductive tox@@ icity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ oid with regard to the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin does not appear in the breast milk , nor is it possible after oral use . &quot;
&quot; listed below are the results of clinical trials registered according to system organs and arranged according to the frequency of their occurr@@ ence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of being available ) . &quot;

severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with loss of consciousness can be treated with a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after a glu@@ ing injection , the patient should be supervised in a hospital to determine the original cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the peripher@@ al glucose intake ( especially due to skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as inhibit@@ ing of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ it takes place faster and the response time is shorter than in hu@@ - man@@ ned normal levels .
&quot; in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years , insulin @-@ inflammatory doses of 0.0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glucose levels , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a lower risk increase in the glucose level of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a double so fast mode of action like normal human insulin , achieving the complete glucose levels of approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin . &quot;
&quot; the data was clearly stated that at an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ den@@ ial gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal was ge@@ ared , a better post@@ den@@ ial control was accomplished before meal , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the start of the meal is applied , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal insulin , the 2 billion gro@@ oves in front of the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in gift 2 minutes before the start of the meal compared to human levels before the start of the meal , 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) , as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given for 2 minutes ( Figure 1B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin delivery in gift of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - after the start of the meal ) after the start of the meal compared to human@@ kind , the 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) was given before the start of the meal ( Figure 1C ) . &quot;
