<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for inclusion (1 mg / ml) and an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. comres thinking and talking, hallucinations (listening or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and madness; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness in which the patients manic episodes (periods of abnormal upswing) alternate with periods of normal tuning."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the past, Abilify is used to treat moderate to serious manic episodes and in the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">"injectioning solution is applied for quick control of weakly restlessness or behavioral disorders, if the oral ingestion of the drug is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both cases, the solution can be used for inducing or melting tablets in patients with the swallowing of tablets difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients receiving other medicines at the same time, the dose of Abilify should be adapted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells among themselves."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works mainly as a "partial agcolonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means Aripiprazol such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less than the neurotransmitters, in order to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, which will reduce the activity of the brain, which will reduce psychotic or manic symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, to prevent the symptoms of symptoms, was studied in three studies above until one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of injectioning solution was compared with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared with schizophrenia, or similar diseases, compared to placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Halopidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo that had been reconstituted in which the manic symptoms had been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injectioning solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which compared to increased restlessness, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the variation of the symptoms of patients underwent a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke on the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the company also led trials to investigate, how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution for inducing stress (up)."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with injectioning solution patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased agitation than those who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"when applying for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify diminished in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented any more effective than placebo the refractional episodes of previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg cans, also more effective than placebo had reduced the symptoms increased, similar to Lorazepam."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify to intake (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extraordinate disorders (drowsiness), vomiting, Nausea (drowsiness), vomiting, blurred vision, dynasty (drowsiness), fatigue and exhaustion, helmets (sleep disturbances) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee on Humantilizers (CHMP) was at the end that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from medium-heavy to serious episodes of patients who had predominantly manic episodes, and with those of the manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol, compared against the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the result that the advantages of injectioning solution in the rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes at Bipolar-I disorder, when oral therapy is not suitable, compared against the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a approval for the distribution of Abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">"ABILIFY is used for the treatment of moderate to serious episodes of the bipolar disorder, and for prevention of a new Japanese episode in patients, the predominantly manic episodes, and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"an increased efficacy in dosages on a daily dose of 15 mg was not demonstrated, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY amounts to 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monootherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dosage should be considered, when clinical factors are justified (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripid dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset of an antipsychotic therapy (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disorder had no increased risk of risk with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazol should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiac diseases (myocardial infarction, heart failure disorders, hypoglyphation, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure reducers) or hypertonia (including accelerated and maligne form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if with ABILIFY treated patients and symptoms of a late dyskinitis, should be drawn into consideration, reduce the dose or to break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient symptoms and symptoms evolve to a mns, or without a clear fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore Aripiprazol should be used in patients with seizures in the Anamnese, or with conditions that are related to crampons."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis which were associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, had an increased death in comparison to placebo."</seg>

<seg id="47">"a weight gain is generally known for schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is observed and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is required when Aripiprazol in combination with alcohol or other centralised medicines with self-controlled side effects such as seals (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-Antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical trial with healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased its AUC by 107% while the Cmax remains unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosing reductions."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (=" "poor") metabolisation, the common use with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 has resulted in higher plasma concentration of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensively. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors to ABILIFY, the potential benefit should be the potential risk for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteasors, might have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosing reductions."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the ABILIFY should be upgraded to the dosing height before the start of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Ditiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 to be administered jointly with ABILIFY can be reckoned with a moderate increase in Aripima concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol have no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethylan / 3-methodology of morphine) and 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethylan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to inadequate data conditions for the safety of human beings and due to the reproduciary studies, this medication may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits does not justify the potential risk for the foetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, in other antipsychotics, the patients should be warned against, dangerous machines, including power vehicles, until they are safe that Aripiprazol has no negative impact on it."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes, which require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is subcutaneous subcutaneous (under the skin) in the abdominal wall, the upper thighs or the upper arm, administered or as continuous infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for the regulation of glucose levels (sugar) in the blood, or does not process insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter response time has a short-effective crime."</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a type 1 diabetes in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 572 adults and a study of 572 children between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Apidra was studied in a study with 878 adults in type 2 diabetes where the body insulin does not work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indeator for the efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance glycosylified hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study with type 1 diabetes, after six months a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined compared to a decrease of 0.14% for insulin lisper."</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of HbA1c-concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% of human levels.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive (allergic) against insulin lulisin or one of the other components, or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the doses of Apidra may possibly be adapted, if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the glucose level."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to offer a approval for the distribution of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra is either used as subcutaneous injection, either in the area of abdominal wall or the delta angle, or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of abdominal wall."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced tiogenesis capacity and reduced insulin delivery, insulin supplies can be reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of active power, the brand (Her- Steller), of insulin (normal, NPH, zinkableetc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can draw a change of insulin demand."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 A inadequate dosage or breakdown of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and an diabetic ketoaziazione; these states are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient on another insulin type or an insulin in another manufacturer should take under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage.</seg>
