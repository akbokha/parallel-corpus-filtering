&quot; the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its low size , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some functions of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available . &quot;
for further information on the use of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select settings enh@@ ancements .... open the card tools and select the desired modules . &quot;
this is a list of standard integration modules from the package K@@ DE ; add @-@ ons . please note that you may have more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the package base , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you comp@@ ile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras bl@@ acks . then you can view the page , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crash@@ es if present , del@@ eting . &quot;
the An@@ gli@@ filter module ( also known as folder ) can be reached in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras . with the module you can filter &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current work directory on different kind of filters .
&quot; to view the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the just shown website . as default , the display starts with the root notes of the document , for example : the element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ assemblies of this root no@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; represents a further view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views , to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem . &quot;
&quot; the characteristics of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of showing narrow folder folder hier@@ arch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree Map . Tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in perfor@@ ated structures . each object is shown by a rectangle with its size . this size must possess the size of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries is specified . in this way , large files can be detected , even if it can be seen below in the folder hier@@ archy , but it can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; commands you are considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rectangle , which represents a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles possess meaningful colour and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the colour of a rectangle , which is switched over view of color mode , can be either present to the light detection of the fusion or image of another file , such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rectangle can be labeled with the various characteristics of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature , you can define whether there is enough space for displaying if there is enough space for displaying the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . moreover , you can define the relative position of inscri@@ bing in the rectangle . &quot;
&quot; in preparation algorith@@ ms for tre@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this process will not always be kept in order to cover the entries of entries , and this framework will not be lost when the rectangle is square . &quot;
&quot; as distribution of the surface of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ates entries takes place , the implementation is left up . here it is intended for labelling and avo@@ idance of space losses due to the scope of space . the best methods of this concerning are lines , columns or recur@@ sive second . &quot;
&quot; you can define the minimal area for an entry about the menu entry . instead , a R@@ aut@@ en@@ pattern is drawn into the area of an over@@ ordered entry to indicate that this area is actually covered by a sub@@ ordin@@ ated entry . &quot;
&quot; originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , which was developed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ rin@@ d . &quot;

how to set this and work with raw files is described in the phases of Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h @-@ Work@@ flow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera location is provided , so that you can connect to your digital camera and supports your photos directly into &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; albums g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium is supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium is supported by your operating system , with &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; work together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are drawing through the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) to data transmission . the camera can also be used as turn@@ out drive . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 is also used to communicate with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , continuous software collection for digital cameras , which has an continuously increasing number of digital cameras supported by the International Imag@@ ing Industry Association . it allows the transmission of digital cameras to host computers and other peripher@@ als without the need of additional driver . &quot;
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . as photos in general files are slow and transm@@ is@@ sions about the serial port . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; supports these cameras and leads the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so the EX@@ IF support is required by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 cam@@ ouflage . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may possibly see any visible pictures or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; is how easy its functionality is enlarged by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug@@ ins interface Project ( manual ) is a joint module structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules of all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate pictures in almost every way , as it can also manipul@@ ate it . its advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; to carry out . &quot;

&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; introduces a lumin@@ ous table in a separate window , which allows you to compare pictures . it works with all supported image formats , also raw files , together . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L to the fluorescent menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ ous menu and open its window . if you are back in &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; main window , you can open the LEDs quickly with L ex@@ tras . &quot;
&quot; from the front bar you can compare the pictures you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window and place there . a small arrow shows you to what copy of the tool bar will be able to perform and re@@ operations at one of the images , then they will compare the same section of the two pictures . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to insert quickly from a picture series . if you are using pair of images from the tool bar , then the two first pictures are automatically displayed in the left hand side . now , the left mouse button will be displayed in the right hand side . this makes it easier to pass through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , normal soldering transactions are also working directly from the table as e.g. F4 file ... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right side bar of the main window , are available for both models in the illumin@@ ant . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each area , you will find a built @-@ in go@@ ose function which you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to push the visible range of the image , you need to click this button and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then in the mode you will display the same image range . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom controller under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom in the picture in and out . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode preview .
what is a digital data management - away from the fashion word ? digital data management considers any part of the process after the image has been taken up to the final edition and the permanent storage . each of the photos opens up to the final issue and the permanent storage . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool to backup a plan and practical tips how to back up your pictures , locate , protect and upload photos . we consider downloading the process for digital photographers . let us consider downloading , ren@@ aming , optimize , optimize , exp@@ iry , and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ or@@ ised , sec@@ ures , searches , transformed , contra@@ cted and exported content to a monetary or cultural value . quot ; &quot;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata are provided according to your definition data that provide information about or a documentation of other data that are administ@@ rated by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not need to find a certain photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have to store , then use the met@@ ad@@ ata to save both in a database and secure archives on which you can freely access other programs , platforms , and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you have to do and know before you can stay any in your system , the structure information structure will somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide whether other access to your photos will need to save if you have to switch to a reserved drive , or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you need to switch to a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday images can be found quickly via your location . if you &apos;re using enough photos , then you will need sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then , you will release a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archi@@ ving , working processes , constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files are and you will not want to organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what kinds of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes remote processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option in the site of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; therefore , this ensures that ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget it , then you can select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? for this purpose , &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; give them a met@@ ad@@ ata Editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , since you should select every photo keyword , labelling and an evaluation . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then use the value . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s proceed with keyword , key words , as you proceed with other programs frequently , or proceed categories . all three syn@@ ony@@ ms are equal to the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import Cat@@ alog@@ ical pictures from another source with natur@@ alized keyword , then the tree will insert the pictures to the correct position . the sort of hier@@ archy inside the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by removing a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are being pursued by &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; updated while the underground trees are pursued . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over@@ cutting . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata is composed in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar dates for all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keyword - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool for catalog@@ u@@ ing your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you want to just see most of your photos only , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say you that the landing field of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y is 60 years after the landing is . Wow ! it starts to dream , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself . if you are showing pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is the meaning for the viewer to help Him about the motive that you can understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine , when a picture is not perfect , if the strength only has a lab@@ eling for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you can save a lot of text in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) as inscri@@ bing . if you can export your pictures in Web galleries , then these labels will tell you for a selection of images in the inscri@@ bing and / or the title of the Web @-@ gallery system . so you have to tell the story about the opening process no second time . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a bo@@ red planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? good because with pictures the train from spatial presentation is now already with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities the ge@@ ol@@ ocation @-@ outs are already unbe@@ atable and will be deeper into the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your trips with ge@@ ographic data . you can also download the pictures at the reception location . you can also download the pictures on the reception . you can also export the pictures on the Google Maps . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . you can also export the pictures on the Google Maps viewer . &quot;
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and signi@@ fies the practice of use the copy@@ rights to remove limitations on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information is stored in the setup page of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; as information should be deposited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onymous with writer and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the photographers , for example , to protect the photographers name , then the name of a company or organisation can be used . after that value , it cannot be changed . this field does not support comple@@ xes nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; author Chapter ( syn@@ onymous with author ) : associated with the author . examples of the photographer does . examples of this field may be titles as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ ie for author , this also must be filled out . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the An@@ bi@@ dder field to identify the photo . if the photographer has to be listed here , this organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a photo agency , then the group / agency offers the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not have protection against abuse . everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can only delete this problem for the majority of your photos only by low interest . for professionals and hal@@ b professionals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique in a picture . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; will provide a module for st@@ acking processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : record error , record loss , EC@@ C , transmission error , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disin@@ teg@@ rating , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ itions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs recorded on the street or a fire . this kind of losses are the same which can happen to you at traditional paper photographs or negative . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; cro@@ ll On@@ soundtrack , the world &apos;s largest database production company , has some interesting statistics that has a loss of data loss . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , this c@@ auti@@ ous drug must not be treated more than a couple of years . of course you can also claim CDs and DVDs in archive quality . of course you can claim CDs and DVDs in archive quality . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollars ; 2 that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your measuring room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good dis@@ cos and good recording sessions and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much reliable . so it &apos;s going to select the right . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to error , even if you were just written . therefore , use a control block mechanism to protect themselves . therefore , they use only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ att@@ ing and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection , it is needed for form@@ att@@ ing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for defects CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs , but is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that damaged data of damaged flo@@ ppy disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drive etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything was also said to CDs and DVDs , of course also for the Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; continue to burn with a good recording device at high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . please read the media using a description , date &amp; author and afterwards on a clean , dark dry and before animals protected location . do not forget to read the data on the next generation of media or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; disk manufacturers keep your statistics for itself . its manufacturer addresses include a new disk , but not the data . Google makes a large field study on the hard mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ missing discs &quot;
&quot; shortly : dis@@ ks hold the longest in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common cause of the controller are the most common cause of error , SM@@ ART can not realize this error . some of the SM@@ ART can determine the immediate effect of age . these are particularly reading time periods . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power supply before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be re@@ produced without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices are not much to make use of devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause heavy data loss , hard@@ war@@ e@@ jec@@ tives , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect themselves before un@@ avo@@ id@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; most widespread protection against power tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is part of the energy heat absor@@ bs and the rest assured . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . but remember that not every plug @-@ in bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protect the protection against lightning bolt and protects the appropriate devices . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can use to your computer , you should also make sure that all peripher@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers also provide over@@ voltage as well . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage as well as a phone connection for your modem . others provide connection possibilities for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a multitude of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore also include protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for travel . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection system protects your system in front of smaller variations in the electricity lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of few seconds can result in loss of adverse data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ l@@ ash@@ ings , these devices will automatically provide battery power when a power loss occurs . some models allow you to continue to save your data and use the system again . if you use US@@ V , you should be sure that they get the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the battery life of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting . &quot;
concern your potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its safety at power problems with the cost of avo@@ idance of this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection may cost you up to Euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you think you should always remember all the cables before you ride in the holidays .
&quot; the Amazon web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to save this as backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; however , they are compared to the hard drives at home but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; Dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . moreover , you have to send the data on compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but there is no general safety solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services to have cli@@ cked on photos . your free memory is limited to photos , in the case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you will get unlimited memory which should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors will be automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large number of firms are included in the offer . therefore , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calcul@@ ator . all transfers are due to transmission errors . at least , the fil@@ esystem is at least the data inclusive between operating system and hard disk . &quot;
the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred . all these disturb@@ ances remain un@@ discovered until you have been destroyed during your computer . no one seems to have any protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than that in your computer .
&quot; un@@ reliable network parts are a further source of transfers , since they produce interfer@@ es within the data flow . in normal file systems , this error remains un@@ noticed . &quot;
even if you are currently not especially affected by transmission problems you should look into the future . already 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
&quot; Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle record players on low level and can be highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has started its own initiative with his b@@ ays system . it is still in the alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that are used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate these two factors for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook , 46 % of data loss . in not@@ ebooks , the share of theft amounts to 50 % . &quot;
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most common . it leads to a lower damage as such as theft steels or new installations ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under Linux ; no one has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
&quot; open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems : false , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the exam@@ ining process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file is not completely stored before the problem is up , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras sensors are removed from fundamental physical borders , meaning that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s cameras go in direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ xels . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the final result , the optimum sensor for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apixel resolution . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; so , you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you don &apos;t make any other data loss . so , you get your data often after a plan and test it before you do anything more dangerous such as the re@@ installing your operating system , sharing the exchange of disks or the size of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive daily . if , one day , a lightning strikes you if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster suggests locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget plane accident coins : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or the whole house . &quot;
&quot; therefore Des@@ ast@@ er@@ ating is always a non @-@ local store . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighbouring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as already mentioned above is a more common cause for data loss in spite of safegu@@ ard the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be secured . it is a moment without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
&quot; differentiation : securing the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete moment on two periods : the complete backup , and the last differentiation . &quot;
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : securing the files that have been changed since the last backup . this creates several moment . you can recover the original status at any time . this f@@ use comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that it is , and not continuously . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that allows you to set up easily on your machine . in contrast to the script controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts they only change the difference of files that happens . this happens and if you want to increase the security of ssh .
&quot; secure important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer , on a DVD or another optical media . &quot;
&quot; this approach lets you get enough time to explore losses and restore again . at the end , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment for at least one month and a moment for every month . every further di@@ lution should happen manually , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , in the image file saved IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , documents , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so valuable images can survive the next 40 year , that about the period of time in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; because the future is un@@ predic@@ table due to your nature , everything is said to be careful with caution and evaluate while the time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to ask oneself like the current system backward . the less variants you use in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to read your images , then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you can change your computer architecture , memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard . keep in open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this does actually mean to enlarge .
&quot; let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with your plans and have placed the area you want to enlarge a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix , like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this range and lay hold on a new record : &quot;
&quot; with the command d@@ mes@@ g , check whether your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang them . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Dollars ; dd if = / dev / SD@@ B &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / SD@@ B , the new record is / dev / S@@ DC &amp; Dollars ; size with ext@@ 3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; Dollars ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier by year .
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . therefore , you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard of GIF . however , it can save much more . it is loss @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can recommend it as many as T@@ IFF , but not as many as T@@ IFF , we recommend to save your pictures . &quot;
T@@ IFF was widely used as picture format . T@@ IFF can store in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression sal@@ es@@ m ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . there are therefore many photos stored in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the T@@ IFF / EP format and is required to use met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer D@@ NG is already available now and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block block ; the file information is provided with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer a original of your photo , mostly in the rough format , to be archi@@ ved . X@@ MP likes to view the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file . so you may consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that will support itself for fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata ards , which includes a large area of application purposes and business models , annual conferences and workshops , annual conferences and educational efforts to reach a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ at@@ enst@@ and@@ ards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures are on the camera , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not implemented .
for a host@@ ile editing you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata . these were cut down among the other programs .
&quot; protect the processed pictures for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only then in Web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact leaves , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera @-@ interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; you will find a description of how you have photos that you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your family database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; to use , connect these with the calcul@@ ator , turn the camera on display mode and turn it up . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera &apos;s interface , it tries to take a while using your camera . if the connection is made , a Fer@@ tig -@@ indicator at the bottom end and the presentation pictures of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras will not appear in pictures for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information on each entry . with the aspect properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera @-@ interface , you can see the features of an entry or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
this dialogue displays File Properties and the photo information to be stored intern@@ ally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded on your computer . note that at some digital cameras does not have any information available .
&quot; the rider Metad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc . these information is the same as at the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; or the image processing . note that this met@@ ad@@ ata is not available at some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button and then download the photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; we will download the photos stored in an album before you delete the pictures from the camera .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired selection methods of &amp; K@@ DE ; select the button download and then download the selected files . the button chosen can be selected as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these pictures have not yet been downloaded from &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; in this case , the new pictures have been selected with a star in the fore@@ front window . if you choose this option , you &apos;ll only download the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you can download or download the buttons , a dialogue with which you can select the target album . the list of existing albums will be sorted in the section My albums , select the list from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can all delete it by clicking the button . if you want to delete it only , you &apos;ll need to delete it first and delete the delete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there are no possibility to restore from the camera , they are not deleted in the rub@@ b@@ ish of &amp; K@@ DE ; you should be careful if you want to delete pictures from the camera ; if you want to delete the camera &apos;s camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos frequently not especially unusual . the file names will usually run back , if you upload photos of different recording records into the same album . therefore it can be useful to integrate the date and time , in which the image has been made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and e@@ wers of the picture and for date bas@@ kets . if you use this latter option , automatically will automatically create a folder a day . &quot;
&quot; the options during the transmission opens three more options that are carried out before the photos are stored on the record . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF information is copied into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
if you want a different dat@@ ashe@@ ets than the standard format you can use the pre@@ fix photo % - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn the option date &amp; time . for more custom@@ iz@@ ations you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
&quot; if you use the camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in small letters , or if you prefer it . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; for a photo , is displayed below the name , will be displayed below the name , the camera will be stored in the preview site , and will be used automatically if you can open the camera window . &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic rotation during the loading . not all cameras provide this information ready . in the section page bar met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
&quot; the automatic rotation is normally turned on , and if your camera leaves this information , it leaves &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic rotation and select the automatic rotation at the lower section of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera has been made information about the date , at which the photo was made available , and this sub@@ mer@@ gers are based on the image data . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . all the pictures featuring the same date will be downloaded in the same sub@@ album . in the page side@@ bar Meta @-@ data you can read what information can be embedded into the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case , &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; the photos directly on the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to activate the button , and select the date @-@ based sub@@ edge at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer on their camera is downloading the button download . select the file optional dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; select the file optional dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods you can choose .
&quot; after the picture selection is done , ask &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you , where the images will be uploaded . select the desired file and press OK to launch the upload . images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general term in this document , that is meant to be displayed in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude and that can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographer , it can be interesting to link the image with a precise geographical location . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural office and real estate agents can use this capability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten your photo , where exactly the photo was done , you can send a postcard to another &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; users want to locate the place of the photos , or simply order to en@@ rich the position data of a photos . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 are many GPS data fields , such as direction , arti@@ llery and map refer@@ r@@ ations . so there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a desc@@ endant of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical assignment ( manual ) and last above the manual search of well @-@ known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there are currently no camera that has a GPS unit integrated . but there are a few working together with GPS receiver . either as card module or via transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iPad A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel , as this is the only format , which is supported by the module for ge@@ ographic assignment . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS compatible with the data of pictures and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itud@@ inal and lat@@ itude or other data , then you can use this script by using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the fore@@ sign @-@ based coordinates that can be created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street cards . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; try to give you much control over his work processes as possible . there are many att@@ itudes to access the behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; to access this settings , you need to set up in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; action can be shown on embedded preview or image editing , making it the default behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; firm if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standard candidate and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , when the option is synchron@@ ized in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author Chapter is a syn@@ onym for the editor &apos;s line : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer , as a photographer , freelance photographer or more independent , commercial photographer , this also has to be filled . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author if this is a photo agency , as such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group should be listed here , then the group and agency will be available here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC rim . this met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; . this met@@ ad@@ ata is also available and can be imported in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; imported without losing .

&quot; the page settings contains all the options for the information that appear , if the mouse poin@@ ter in the main window is resting on a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; di@@ gi@@ ed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; to determine which file extensions are added ; alb@@ um@@ folders that has no support of these extensions ; igno@@ res any of these extensions ; ignored . &quot;
default settings can be reset to you by pressing the button on the right from each category .
&quot; the settings of the beam of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , if you use the fluorescent mode , you should only use different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can obtain better viewing results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can switch the tool bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and lower areas of a picture can be marked with dar@@ ker and light colour in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing , this review can be switched with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling , the images are coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the immediate explanation . &quot;
&quot; by setting P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since P@@ NG requires a loss of loss and packing . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can use this value to a high compression . it means 1 : low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; using the T@@ IFF file , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate -@@ compression sal@@ es@@ m for T@@ IFF images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IFF images . it has no influence on image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm work @-@ free . &quot;
&quot; with the loss of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can loss loss @-@ free . even if you select the loss of loss and file size far better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was still not supported , but was still in planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the image processing was only a picture mark for photos . currently , it was developed very quickly to a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the standard intake is that all green pixels are equal to more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in the output . if you use this option , you solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option records the image a little soft , eliminated but the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white default of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white is not set . standard is it a fixed colour balance , which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
&quot; this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . using the second sensors , using the second sensors , the effect that sub@@ strate images will get more details in the top @-@ cutting edge . for other cameras , this option will be ignored . &quot;
&quot; the standard is the sh@@ lich@@ ter , so the parts of your images are embedded as penet@@ rated white in the settings . the setting colours generates some unusual results , because they try to re@@ design some parts of the missing information from the lights . &quot;
this is possible because there are blue pixels in general not as fast as green and red . &amp; di@@ gi@@ w therefore try to re@@ design the missing green and red propor@@ tions made of the not satisfied blue pixels . of course this is a question how many colour or white you want .
&quot; if you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three a compromise and can be adjusted separately for each image . &quot;
put the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; image processing is too small to keep you conservative .
&quot; a demo @-@ based algorithm is a digital picture process , to calculate a complete picture of the particles , which have many cameras and the matrix color pixels are available . this algorithm is also known as CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ lla . &quot;
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w has three alternatives to you : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . according to some tests it looks like this . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used on the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenti@@ ls , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color @-@ correction correction , since it is carried out during rough conversion . &quot;
&quot; a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions as it should be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; information like the colour of colour space in the other , so the colors are as possible . &quot;
&quot; behavior questions , when a picture is opened in image processing / color administration module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; color profile file S@@ ing here the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / user / / color / ICC , where you store all your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; examine these folders then during the start . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to back . everything can be changed when opening the shell file later .
the color administration view is an alternative against X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are just your pictures colour@@ ing not the whole screen .
&quot; the input profiles should be made to the camera player and model you &apos;re using . not all profiles are created on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have a paint tone mapping or gam@@ ma@@ correction . this means that you need to perform the color mapping itself at 16 bit depth . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the soft @-@ pro@@ of @-@ profile , which you can em@@ ulate on how your image can be returned from a device as your camera has a smaller colour range than your camera and some colours therefore can be saturated , instead of being able to rely on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious what colour profile is provided for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles the fit together . this answer is un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension refers to the style for the target : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neut@@ ron , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plug@@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; K@@ DE ; image processing and image processing is supported . many modules support , which are written to cooperate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the list of available modules . these modules appear as new entries in the main window &apos;s menu and beyond , you will find some also in the context menu of the fore@@ see menu . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks , which are performed by modules , can be set in the menu under Settings short command . &quot;
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be accessed via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ in .org or in the books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the se@@ ash@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regulator is adjusted the time between the outputs , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes are on the met@@ ad@@ ata or from which at the bottom end of the pictures are displayed during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera characteristics are shown on the left side a list of all the time supported cameras . on the right hand there is a button of automatic detection , which is trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . currently there are Seri@@ al , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass memory . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage camera . this field is only active when you set a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass memory camera from the camera box . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / , you need to hang onto your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer to put it into the display mode and turn off . &quot;
&quot; try out if &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set your camera , your camera will appear in the camera . &quot;
you can select any name for your camera . this will be displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera you can insert all here .
&quot; with the confir@@ ming dialog for the shifting of &gt; images in the rub@@ b@@ ish , you can set the talk of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; you can set up a photos in an album . in the par@@ agra@@ phs of a photos and del@@ e@@ tion of a record you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes by the right side bar can be shut down in silence , if you use the option changes in the right side bar without question . otherwise , you have to use the changes with the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also read the display of the welcome image of &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; at the start , this acceler@@ ates the start of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate under circumstances . &quot;
&quot; the setting up after new photos are looking for new photos , looking for new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the starting time of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; if something from the basic folder was er@@ ased , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you want to delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; to adjust the main window to your taste . this settings can select under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested , a new design for &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; to create , you will find more information about this tut@@ orial . &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; contains quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to watch your photos and for correction and improvement . image processing can be launched by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the entry menu of the preview / Edit menu .
&quot; the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; therefore , you are not part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules you will find in section image processing . &quot;
&quot; a status bar at the bottom edge of the window , the file name , current fil@@ en@@ ame , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size . &quot;
one menu bar on the upper edge and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
&quot; editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , no functions will change the original photo , before you save the file or Save the button Save as soon as you have saved the original photo anymore as soon as you have saved the original photo . &quot;
&quot; so , you should be able to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file save . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original picture by rest@@ oring the image editing and restore the button to restore the image processing in the tool@@ bar . then you lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last store . &quot;
&quot; nearly any promotion of the image processing can be re@@ signed and re@@ produced . the last action can be re@@ signed , by selecting re@@ work or re@@ produced , by selecting re@@ work from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard abbrevi@@ ation , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to restore and to restore C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer the &amp; L@@ MB ; you can get a moment longer in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions between also made and re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation devices in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to store them . &quot;
you can use in the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the menu bar .
&quot; to adjust a photo at the window size , you can use this button in the tool bar : select the enlargement factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full screen mode indicates the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view , where you don &apos;t want to use the Es@@ c button . normally , you can change this in the installation dialog by &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; you can see this in the context dialog box . see this section for setting up the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image and get the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single pictures or entire phr@@ ases . all image files can be printed from your selection . you have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album , if you follow the wi@@ z@@ ard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which is important information and promotions for the selected pictures . the same side bar is available , also available in the image processing ; it will be displayed if one of the five riders are cli@@ cked : &quot;
&quot; multiple times click on the same rider , the side@@ bar will appear and disappear again in the edge . &quot;
&quot; in the labelling view , you can insert labelling with unlimited size or insert . note the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields which allows you to be used by other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and use special characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications .
&quot; after you comments , use either the button user or switch to the next image , the labelling will be saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the user button there is a button More . with this , you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the met@@ ad@@ ata in the files . but this is always done if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata setting that will always be written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the section assessment displays a evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can always be applied to a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard player C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate more images at the same time , select this out and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the sample view shows a search box for filtering the keyword , the sample @-@ tree and a box @-@ box with the previously specified in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; session requested keyword . &quot;
the keyword is dynam@@ ically adapted to the search@@ light . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword fast . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief at the input of keyword in a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot;
keyword can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all tags of the image are stored in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
&quot; if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword , this will only be applied to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter . &quot;
&quot; the side bar code filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - dat@@ or , sample and search results . if in addition , one or more sample filter from the right side is used , only the cut quantity of these two are displayed . all keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also pull and off . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the keyword exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side bar and put it on the selection . therefore , a dialogue that asks you if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the top example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the sample filter is based on no keywords . they were drawn up with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and afterwards there was a keyword from the right hand @-@ tree to the selection and put a dialogue on whether this keyword will be set . &quot;
&quot; this search for changes will take place at any start of the program , too . it can also be switched on settings . &quot;
&quot; if you have a rule with and created , notice that it should be a or should be , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is sought . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , key word , etc . &quot;
&quot; 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can define a Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and next to the button . the options look as follows : &quot;

this article / Tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted to &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; s specific implementation .
&quot; the reason why you set up a color @-@ designed workflow , which can actually get a pre@@ ten@@ able devi@@ ation from the camera or scanners are able to print them from your camera or scanner , like the colors you print or in the web with them from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the theme is on color administration , everyone wants to know which buttons it wants to push for the results that he wants . unfortunately , the sense of this tut@@ orials must provide you with sufficient background information about colour administration . in addition to you , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions . &quot;
&quot; if your image work@@ flows were fulfilled every six below , then you don &apos;t need to take care of color . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( further information can be found below )
&quot; your only other image editions are available via e @-@ mail or web , where is the RGB @-@ de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and the life for everyone makes it easy , why should I use another color space and do you need to make thoughts about color pamp@@ er ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the RGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is shown below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ eder region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB to some larger farms , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms the site , and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to install my monitor if I decided to work only in the RGB color space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in the RGB color space or do not , you need to monitor your monitor , as s@@ RGB needs your monitor . if you are working as a color space of s@@ RGB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool produces five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions standardi@@ zation , equal , automatic and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ise automatic correction automatically try to make the best of your colors . you &apos;ll need to experiment with these effects , to see which works best at your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method is scalable for the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its color sha@@ des . this function is frequently a Mag@@ ical correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; in the same way : this method is adjusted the illumin@@ ating factor of the image of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the Int@@ ens@@ ity affects the same number of pixels . sometimes this is a very powerful operation , which causes either miracle in a picture or destroyed . &quot;
&quot; automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ o@@ ese area . &quot;
&quot; contrast increases : this method improves contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a picture by post@@ p@@ one of the lowest and highest values in the highest possible area and a re@@ turn@@ out of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images , and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the Weiß@@ clu@@ e of &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white image of a photos .
&quot; the White @-@ like Cor@@ rection is somewhat limited to a color space with 8 @-@ bit color . if you can continue to perform a colour space with 8 bits per color , if you can perform the white image in rough mode , which can be used in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white bal@@ m @-@ bal@@ m of ur@@ anium , protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start the menu entry colors white like the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the front window can be adjusted in size . on the left , both the original picture can be adapted as well as the preview of the target image . if you want to see the original whit@@ ish settings , then it is enough to click on the bottom window . &quot;
the preview of the Ziel@@ ona has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the slopes below this marker is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; to the right top is a hist@@ ogram displayed that dynam@@ ically changed , once you have a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lighted images that is displayed very small L@@ umin@@ ance values . with one button you can choose if one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . the sum will be called L@@ umin@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on sha@@ dows , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow end of your photos or down . &quot;
&quot; at the above controls , you should use the color temperature Pi@@ p@@ ette . press the button on this button and then click on the picture preview for the calculation of color temperature of the white balance . on this type , the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white image with the default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ load capacities enhances the colors when more than a colour channel of the pist@@ ol is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in the white image . this will be shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
buttons save as and store make it exactly this . every setting of the white arrow that you have set to store in a text file and re@@ charge later .
&quot; the button pre@@ ferences sets all the filter values back to their standard values , and the corresponding neutral white ratio . note that you can also be able to show neutral settings as your original . if you store them , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can set the code depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the far widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high quality images . this coding requires even more record field , calculation time and stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IFF and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour ton@@ mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for using color profiles . a detailed instructions for the use of color profiles can draw the chapter color administration .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to save multiple color channels at the same time , allowing you to make them the same mistakes and therefore you will always need the same error . in the manual for sound correction , please find further information . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool of gra@@ dation that you can find under colours gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; tool Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ects provides four colour effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of the chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ an , a effect that was created when one partially developed pressure on a short flash light and the colour was protected by the second lighting . this tool was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; intensity control the Solar@@ isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows the image chem@@ ically possible . another increase is finally created a negative image that is not being produced on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of the solar panel . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined intensity ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ Effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it out many photos .
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on daylight , converted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrast . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated fats are also some photographer , especially those of which hardly any landscapes advent@@ ured . &quot;
the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light to the contrast edges . the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the shooting repet@@ itions the strength of the ne@@ on lights . in large pictures the filter can cause the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color temperature of your photos with the tools in the menu below . once you are satisfied with the results you can use the button O@@ k and you are used .
&quot; if you have a photo of bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too big satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can take a good choice instead of raising the satur@@ ation instead . if you like this result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex mold gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ k@@ ite / contrast / Gamma , the tool is based on the improvement of exposure . even if dialogue on this tool is very complicated , you need only the range of shooting only . specifically the three sh@@ ines below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph@@ s of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , active channel or the selected area . below the graph@@ s , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into the picture and the left side represents the dark and right side of the bright areas . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to make use is to shift the regulator , and make sure it changes the picture . &quot;
&quot; on the right hand , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set , if the hist@@ ogram function with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis , the linear hist@@ ogram of a single column is dominated . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram of a single column is dominated . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic distribution is useful . &quot;
&quot; three controllers : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for medium sounds , frequently called Gam@@ ma@@ c . &quot;
&quot; the three colour twe@@ ez@@ ers can be used in the preview of the original image , to adjust the input of the shadow , middle and bright tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow manual values for each range . there are also two controllers used for each area . it can also be used to evaluate the output values , for example , to create a hidden picture as a background while something else can be seen in the fore@@ ground . &quot;
automatically : this button will automatically set the values automatically depending on the intensity of the image .
&quot; save as and store : with these buttons , the set values stored in the file system and later re@@ charged . Gim@@ p Levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes are automatically adjusted for all sha@@ dows , means and sun tones . enable the colour pi@@ p@@ ette to set the procedure for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
the over@@ bel@@ i@@ cht@@ i@@ an@@ ator option controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixel and indicate that the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only visible in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example for the alignment of the input application applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left , half of the original and the target image is displayed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically based on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
&quot; modification channel : this selection box allows you to connect the channel , which is modified by the module : &quot;
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures featuring a digital camera , the linear mode of a constant colour creates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a spa part to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones are corresponding with dark pro@@ curement , corresponding to the corresponding image pixel . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red mark . if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change , a matching line on the curve is displayed , which is the original value . create a point on this line and move on and off , until the value after your taste is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; save as and store : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . every curve which you created can be stored in the file system and later re@@ loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p Short format . &quot;
&quot; if you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes automatically create the inspection points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and sun tones . turn the colour pi@@ p@@ ette to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
the over@@ bel@@ i@@ cht@@ i@@ an@@ ator option controls all colour channels to indicate over@@ exposed pixel . if it is over@@ exposed in more than one channel you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect on preview only and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ channel . shadow and sun tones was used with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied on the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the mixer bl@@ ender of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or modify the color sha@@ des of the photos .
the channel mixer is another high @-@ developed tool to mix the colour sha@@ des of the images . you can process it from the menu color mixer of the image processing .
&quot; using the can@@ al@@ eting input box , you can select the colour for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note how to adjust the channels with the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be seen for comparison via your own rider . &quot;
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you move this in the picture there is a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to show you the respective color value .
&quot; the controls for the module are right below : regulator for red , green and construction allows you to mix these channels . if you enable L@@ umin@@ ance , the image is particularly convenient if you also use the option of Mon@@ ochro@@ me . this is particularly convenient if you also use the option of mon@@ ochro@@ me . try to reduce the channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a colour comes to a visible noise which occur in the colour channel and whose sound pattern is different in every channel . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion first in which you can reduce the far@@ thing . &quot;
the Save as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any bl@@ ender adjustment can be saved later for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel @-@ channel format .
the over@@ bel@@ i@@ cht@@ i@@ an@@ ator option controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixel and indicate that the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only visible in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel is re @-@ adjusted . it is activated by L@@ umin@@ ance . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the working image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step because color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll@@ ers .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P5 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P5 Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lenti@@ l filter . this looks good for all the scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange film : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with orange lens . this improves landscapes , marine scenes and air photos . so similar to 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) of orange . &quot;
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky @-@ effects and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ light for the day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) red filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour ton@@ ic correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ timi@@ on : creates warm bright and medium sounds while he adds a little cold in the shadow of the shadow . this is very similar to the process of a pressure and re @-@ development in a sep@@ tic pad . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thereby similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture . &quot;
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image , or not , you can look like a painting with an old master , a pop style portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry picture texture can be used for this . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth and three @-@ dimensional texture on the picture .
a paper Tex@@ tu@@ re@@ ff@@ effect has been applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the altered one ( 2 ) . the parameter relief is set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; tool frame , a decorative frame can be added to a picture added . &quot;
&quot; to keep the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photos is no easy task . it is a psychological barrier to keep his attention . this is a psychological barrier to the scatter@@ ing eye . below picture frame , the module can be started out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; type : with this parameter , insert the desired frame type for your image . surrounded by pressing a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white pictures ) , painted it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal place for a button and decor@@ atively add a decorative frame with pattern . &quot;
&quot; width : if the frame is in percent , the width of the frame is limited to 1 % to 50 % . &quot;
&quot; this will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can insert simple to form@@ at@@ ted text in an image of any place . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type text and place it with the mouse . use text excerpt , orientation , color from color space and character set with its characteristics as you need . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . already the picture is ready . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text may be changed until you hit the button &quot; OK &quot; . after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; tool sten@@ cil , you can lay a template on a picture . &quot;
the menu image sten@@ cil to apply in the image processing can be used to insert templates about one image .
&quot; for the template there are no restrictions on size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should be able to add the P@@ NG file size file size . if you want to add your template &apos;s file size , then send an e @-@ mail to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; mail@@ ing@@ list di@@ gi@@ arrived @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folders with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in the folder files . these settings are indicated for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root file has been placed for the sten@@ cils , a tree view appears to reflect the folder structure of the template &apos;s template . the selection of a folder will update the template &apos;s template . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , three buttons are available with which you can change the enlargement factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the next image . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inks : this button shr@@ inks the opposite image . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . if you want to use the template to the whole picture , you need to shr@@ ink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to shift this button to shift below the template . take the picture and place it in the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the template on your image . the image will then be adapted automatic .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; introduces three different tool to shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you have advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool to shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but creates particularly in dark areas , grain images . &quot;
&quot; un@@ shar@@ ehol@@ ding mask is working on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it does not use psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric darkness and it &apos;s a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and he is protected by Win@@ ston Chang . &quot;
&quot; Re@@ focus is probably the best of the three , as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its use and has various parameters for adjust@@ ing . &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized pictures need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is the same phenomenon to be combined with only minimal differences . the same phenomenon is to be printed into a common color . SLR cameras will usually need more and later than normal cameras for the private user .
&quot; at JPEG image , a camera of internal shar@@ pen@@ ing has been applied frequently . in contrast , pictures in the raw format must always be weak@@ ened during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner will take advantage of raising the picture during installation of the image . if you dis@@ able this , check the control over your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can obtain useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with shar@@ pen@@ ing po@@ e@@ ering . you can claim your input with the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; but you should be careful to deal with careful because the results are not very natural : shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fy the noise . in general , you can find it on the menu entry Control Re@@ focus . in general , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too tight . the solution to draw the picture a little soft , is much simpler than it . use the tool for a soft@@ mark with the menu entry Kor@@ rig@@ ize soft and experiment with settings . the presentation of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter un@@ sharp m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove veil@@ s from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original picture and preview can help you edit the image . the printed window shows the output of the film with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values generate very good results and should first be tried out . an increase of the radius or amount rein@@ force the effect . if you create the un@@ shar@@ ks mask to strongly make noise and impression of grass near sharp edges . &quot;
the radius is like many pixels on each side of a edge through the filters . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ ans . they should therefore sharp@@ ens pictures best in their final resolution .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ red picture , which is added to the original . thereby , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the swelling value is a split from the maximum RGB @-@ value and the difference amount . you can define a minimum difference for a edge of the filters . in this way , areas with a soft switch between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore beauty errors are avoided in faces , heavens and water surface areas . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp m@@ asked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture the ( 2 ) . in@@ sharp m@@ asked has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; tool Re@@ focus is focused on a picture through improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ si@@ er@@ en@@ quot ; it is a better approach to shar@@ pen@@ ing the photo . it is a better way to shar@@ pen@@ ing the photo . it is using a technology called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtering . it is using a technology called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ing . it is using a technology called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ing . you can start the menu by using colors re@@ focus in the image processing .
&quot; in practice , the circular tor@@ ch is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ oot . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ ill has a very long tail , which leads far from the source pi@@ x@@ ies that are far away from the original qu@@ eting pixel . the F@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse is influenced by far away from distant pixels . this causes un@@ wanted results . &quot;
&quot; circular ness : this is the radius of the circular line . it is the most important parameters for the use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should be 1 good results . however , you can make a higher value if your picture should be very un@@ sharp then on Heiligen@@ sch@@ a . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arsen@@ ic . the correlation can be reduced from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are equal to 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduced the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the sound filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values can be reduced by 0 @-@ 1 . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will still fail . &quot;
&quot; G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . if you want to avoid this parameter , if you want to avoid an un@@ equal filter . in most cases , you should avoid this value to 0 if you may also increase the correlation coefficient and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformer size . an increase in matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular ness or the pal@@ let &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; the stores as well as loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters that you have set , will be saved for later and then can be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try out all the cutting , colour and intensity correc@@ tions to the image before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible , but later leave un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you read pictures and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp m@@ asked produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by un@@ sharp m@@ asked a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
theore@@ tically it has to produce un@@ sharp m@@ asked always arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of un@@ shar@@ pen . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the un@@ shar@@ pen mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better in processing of small details .
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see : &quot;
the original un@@ clear colour image has to be corrected . this image has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to un@@ sufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for further information about the methods for shar@@ pen@@ al correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
&quot; the regul@@ ators of the deposit uses the un@@ shar@@ ehol@@ ding of the area , to create a more natural po@@ up@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the color tin@@ te allows a customized colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool image in@@ correct is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ sert algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pre@@ ferences than Star@@ points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the default settings are below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the hor@@ semen and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail balance , p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preser@@ vation of details . a smaller value leads to a smooth glass of smooth and details . a value of 0,9 should be easily obtained . please note that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated permanently . please note that the details should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; direction depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly into all directions , while a value close to 1 only can be smooth@@ ed in one direction . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts will be best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore , set this value to the degree of smoke in your image . &quot;
&quot; rule of regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more is being exposed , as it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ent effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repet@@ itions : is there how often the algorithm is going through . usually 1 or 2 are usually sufficient .
&quot; An@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected , it should also be small . make sure that small angles need a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and for your needs acceptable . &quot;
&quot; integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step@@ pes in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel bulbs and never exceed 2 . &quot;
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation Use : the more to quality you get through selection of this option is only low . but he doubled the term . therefore we recommend it to allow him .
buttons save as and store make exactly this . every setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and later re@@ charged .
&quot; image error is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can break the calculation at any time with the button demol@@ ition . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see like image errors with small arti@@ facts . the module is shown on a photo that caused by an analog camera in the fore@@ ground that caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correct image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange . it uses a copyright algorithm by Peter rear .
&quot; this tool provides selectable image filter , to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , remove . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ v ; effects from sc@@ anned pictures from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information about sens@@ ing digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tut@@ orial . &quot;
screen photo above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain in default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is needed for the filter . large values increase the time of the filter per pixel . the image can be spo@@ iled by the radius , and the colour in it is smooth@@ ed and therefore smaller bugs . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the depth of the filter . this value sets the pixel pitch of the filter to the front . if it is increased , cat@@ er@@ ships will be deleted . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can &apos;t get more and noise again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the fil@@ let . if it is too strong can not be removed or cat@@ chers can occur . if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
&quot; density : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve the image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings . &quot;
colour : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to enhance a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; gamma : controls the eff@@ at@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase tolerance values of dar@@ ker areas , which typically tend to increase stronger . however , it also raises the shadow segments . &quot;
&quot; damp@@ ing : controls the alignment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ m@@ esh damp@@ ing . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges may appear . if it is too high , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can appear at the edges . it can remove noise and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; store under and loading : these buttons are used precisely for this . all parameters for space reduction that you have set , can be stored in the file system and then re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of how noise reduction can change your lives . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) , and the measured value was marked with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; sometimes a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture . use the tool for a soft@@ mark with the menu entry Kor@@ rig@@ ize soft and experiment with the gl@@ ass@@ le . the front look at the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo@@ species file .
&quot; this filter for rest@@ oring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ irable art@@ e@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adjusted to dive into digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digit@@ ised pictures to remove film archit@@ ec@@ tures , scrat@@ ches , compression charts and local errors that makes the content as it also makes the human eye . &quot;
the same algorithm can be used for colour@@ ing and tex@@ turing . the tex@@ turing is developed using a different tool that was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ya and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas it even produces several Com@@ pres@@ sions &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ e@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed picture . this setting is supposed to correct this problem .
buttons save as and store make exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce the picture of a picture with a DC ( TM ) 700@@ Si camera to an Il@@ ford ( TM ) 700@@ Si camera with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gra@@ zing on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
&quot; this time , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures can be found on an old color photo that was created with a scanner . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the photo image is below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; tools Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel of photos that have been protected with a CCD camera , eight were to remove . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , total or hot pixels are especially suitable for high quality raw quality photos , because many cameras with JPEG compression is equipped with JPEG compression via a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and quot ; bright pixel quot ; there are currently no manual method to choose the bad pixel .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the dark picture . the tool will recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture shows .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to discover the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by a CCD defect . &quot;
&quot; first described , as described in the previous section , you should find the appropriate dark image to the correct image . please note that the assistant does not notice the last dark image and automatically re@@ charge this in the next session . &quot;
the picture area and the preview can help you correct within the image . the printed window shows the output of the film with the current settings . poor pixels are highlighted in all fore@@ front areas .
select an area around the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing this pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; Dur@@ ation : an average of the neighbouring cells is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ects in the block . for 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels have a distance of 1 from the pixel block to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the defective pixel block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the defective pixel .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera to see a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fier correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net , i.e. under@@ cut corners , one image . &quot;
&quot; wide @-@ angle lens , in particular the middle and large photo format , often cannot illumin@@ ate the entire sensor zone . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sha@@ ken ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that can reduce the sensor there . Tel@@ e@@ facts will also demonstrate this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he has also dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor 1,5 or 2 in the blood filter which should use the necessary sealing time under circumstances which is impossible to use the camera with hand . wide angle lenses , also with center filter , an opening of f / 16 or less , otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen effects are created by movement . &quot;
&quot; using the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color scanner and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter using an equivalent transformation into a raw image that has been applied without these filters . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three reg@@ ders , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fier correction filter and three further the exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light power cushi@@ oning at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in a optical filter with a bl@@ ending adjustment of 2 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of Vig@@ ia , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; leu@@ k@@ starch , contrast and gamma settings : editing a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fier correction is reduced the brightness of the target image . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options , as you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a more sensitive new adjustment of the target image , you let the values for lumin@@ ous / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fier correction on a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . a leu@@ cine and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; Lin@@ sen@@ dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses to photos . it uses a copyright algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion . colour dist@@ ortion cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree is treating the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or conv@@ ex form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect , fl@@ att@@ ened to the edges . this correction is not used in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of the fourth degree is set the distant corners to the second degree of degree . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion can be eliminated almost eliminated . &quot;
generally : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion second degree . with negative values can be corrected and cut positive values .
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion . this value is stronger in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenti@@ ls , the &apos; corners parameter is the reverse of the parameter General . &quot;
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and leads through a correc@@ ting first degree of degree . negative values enlarge while positive the picture decreased .
brigh@@ test : this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the picture in the corners while positive values increase .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview of the dist@@ ortion correction . the values you use for your image will be stored and used as standard values . &quot;
the tonn@@ e or ris@@ ky correction should be performed before all conc@@ ision - or size changes . if you are best to cut this correction as all of the first . if you have a picture new and then it would seem to be an effect of the effect of the Fal@@ se .
&quot; to help you find the best correction to help you find this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this site . in the connection , you can correct the tonn@@ e / co@@ d dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you have a glass @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion , the resulting picture is black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu transform@@ ers out of the image processing or via the zoom control of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures the volume @-@ shaped correction is made . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as recordings from the front , frames and paintings are the perspective so correct , if you keep the camera with hand you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the lat@@ en@@ ical correction to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ enn@@ as and org website which is available under this URL . filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left window of the window , you can select the range for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can consider the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the preview of preview , you can sim@@ ulate two parameters of film @-@ grain and film sensitivity ( ISO ) if you want to sim@@ ulate the grain texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator is changing the amount of film grains and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter channels to produce a infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos , as the colour information are missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ fil@@ o filter on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the working image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type of au@@ ra in the top .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; filter film body is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film grains on your pictures . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films the manufacturer great silver grain of the photo@@ emul@@ sion .
&quot; the film effect effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want to get a tim@@ eless atmosphere of everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ ined appearance especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , so you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , at ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the film agent attached to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) , which used film sensitivity to ISO @-@ 1600 . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like a oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controllers to influence this effect . the upper one cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thick brush are better suited for large pictures . smooth controlled the gl@@ ands or , from the other side look out , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and it is marked with the ( 2 ) . pin size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and Gl@@ ance 17 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; Filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a coal @-@ tip . images whose gra@@ dient are under@@ going slowly . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing . they would have chosen to sk@@ etch out what scene you would have chosen to start you . this would be good pictures to start .
&quot; there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 , to control this effect . the upper regulator select the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( gl@@ are ) . &quot;
this is an example of the charcoal filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjust@@ ing the intensity value .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D when it was stamped on wax . it uses a copyright algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , where color does not use the most important in content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the picture into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ed landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo in a work of art using dist@@ ortion @-@ effects . it uses protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave blocks 1 : share the picture in cells and looks like if it is viewed by gl@@ ass@@ blocks .
&quot; wave blocks 2 : analog to the shaft , the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can break this effects at any time using the button .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo in a work of art using un@@ shar@@ pen effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
zoom shar@@ pen : wi@@ ped the picture along st@@ ern@@ ing lines run from a centre . this sim@@ ulates a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
Radi@@ al In@@ shar@@ k : wi@@ ped the picture by rotation of the pixels around a centre . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ ehol@@ ding of a swi@@ vel camera .
distance shar@@ k : wi@@ ped the picture to produce the effect of a non @-@ focused camera sis . the object seems to go back into the background .
&quot; movement of movement : wi@@ ped the picture by horizontal movements of pixel . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ pen of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera . &quot;
&quot; soft@@ ness un@@ shar@@ pen : wi@@ red the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos , or to add a warm and subtle light . &quot;
sho@@ ot@@ shar@@ k : wi@@ ped the image through random shifting of the pixels and sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ k of a moving camera .
intelligent un@@ shar@@ k : finds the color basin in the image and wi@@ ped out these without the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , through the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time using the button .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops onto your image . this gives it natural your pictures a nice look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ur@@ anium protected algorithm .
dri@@ pping size allows to change the size of the drops . because the drop @-@ size doesn &apos;t get automatically with the size of the image . number changes the number and density of drops . fish changes the optical effect of the drop in the picture .
&quot; you can keep using the &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe ; create a range free of shelves . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter shelves will remain free from rain@@ drops . &quot;
this is an example of the drop @-@ drop filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) suggests a sunset over a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through sk@@ e@@ wers or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ers and transform@@ ers sk@@ e@@ wers . &quot;
photo v@@ ases is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is simple . the big question is , how can you find a painting bub@@ bles and the details are sharp ? how can you find the missing information ? how can I find the missing information here ? how can I find the missing information here ? how can you find the missing information here . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it on the desired size with the size size . select transform@@ ational size changes in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm has been developed by IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
&quot; if this setting is activated , the aspect ratio is retained in the original ratio of the original ratio . &quot;
&quot; rule of regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is being exposed , as it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the buttons save as and store are used exactly . each st@@ ale for photo can be saved as text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot;
photo bub@@ bles is very quickly with what it makes but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can break the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below a picture for photo v@@ ases by removing a small colour image on the double size . the original ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) is the result of the linear standard enlarged comparison .
&quot; cutting of a photos is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . the image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse , pressing the mouse button and move to the rectangle . you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you get rid of the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off . by doing so , you can change the size of the cutting area by removing the corners of the rectangle . create a new rectangle with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting section , use the button The Zu@@ pping de button of the image processing in the tool bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file to store or file to save the new Photo file . &quot;
&quot; you can change the size of the rectangle by shifting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in dialogue remains . &quot;
&quot; depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of the height is assigned to the width and in the width of the width . &quot;
&quot; the tool to cut side@@ ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always equal to whether you can use centi@@ meters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to connect the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can set the Max . ratio button to the cutting on the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool to cut side @-@ ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data reflect the copied picture and not the original picture . &quot;
you allow help to get into the settings of coll@@ ateral assistance to make your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ious particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third par@@ agus are harmon@@ ious triangles a way to share a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ious triangles .
golden Middle : the golden middle is a partition which pattern on various natural growth pattern such as the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus shell or the pet@@ als of a sunflower . it emerg@@ es in all possible things that we feel as beautiful .
&quot; the golden partition is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you have already used the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built up your temples and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you create your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is heads off by the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i eps . 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . , where every number after 1 is the sum of their two preceding figures , the resulting divi@@ der is as a visual harmon@@ ious . &quot;
the golden middle provides liquid support lines when you set a picture . these help are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring your goal good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ third party , the golden spiral of the eye can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads to the view of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual river . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles should be used to create the golden spiral . that can be a line or different objects . this can be easily done without the eye , it will be able to fulfill his task . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angle are also rec@@ alled by the golden spiral . its ver@@ tex points are the middle points of the golden rectangle . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angular , golden triangles are no uniform triangles . diagonal to this lines can be reached a static object of dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden triangles in order to break your frames you create a effect of a professional photographer dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach .
the options Horizont@@ al mir@@ ro@@ red and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ious particles .
&quot; using the button color , you can setting the color of the help lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to turn a picture of any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to fix the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where things are shot at an angle ; image processing and tool free rotation . select transform@@ ers free rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . you can set the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right .
&quot; to help your help , the module is available in a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture @-@ look around the two lines . now you can adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you shot a picture , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair it is the function transformation cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function Autom@@ atically . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after rotation . note the above warning .
all per@@ sever@@ ance trans@@ forms are performed for a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you must use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be calculated automatically . on the right side of dialogue you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new heights : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left top : displays the current angle in degrees along the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right : displays the current angle in degrees along the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjust@@ ing the perspective the picture becomes a little bit dar@@ ed . for single adjustment , this effect is small but two adjustments will generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after completing the perspective , you get unbe@@ atable tri@@ angular holes to the corners . a possibility to ber@@ some is the picture with transform@@ ing cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the sc@@ oring tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite side . this is no rotation , the picture becomes dist@@ orted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . with other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transform@@ ers . &quot;
check your picture by using the Horizont@@ al angle and the vertical angle . you can push horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you push the angle to zero . a preview of Eff@@ ort@@ ations will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the presentation area .
&quot; to your help you get a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall from a building on your image and pressing the left mouse button to adjust the lines to adjust your picture . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the shot , the picture will be a bit dar@@ ken@@ ed . for a single shot , this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two ch@@ ings em@@ itted twice as much dis@@ ruption and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after switching the picture , the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is cut the picture with transform@@ ing cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , by the type of these libraries comp@@ lies . in most distri@@ butions , you can edit a large number of image formats with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; based on other libraries , it is impossible to give up a list of all the file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and T@@ IFF among them . &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; displays only files in formats . this is done using file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension came to the list . you can accept this list of file extensions ; you can accept this list of file extensions . in the section configuration you will find more information .
&quot; virtually all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IFF . some cameras allow you to choose to use format . a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia , and supports both formats . &quot;
&quot; image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . in this way , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results as JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also store loss @-@ free if this is indicated in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the resource format , you can read more about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find Roh@@ format pictures in JPEG or T@@ IFF with the raw image Converter of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you can find further information on the use of modules with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; supports the load of raw pictures only by the program d@@ cra@@ w that comes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; they can see more than 200 raw file formats . all of them support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave &apos;s coffee . the table below shows a short list of raw materials that are supported by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; supported :
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG @-@ format , but does not understand these formats and does not have any built @-@ in movies . if you click on a film file &amp; read it ; the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings to play movies use to play the program for playback . &quot;

K@@ IP@@ I module is a series of images to be exported into a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth .
&quot; if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do good if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can hold the first four Adjust@@ ments with the White module . &quot;
many tools you need the photo@@ machining are included in &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; their description follows here .
&quot; all educational processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , so@@ ftw@@ ood , shr@@ ink , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp m@@ asked , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialogue type that is applied to the actual picture before the filter is applied to the current image . below , you can see &amp; quot ; texture : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . to the left , five buttons allow the compar@@ ative mode of the front area . these modes are : &quot;
vertically share without dup@@ lic@@ at . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the fields right of the selected proposal .
&quot; horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ at . the upper range shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected proposal . &quot;
vertically split . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the film .
horizontal parts . the upper area shows the original and the lower part of the film &apos;s effect .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the press section and otherwise the original .
2 ) : there are two buttons on which you can turn off to show over and under@@ pin . the used colors can be adapted in the general integration page .
( 3 ) : the frame for the preview of the preview . you can pull this frame with the mouse within the image and click on the part of the image from which you want to see . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left bottom right : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all adjustment from the last use of the module will be noticed .
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information on the selected image and is largely expl@@ ain@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters in shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider is available an intuitive ant@@ it@@ iner@@ tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini program . press C@@ tr@@ l . push the mouse button to pull out a square . remove all pictures within this coordinates must be filtered and displayed . this will naturally contain your pictures ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used for machining of color pal@@ ettes and to choose from colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; K@@ DE , can either be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; K@@ DE ; settings and hot user defined colours . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog range , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is shown in the Pal@@ etten@@ view as line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows on the color of it . the colour is described below the pal@@ let view . here also the color name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to choose from . to create a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor position . then move the mouse with pressing mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is inserted under the button color , the paint is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color will be inserted either or ski@@ pped another ; depending on whether the mode is selected , you can adjust the check box below at Bei@@ m cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cut and insert . &quot;
&quot; &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color , three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by another color . if there are three numer@@ ical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , this can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and output of colour selection can be drawn with the mouse .
&quot; choose a paint somewhere on the screen , and then you can find in the colour of the colour on the left . &quot;
&amp; graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Graph@@ s ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , particularly in computer science . the programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z . programs that include : - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only few functions . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; cable viewer ; the project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well @-@ integrated &amp; K@@ DE , program . &quot;
&amp; c@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Graph@@ s ; -@@ Programs are free layout programs . &amp; c@@ graph viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program in a modern and user friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the graph@@ s are re@@ calculated and in &amp; c@@ graph viewer ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; to open or open the graph@@ s in &amp; box ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ Compon@@ ent
load of large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these knots )
additional needed software : &amp; c@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; program which anticip@@ ates the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; required for the presentation of graph@@ s .
&quot; the main window displays the open graph@@ s , each in an own under@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewers ; without another argument , the main window will open only the symbol file and open the ( empty ) list . Click on the first icon to display the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have chosen one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview of the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressing &amp; Alt ; button ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction in graph@@ s .
&quot; if the file has just changed in &amp; c@@ graph@@ viewers ; loaded file from another program , the following window will appear : &quot;
&quot; you can choose if the graph is to be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change , or if you want to change your decision , so you can also change your choice , so you can set up the menu settings settings ; set up ... use , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you can open a graph@@ s outside of a running &amp; video viewer ; instance , eg ; in file browser or at the command line , you have to open the option if you want to open a new &amp; video viewer ; -@@ instance , or want to display the graph@@ s in a sub @-@ window of the ongoing instance . &quot;
&quot; as in the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also to change this with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the start of program , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as later . &quot;
&quot; you can also set up , how the graph should be split up to multiple sites . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen . &quot;
&quot; if you use several sites , you can select whether the parts of the graph@@ s are to be changed on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; side view with one on several sites , graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font &quot;
&quot; once again , the opportunity to determine the behavior when a file has been changed on the hard disk , and eg ; from another program . you can define a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore any changes ) or the program every time . &quot;
&quot; the page opening gives the opportunity to determine the behaviour of &amp; c@@ graph@@ viewers ; determine if a graph is open outside a running session , you can open a standard behaviour in a new window or determine that each time is requested . &quot;
&quot; the site seating management gives the opportunity to determine the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewers ; you can open a default behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) , or determine , at each start . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which usually appear at a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up further possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ ically ; layout algorith@@ ms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ ically ; are :
&quot; &amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for ge@@ aring graph@@ s . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or historical represent@@ ations of the graph@@ s . the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to right ) and then attempts to produce as short edges and as possible as few cant@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ equal graph@@ s . it produces images according to the spr@@ ing@@ time model . it is used by the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional scal@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ ed model layout . it uses the Fru@@ its @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ ry , and includes a multi @-@ point trig@@ gers for the treatment of large and ge@@ clu@@ stered graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the node circular , according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multi @-@ cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by shell command , and the calculated layout of the graph@@ s after st@@ out in x@@ dot format can be issued , and the calculated layout of graph@@ s after st@@ out in x@@ dot format should be able to change or modify the graph@@ s with a filter before being drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph@@ s ( directed or done ) and turns the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for effective graph@@ s ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides images to read and en@@ rich new pictures .
this module can be used to invite new images to read and enhance external sources . currently two sources can be used :
&quot; scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner which supports through the s@@ ane project , or another source like video streams . so that this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and s@@ ane installed . &quot;
&quot; if you scan a picture of the menu entry , a dialogue that allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fet@@ ch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace the default value duc@@ tive own . see the preview of your needs to select your image . the estimated file size will be shown you in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information . &quot;
&quot; note that the window is completely displayed , since some settings otherwise may not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to fixed the options of the target image . please note that the type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore create very large files . you will also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 folder or create the image files . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add to the met@@ ad@@ ata of a picture and edit the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF sample of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization manufactures tools to loc@@ alize images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system , used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and lat@@ itude are used . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data , you need a GPS track in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download the data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
&quot; select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and call up the menu . to download a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to upload a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains the back of the same time at the same time as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , automatic correlation is carried out in red . GPS track data will be recorded at GMT time and therefore the camera time must be carried out with the GMT . this can be carried out using the time zone . here , you will set your camera zone . &quot;
the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a top devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . the devi@@ ation is to be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no track data from one place for pictures you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the images . the time difference between 2000 seconds is then cor@@ related to all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have any appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS can be set up here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog can only use the button OK to set the data on the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found with the shown map and set it . select the relevant region and increase it again . you can always select it again through , until you can always select a reaching accuracy . the card can always be selected between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are ways to hang GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported to HTML pages , and select the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is encoded UTF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the module has four Reiter in which the settings can be adapted to the settings . the riders will only select any albums . you don &apos;t need to select this albums . with the three buttons on the right , you &apos;ll need to select a large number of albums . in the area below , the pages will appear in the head of the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for any page . this rider is largely explic@@ able . this rider is displayed on each image a page in which the image will be displayed in the image . otherwise , the picture will be shown directly with your default picture , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed &quot;
&quot; the rider record defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images . choose a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything will be created there . &quot;
&quot; in case you have chosen the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . of course , the file size is also explained . all other settings are in@@ explic@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the rider , allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album rider for the pictures , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window displays the user as far as the action is . press off to break down the process .
&quot; if the module created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages when the web browser will automatically start to display the preview of the gallery . press the web browser to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL basic tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I imag@@ ined allows to look at a selection of pictures and perform on them basic operations like tor@@ ches , zo@@ oming or shifts . the viewer can use short commands and folders . it has been developed for a fast image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture will be displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss@@ less module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows to store pictures in JPEG format , without the usual losses on quality and met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is the file size , because no compression of the colour information is taking place . this is also found at P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing these messages please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module met@@ ad@@ ata Editor is currently no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy the data from a picture to another . please select the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data is copied after you click on the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please refer to ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG coding module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in form of a seal .
&quot; the MPEG co@@ di@@ ers module can be used to add selected images in a MPEG video , using a defined length , to convert the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . between the different images , you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ ameter . &quot;
&quot; all images will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can use a background colour for Di@@ ameter . with this module it is possible to create a DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / VCD file for your DVD player . to burn the media , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you first have to packed the images that are packed into MPEG Di@@ ameter . after that you can create about ex@@ tras m@@ asch@@ au the module .
&quot; the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there , you can also change sorting of the pictures or the contents of the list . &quot;
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and VCD . PAL is pre@@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the picture below is defined among them . a low value is produced very sudden , a high level of very smooth picture changes . &quot;
&quot; the background colour can be set as next . in doubt , you should set them black . on the name and the path of the generated file you can design@@ ate the name of the MPEG output file . keep it possible to mp@@ g . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the film . after you can adjust all settings your wishes , you can easily drink or drink the production of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now be able to drink a coffee and enjoy the seal back when you return . &quot;
&quot; if an indication appears that co@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages on the right below . &quot;
&quot; the printer driver allows to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo@@ sizes . this can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is , for example , to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your images stored in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ link tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave coffee in . a original quote by Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it is the same results as the software from your camera makers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted and restart the module . the Ra@@ w image Converter window appears in mode for a single picture . with the button preview , you can consider the effect of your current settings . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for the white image . the essential parameters like gamma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can continue to edit the image later on . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so you can use the contrast information . if your camera is in the RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches does not work . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a non @-@ loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged image format , T@@ IFF , ret@@ ains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you have imag@@ ined your pictures frequently or you later to use otherwise , you do not select the JPEG format because it &apos;s only a limited number of operations . T@@ IFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata is stored in the RA@@ W file in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information . &quot;
&quot; if you are adapted to your settings , you can start converting the conversion . if you want to break this process again , you can break down . &quot;
&quot; the stack @-@ processing mode allows you to convert different images to once . use this mode , therefore , for example , by testing on a single image that are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have to write the possibility of existing file automatically . however , this is useful if this in an earlier attempt is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of a album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number , and tim@@ est@@ amp . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image smaller or enlarge . in addition , four types of the image change are provided : &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image will automatically be selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 2 dim@@ mer . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to screen size . &quot;
non @-@ proportional : proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed in this option .
&quot; preparation : preparing the image for photo print . the user can set up the printing solution and the size of the photo tables . the target image , including background size , boundary size and background colour is adapted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected pictures to your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of sending images in advance . more pictures can be taken on the list of sending images and place there . &quot;
&quot; after you started the module , the pictures window frames can be displayed on the selected images . adding a file selection dialog for more images . for the last selected image will be shown a preview on the right @-@ hand side . &quot;
you can also pull pictures on the picture list and add it to the list of sen@@ ing images .
&quot; with the button pictures , the selected pictures from the list of sen@@ sel@@ fish pictures are removed . &quot;
&quot; after you have chosen all images , you can open the new message window to your e @-@ mail clients . you &apos;ll need to add the addresses and regarding the subject . these images are already added as app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
don &apos;t pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the E @-@ Mail window is used to change the settings for sending of the images . their configuration is stored and each time you will change it until you change them .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the right path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you &apos;ll need to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download this here . &quot;
&quot; after the comments of comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the loss @-@ free formats such as T@@ IFF . you should therefore have P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG image format and select the original files in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the pictures below . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status notification , while searching for errors . your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button , you can see this window fl@@ lie ? &quot;
&quot; after starting the module advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions such as you want to see your Di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL upgrade option is activ@@ ates very elegant image trans@@ itions by Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the Di@@ ameter will be very slow . &quot;
the file names indicate that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the pictures in the left @-@ left corner is displayed during the presentation .
the loop option indicates that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can then break it manually with Es@@ c .
the pictures accid@@ entally select that the pictures are displayed in an accid@@ ental order . so it will not be the order of the pictures in the album .
below delay between the pictures can be set the tim@@ ely distance between the different images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen over@@ transition effect . so you should point out the presentation to your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly cho@@ oses in each transition between the pictures a different effect .
&quot; during the Di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar on the upper left screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch you . &quot;
&quot; with this tool bar , you can hold the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
&quot; on the left bottom screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool to set up an image as background image for the user interface .
&quot; this module sets the current selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menus , as a background for your K@@ DE work . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; photo album ; through this browser , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , are now available in any group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you can see the following categories as you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look at the folder structure on your hard drive and look at the current presentation images . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser changed . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person only the images are displayed , on which both persons are visible . through this selection method , you can limit the number of images displayed by some thousand pictures on a few pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view the images of your real range . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can store with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person a self @-@ looking picture , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories which you have defined . see this picture . &quot;
&quot; to show pictures next to the name , select the button that you want to set right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with pictures of persons and simultaneously a list of keyword ( if you don &apos;t have any appropriate pictures ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must set the picture to select the image for each individual person . in order to do this , you &apos;ll need to select the picture @-@ image window ( in closer ) and select the image for the corresponding person . in the pine@@ al window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which portion of the image can be cut or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you call in the main window &apos;s main window , you &apos;ll find a dialog displayed in the dialog for the fixed image properties . this dialog can view you on the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a string in the field of let@@ tering or description , the labelling and descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date after the text ; for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here is shown according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read books , but rather like to try hand@@ books , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; photo album ; and look at the quick entry to screen photos and introduc@@ tory videos .
&quot; start &amp; watch photo album ; and select the first dialog on the demo , in case you start &amp; photo album ; first time , or select the menu entry into the menu entry . therefore , some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; photo album ; try out . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you &apos;ll find it on the homepage of &amp; photo album ; as a related HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this surro@@ unds you see here : how the name suggests that this surro@@ unds you date information about the pictures in your database .
&quot; the time bar can show you several different units . each case shows another unit . you can switch between the units for years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by pressing the ly@@ re only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the time bar can be inter@@ actively used in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , you will always see the first picture of this date in the preview picture ) and also the time bar shows the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview list . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the time bar , so the sched@@ ules are displayed . if you select a range , you &apos;ll just view images of this time in preview . you can click the selection by clicking on a beam of time bar . &quot;
&amp; photo album ; gives you two options to create HTML websites with your images . the one is integrated in &amp; photo album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user &apos;s book is described in &amp; photo album ; built in &amp; photo album ; you can call on the HTML menu .
&quot; before HTML pages , you have to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and goal . in the following , each field is described more precisely . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of over@@ bli@@ cks and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on photo album ; HTML example page , you see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; photo album will be created ; export file is to be seen on the over@@ sight . nour@@ ishing information about export files you will find in . &quot;
&quot; last , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid that information is exported from a party . for example , you can &apos;t use any pictures of a party . for example , you can &apos;t use this attitude to hide specific images from certain amount . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can define how the HTML page should look like . most import@@ ation possibilities are unique , which is why not especially received . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures . therefore , those who have to consider your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x@@ 600 , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; at any time , the viewer can change the resolution at any time you can change your pictures with lower resolution , which leads to a lower transmission period , as well . when he wants to get a larger image larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this installation area , place the various folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , select a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you have to select the main file , in which all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and select the location next time . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if they are really all visible for viewing . if you have created a URL for the basic folder . the URL , which you set here , should restart this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong file . &quot;
&quot; in the case that the files created by you are not able to copy them in the final destination folder . thus , the import function , see , correctly , you need to specify the final destination of the files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folder are located . &quot;
&quot; the installation possibilities just described , all three are related to basic folders or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder was created whose name will set you into output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking forward to a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo album ; you may want to add a HTML page to look at images , recording location , etc . , you &apos;ll need to add a HTML @-@ page on the pictures , recording location , etc . , do not have to do this work once again . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others in your database . the image characteristics are imported with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im -@@ files , internal and external . they differ in the file itself , whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file , or if you have all the pictures into the file , that you can merge all the pictures into the file , however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the menu file , or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two times . first searches the images that have been found in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is , of course , the images of the URL , which you have created when creating your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML @-@ export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialogue is described for the export of images which you can export about the File menu ... call . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three selection options are available :
&quot; for manu@@ ell near the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the Autom@@ atically option , a copy of the .@@ k@@ im file is copying &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files if you want to comp@@ ress the export file .
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send your friends pictures , you want to limit the pictures maybe in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be 800 pixel high and wide . &quot;
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file imports ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database is described as described in .
&quot; the assistant to imports consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which file the import images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it can be that you are to person@@ alise the category persons of the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is required for your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialogue window , which are to be imported in the third dialogue window , which correspond to these categories , in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can like the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . one example , for this you see on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse the pictures and look at : if you see pictures , you often want to watch pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend to discover , you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you &apos;ll find the various steps of ( 1 ) fixed information on your pictures , via ( 2 ) the looking and look at ( 3 ) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been released as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it will take care of your videos . at many places in this manual it will be talking about pictures , but often this also makes videos with one . &quot;
&amp; photo album ; saves all his information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . it is a simple XML file that you can copy to a disk or revisions in CV@@ S as you want .
&amp; photo album ; not@@ ices a folder in which your pictures are stored and used this in future start @-@ up . if you want to start a different folder in &amp; c@@ photo@@ album . if you want to start a different folder with pictures you can start &amp; photo album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : the photo album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
&quot; Click on the menu entry settings ; set up ... enter a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo album ; in the following section of the user manual are explained to you the different integration possibilities . &quot;
&quot; on the left , you can see six different symbols with which you can call installation options of preview and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call through a button on the F1 button and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it was described to you how you can define various properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; watch the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a lab@@ eling and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ categories were already mentioned in the section . in the dialog options , you can set up complete members of members , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a centre of Mitt@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the list of setup possibilities , you can choose to configure the member groups . with the top selected selection list , you can choose the category you want to configure . in the left window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; photo album ; share its modular system with other graphic applications such as di@@ gi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plug@@ in interface . Click on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be called over the menu modules . the modules can be described and are not described in this manual , because they are not part of &amp; photo album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call via the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules used by several applications can be used together , it can be that the modules are always tested with the demo file ; therefore , you should use new modules always using the demo @-@ database with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . do not say , I have not warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use modules about K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; photo album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with various applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are brows@@ ing their pictures in albums : this type of order is not supported , sim@@ ulate it for some modules the order after albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; sim@@ ulate &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the current album , which is simply the current view , so all images that show you the picture at the moment . &quot;
&quot; next to the current album , &amp; photo album has to be released ; the modules also has a list of albums . here goes &amp; photo album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; photo album ; s browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; the category you &apos;ve specified in the dialog dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you use the category for example , your photo album will be done , so if you would choose to add people to the view and continue to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; photo album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the installation dialog and select the modules , which modules are to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you can see an example for a start screen as soon as you start &amp; your photo album ; start your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and one tool bar . below the tool bar you can see the window that you can &apos;t have any information about your pictures . in the section , we will display no information about your pictures . in the section , we will show you the image below , which shows you an overview of all existing pictures . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each image with notes . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , where the image has been recorded either individually or for a larger number of images . if shown on all images of Jes@@ per , and all pictures in Copenhagen have been recorded . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for searching and brows@@ ing , as you can read in the section , if you want to see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; in you can see three lists with a text field , by clicking on people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo album ; since you will always be able to re@@ use it for information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on the shift of pictures within the list . if you are depicted for example a family party , and at all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be post@@ pon@@ ed , you can find that the names are post@@ pon@@ ed upwards to find persons faster and arrange . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to read a alphabetical list , click on the icon for sorting under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen notes on each image individually , you might be able to edit any selected pictures and have this pictures with notes . in this case simply click on the front and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture right up . &quot;
&quot; if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , it can be more comfortable to mark all these pictures and select the menu of multiple entries once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you &apos;ll see an browser window of the USA as a group . in order to show you that it is a special symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the corporate dialog@@ s , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also get an entry to a category and place there to make this entry in alphabetical order that you just sort your categories in alphabetical order . &quot;
&quot; you can post@@ p@@ one the single elements of the log @-@ dialog@@ s by forming the tops of the frame , click and post@@ p@@ one . you can make up a window as well as a window by taking it out of the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , you can click with the settings , click on the button options ... which allows you to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also use a frame also completely . if you want to see this window later again , use the button options ... and here you can see a / out window . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in your browser , you will receive an overview of images of the currently selected images , or all images in case you have no filters . an example you can see the size of the pictures , by simply after drag the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it easy . &quot;
&quot; if you leave an image on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this picture is displayed in the picture . if you have no window with a picture file , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures from the imag@@ ery . simply select the corresponding images from which you want to delete and press either the delete button or select in the menu Edit menu . now , you will see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&amp; photo album ; it offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use the photos stored on your hard disk . in the picture you &apos;ll need to have the pictures anywhere in the database . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; photo album ; if not all required pictures of the hard disk can be loaded .
&quot; images , where the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 , however , the pictures are available , so that &amp; photo album ; you can view the preview of these pictures . you can also view these pictures with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you want to see this function , you need to copy files from the folders and click into it again . if you want to avoid trouble , like the m@@ ess of your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you filter the pictures that you can see for others and click on the current view . alternatively , you can see all images that can see your little sister , control and unlock the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; thus , you have set what images will be hidden in case of the case . if you unlock the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , allowing all the images you &apos;d be locked . if you want to see the pictures again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to recon@@ struct a password , which must be entered to un@@ locking the images . to set this password , you can simply change password in the privacy . &quot;
&quot; please remember that this image protection is not very safe if you can read or delete all the pictures on the hard disk and to the other , this type of password protection can only read or delete this type of password protection ; not very familiar with the view to the private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; photo album ; manage and hours over hours to describe them , of course , that you want to look at some point . for this reason &amp; photo album ; over one image _ and video viewer . you can start this preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in view . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you can enter about the image , such as who is on the image , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the Info@@ box on the upper part of the image that you want to see , so you can use it easily with the mouse . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information can be displayed on the viewer . all these options are shown below you can see below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would have chosen people out of the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have uploaded several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the buttons picture high and end . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run these as Di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; photo album ; invites you a new picture after a few seconds . how often a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus . &quot;
a very useful capability of the viewer &apos;s size &amp; photo album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the entry button to change in full screen mode and back .
&quot; if you use the viewer in the image and zoom out in the image . you can easily get a rectangle with the mouse button . with the Min@@ us key , you can zoom out the plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the Zo@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not drawn . with the circuit button , the zo@@ oms puts it on the screen of a pixel screen . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work with videos that are in and out @-@ out with the Plus@@ - and minus .
&quot; using the context menu from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes on the current picture with the menu option notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the pictures , you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to cancel the picture . at the moment you can view the view and configuration dialog of the image to mark this name . but you will perhaps prefer to mark the picture and consider more images . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want to start viewing the viewer and mark it as good or bad , while you can watch one after the others . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with features while you see them . features are the letters A to Z and you can put the letters A to Z and you can see the corresponding letters . in the case you see a picture where the features are A , B and C. &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your pictures , they are available in your browser . so you can see all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , so you can use a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be shown in the front view . if you can view categories in D@@ re Pre@@ views , then you can simply add the letters to the picture by simply copy the letters to the feature , after the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint your photo album ; painting on the picture .
&quot; the painting is not stored in the image , but in the database . on the way you can make your common back@@ drop later . &quot;
you can see a picture on the painted picture . to switch the painting of &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; to switch the painting from the context menu . to end the painting you simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar above at the top of the window .
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers , you must not have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully equipped , but documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should have absolutely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object @-@ tree , you can select single objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the sub@@ object of a selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object @-@ tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select one menu entry in the menu insert . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following entry menu will be built , so you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with the delete , either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , please click on application to adopt these changes . if you have invali@@ d values , you can report a message with error message . then you can click the input command and dis@@ card changes to break down . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download them here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
&quot; if you edit a texture , or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the Own View . &quot;
&quot; when you select a preview in the self @-@ economic view and a small example of the scene is marked with the chosen texture . if you want to select a lower element , even if you want to select a lower element ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross locally . &quot;
screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can pull these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation , as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag with the mouse over the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a viewing level . you can specify that value relative to the visual object , or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility under the visible level of the scene . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; has a window order than default . the object @-@ tree and view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window order , or if you need another arrangement , you can store them at any time . you can also convert multiple window orders and switch between different directions . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window over or below a view , drag the shape to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rectangle is then showing the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the summary to the right or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to arrange several views over each other , drag the façade in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views on the map @-@ card in the top to the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window order are floating views : views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . in order to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the shape to the desktop or click on the small left at the top of the arrow . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the An@@ clu@@ stering bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add additional views to the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are web@@ cam , you can anchor it at any point . &quot;
&quot; the current window view can store you with view window order ... save . it will display a dialog , where you can store the window order under a existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program was done correctly . as this manual is written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the symbol Ren@@ dering the symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool bar or select the menu option on the scene . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s In@@ i files . it determines the image size and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview up to Full Version of highest quality . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the icon The R@@ ender in the tool bar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu , select the following dialog : &quot;
&quot; every R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that can recognize the attributes of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to ren@@ dering only a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the picture section for ren@@ dering into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination quality you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user Reflex@@ ions lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; if a picture is drawn with only one beam per pixel , various errors can be created . these pictures often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are displayed smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technology called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this mistakes . generally pictures with this feature looks better .
&quot; if you activate anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam each pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . the second method is adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is adapted again and adap@@ tive because each pixel output depends on the calculated colour values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values are processed , both pixels will be calculated using a limited additional number of pixels with a value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional R@@ ays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b . 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the colour values exceeds the given threshold , the pixel in 4 sub@@ pixel is divided , and the maximum depth of rec@@ ur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the Stra@@ hl process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . when you turn J@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the R@@ ays to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light refle@@ x@@ ion . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature . &quot;
&quot; on this card card , you can adjust if the alpha @-@ channels are supposed to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . one pixel is then transparent if the associated rays are not taken . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console input . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly ended , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select the menu entry file imports ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; not yet the full command of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window shows a list of messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object @-@ tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import objects in the written text file in the editor . to import objects in the scene , select the source code in the editor and drag it into the lenses . &quot;
&quot; with copying and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling , and in your editor you can insert the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers . usually this P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray is usually called .
&quot; if you click on Help in the self @-@ economic view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document re@@ tention and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searching for external files ( for example , al@@ tim@@ bers ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you are files in the scene , you &apos;ll also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the colour for wireless models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the colour for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the colour of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type characteristic .
&quot; you can adjust the objects on the button on the grid in the context menu of the wire @-@ button . you can adjust the button separately for shifts , sc@@ ur@@ ations and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values are a more accurate wire model and thus a better approach to the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the sphere you can set the details level for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projec@@ tions , all wire model views are further divided when the camera provides a extended projection screen . extended projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with exceptions of perspective and vertical projec@@ tions . this feature gives a better approach to projec@@ tions , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; when you cross a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you cross ground , a floor below the objects is rounded . the floor is presented in a box pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the edge of cant@@ or , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for ren@@ dering scenes can be set . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more information regarding parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing windows arrangements or create new window orders . in the section of window orders , you can create and store window orders . &quot;
the combination field standard window order : displays all existing windows arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; used the selected window order starting at the start of the program .
the list of fore@@ seen window orders shows all existing windows assign@@ ments . a new arrangement allows you to create and delete a selected layout with the button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the chosen window order . new views can you create and remove selected views with the button .
&quot; the new window position . with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with im@@ prints you will receive a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and web@@ bing the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you &apos;ve just installed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start any more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you want to create all steps in this guide , you should make the ultimate but simple scene , with beginners very popular : a ball on a plane . &quot;
&quot; however , you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings before you compl@@ ain that you can only get a black screen as a result . if you are using a 3D program for the first time , you should consider this important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not adjust camera , no rules for ren@@ dering can be applied as a result , you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t insert a light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will only receive a black painting . &quot;
&quot; when you have installed everything , you &apos;ll see the following start of up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; the following vo@@ w window order : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . please read the documentation , so you can get an appropriate performance of what you can expect from this programme . &quot;
&quot; you will often use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starting with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object @-@ tree . select the scene and then choose the menu entry . thus , you have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene , which you create . in particular , you notice the scene from the point of view of the camera . this is the view of the scene from the scene . this shows you the result of the racing scene . &quot;
&quot; the object @-@ tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the content of view object properties , where the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; please find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change anything about the fundamental settings of the camera , this is later used instructions , but note that the camera will change the camera in view of the camera . just click on the left mouse button to a control point and drag it to the desired position . &quot;
&quot; if you push the button to the button or input , the wire model views and the lenses can immediately change these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you might add a Qu@@ ader ( insert end@@ able body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that &apos;s a reverse method for the solution of this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
&quot; a good advice : choose the level in the object @-@ tree , change the name and press the button user or input devices . in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view also shows the level , although at the moment only a limited level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane expands up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you see the object @-@ tree exactly , you &apos;ll notice that you can click the entry for the bottom . in this case , you will find only the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move to the floor to exercise a unit under the Horizont@@ al line , only to get some of these parameters . select &quot; Dis@@ placement and ask the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first choose the floor to insert the material characteristics . there are many different materials , but select something unique in the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialogue in which you can select how the object should be inserted . pig@@ ment is then displayed in the object tree ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with one click on the button preview , look like the pig@@ ment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments also shows a m@@ ite black material because you can still need to check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , you can now find the colors for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities but now take the easiest way . &quot;
&quot; if you see no colour on qu@@ ader and ball in the preview , click on the button user and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is set right now . if you ren@@ dering your image with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course you are not the color . you are here further settings . in the color list you need to set two new attributes . in the color list , select this entry twice ( you can do this also more frequently , but the chess board color list may only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object @-@ tree every time , select the colors in view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; you should already be able to perform this step , as you should have the basic labour mode of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; you can already understand the ball just like the floor : &quot;
&quot; in view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . put the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or button user ) , so the ball would swe@@ pt over the floor , as you have shi@@ fted the ground around a unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , ren@@ dering is now a strange result : how to see before , the ball is like a sheet of black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can point to the material now . as in the bottom , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; choose the most sub@@ object and change the name for example in the Pig@@ ment . Click on the Pig@@ ment , then choose the colour and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; however , you can reach interesting effects if you take time to set some finish features : &quot;
&quot; then , change the values like in the following screen photos and click on application or press the input button . &quot;
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces , even if metal : not yet been selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of it , which possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; it offers you already much lear@@ nt that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ tra@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you have a scene of ra@@ y@@ tra@@ cts , ren@@ dering a hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflect the scenes ) through any pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects may seem to effect , like the atmospheric effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects will be processed . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see no camera without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you can see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , any scene needs to be cut , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously prepared with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; whenever you can open a new model , you will insert the file into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest record in the list . &quot;
&quot; already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you &apos;ll need to enter a name and storage space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last stored version . all changes have been dis@@ car@@ ded since last time .
you can only select this menu option if you haven &apos;t saved any changes in the scene .
&quot; repe@@ ats the last modified command . this menu entry can only be select , if you are used to work properly . &quot;
&quot; stores the current window order and opens up a dialog , which you can enter a name for a new arrangement , or write an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; here you can change the appearance , the keys and the default behavior . &quot;
opens up a dialog for changing the keyboard button . you can change this option pre@@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; change commands or new ones .
opens up a dialog to set up the tool@@ box . you can add this option tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; add commands and remove .
&quot; a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a possibility to create rough surfaces , without creating every be@@ eu@@ le on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models will then be processed to give them a more realistic appearance . &quot;
&quot; a texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , using a picture file as a color tab . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
pictures can either be displayed in your own window in size of the image or image screen .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or button Return .
&quot; you can set , whether each image will be displayed in a separate window , or if all pictures are always using the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field has been found in the right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file is highlighted by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; set up in the dialog - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of these , General and processing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the working mode of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ ness . in the two others , short commands for the display window and short commands can be specified for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; this is selected , then the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with background colour , which can be adjusted below . pre@@ set is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , downloads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ ness ; already the next picture in the folder , while you are still looking for the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for slide show . &quot;
this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; at the end of the last opened Order &apos;s folder . next start &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; Click on the colored beams to select a background colour . this is used in order to fill the background screen in full screen mode . if in window mode , the window is larger than the image , also the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can set &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; set up , that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also show the program . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window displays the display window to the full screen . this option is switched on as default . &quot;
determines whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the time span between the image change in a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is interrupted by the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . &quot;
&quot; here , change the key collection for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for your browser . &quot;
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays great symbols for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short display .
shows small symbols for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short display .
shows performance images for files in folder . this ad is only possible in the short display .
the image decreased by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlarged the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; it is also closed when no browser window is open .
display the picture in original size . this is only useful if the automatic scale sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame , which you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show photo ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; photo processing based on the &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; image processing . &amp; show photo ; is part of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; project .
&amp; show photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; K@@ DE ; it &apos;s &amp; show photo ; an open source project . this means that users can contribute to its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&amp; show photo ; makes it as easy as possible to report any mistakes or possible improvements . if you use this menu an entry reports you problems or wishes . this shows a link to the reports of problems and wishes . all required information is filled out and you can simply follow the instructions to pass your message .
&amp; show photo ; is a project supported by a community . that is that user and developers can help each other . if you have a more common user from &amp; show photo ; we would like to encourage you to other users of &amp; show photo ; however , we would have questions to other users of other users . in this mailing list will be English so powerful . &quot;
the best start to participate in &amp; show photo ; to participate it is the developer mailing list . instruction to join the developer mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; show photo .
&amp; show photo ; try to give you much control over his work processes as possible . there are many options that change the behaviour of &amp; show photo . to access these settings you need to set up in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left .
&quot; in the exposure of exposure indicators you can select the color , which is displayed if the under@@ - or over@@ load @-@ dict@@ ator should be selected . in contrast , the colors should display with what you are supposed to display in contrast . sub@@ strate should display a dark colour and over@@ exposed a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show photo ; owns a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and promotions to the selected pictures . you can also view this page in which you click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&amp; an@@ ite l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning the scan of images that doesn &apos;t make more than pictures to scan and en@@ rich .
&quot; &amp; n@@ ite l@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan and en@@ rich in a specified file , or save the pictures immediately in a specified file , or save the pictures immediately in a specified file with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the pictures from the store . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner on the s@@ ane project page by clicking the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ t@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .p@@ l .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; an@@ ite ; with the command @-@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog will be opened to choose the scanner . &quot;
the user can choose to use scanner and press OK to open the scanner . stop and end up .
the further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
&quot; in order to insert a picture , the user can start a pre@@ amp and then choose scanning for the final scan . the pre @-@ scan can start through the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in that window . &quot;
&quot; when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Save a preview in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a fore@@ front window as shown below , then the image will be stored and lie ? it leads to a demol@@ ition and you enter into the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the button settings , the same name is opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; users can look at the image if desired , in front of the Save . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the species such as &amp; j@@ l@@ ite ; images to select the dialog for each image , open the dialog before each one @-@ called image . if &amp; n@@ ite , this automatically has to store with a generated name in a pre @-@ defined file , then you have to store without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the pictures are stored in the option without asking for a file name . if the pictures are stored for each scan , then this folder will be used as standard for dialogue . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a image pre@@ fix for automatically save images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . it is automatically counted , if a picture is saved , the string # # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; users can adjust the image quality to save image quality . this value changes the compression value while saving . if you don &apos;t select the image quality , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button help will start the K@@ DE help with the &amp; Can@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button above will start the K@@ DE about -@@ dialog for &amp; Can@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; j@@ l@@ ite ; to finish .
&quot; the GP@@ L is licensed under the GP@@ L and used the lib@@ ks@@ ane library , which is used by &amp; c@@ ite , under L@@ GP@@ L . attention : li@@ bs@@ ane is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception . &quot;
&quot; &amp; amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs key pendant . below , you will set a list of this abbrevi@@ ation and its function . select a list of this key pendant in the player window and select the global key pendant by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select short command ... select . &quot;
you may be able to set existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; amar@@ ok ; short commands work . thereby you make your keyboard to the &amp; amar@@ ok ; control centre .
&quot; the D@@ COP @-@ interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , play@@ list , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists ; such as : &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and K@@ DE ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ sharing options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so the user may not run . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE binding for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
&quot; in file scripts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can quickly find them as base for your own scripts or simply determine the necessary functions . they will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; using D@@ COP , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; that should lie to each K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most script languages enable the execute of external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called ex@@ ec &gt; relatively simple . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; amar@@ ok ; send noti@@ fications to all current scripts . for this reason , scripts are to monitor their default settings and respond to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use of it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to preview the box dialog . in order to store the store and loading data each script needs to take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok uses the folder to the folder , where all data should be stored . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ ck@@ change indicates that a new piece is used . the script might now query &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP @-@ functions , further information about the new piece should query ( for example , the met@@ ad@@ ata or the play length ) . &quot;
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ men@@ u@@ cked : sub@@ ordin@@ it@@ em@@ Title &#93; Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the play@@ list if a user @-@ defined menu entry can also be used to remove d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script pet@@ ri@@ pp@@ .@@ Soft Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
&quot; before &amp; amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ated , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to work for example , for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ oks script administration may also install script packages , which can be compressed to users &amp; b ; such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the users can recognize the archive clearly as the Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 only script packages can be used with the Extended amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages like right .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ sar parameter -@@ p around the file &apos;s rights : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and depend on the wi@@ ki scripts side by &amp; amar@@ ok ; you should use the Cat@@ amar@@ ok category for your entry to K@@ DE apps . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; . &amp; amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprising to use .
&quot; with &amp; amar@@ ok , you can simply drag the music to the play@@ list instead of going through endless menus . maybe you can also find only a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collecting brows@@ ers and quick search will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right one for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and intelligent play@@ lists the correct music after certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . you can also use many different audio systems such as they want to listen to your music . this and even many other useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , you must type the Fol@@ ok source file in the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok , and install : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no difficulty while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report these in the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; has some options like most applications you can activate or dis@@ able to comp@@ ile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met , so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system requirements . &quot;
activ@@ ating deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help at the development of &amp; amar@@ ok ; you should use full use . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; set up without effort to set up the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; players window displays the player window in addition to play@@ list . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists windows are displayed ( Ju@@ K ) . &quot;
voting barometer : this feature is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar has been compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; shape design : this feature is only available , if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar has been compiled . therefore , the used color scheme for the voting rights is changed . &quot;
tuning files at the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored on the storage location of the respective music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored on the location folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / m@@ ood@@ bar / m@@ ood@@ bar / m@@ ood@@ le / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browser : allows you to choose which browser of &amp; amar@@ ok , should be started when a browser is required . &quot;
&quot; other brows@@ ers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list . &quot;
&quot; play@@ list when storing , save the current play@@ list automatically at the end of &amp; amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list when you don &apos;t want to lose . &quot;
&quot; relative paths to manually saved play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , use &amp; amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the storage location of play@@ list . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; current piece of piece change visu@@ alized , that the play@@ lists windows are up / off , to keep the current piece in the visible window frame . &quot;
&quot; when shifting to the context of the context @-@ browser , it automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is used . &quot;
in the section visual appearance you can adapt &amp; amar@@ ok to custom@@ ize the appearance . the section is in three parts sub @-@ section .
&quot; in the fon@@ ts section , you can adjust the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; amar@@ ok , otherwise you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context @-@ browser . press on out ... , so you can select a font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of custom sha@@ des , you have set the qu@@ al of choice and set a separate color scheme . for this purpose , use the color chosen for front and background colour . &quot;
&quot; when starting with the start , Play &amp; amar@@ ok ; after the program starts playback the reproduction automatically with the piece on the spot , with which they stopped at the final finish . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to setup your O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can look at the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
&quot; the first option is the font . to select from the dialog , select the desired font type for the O@@ SD . the check box is sha@@ ved , the text in the O@@ SD is displayed . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;ll use the option to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color faces opens the dialog for color selection . if own colors are not activated , the pre @-@ set &amp; K@@ DE are used . &quot;
&quot; the input text text is displayed in the O@@ SD text . by the input of plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholder and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the screen is designed for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can set up on what screen of a multi @-@ monitor screen environment will appear the O@@ SD . &quot;
&quot; the audio output audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the selection box , enabling some drivers to activate further adjustment possibilities in this card card . &quot;
&quot; the card collection is used for setting all settings for your collection , which includes the folder and the type of database for the collection . &quot;
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; amar@@ ok ; according to music files . to include a folder into the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes to insert , as with selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes that &amp; amar@@ ok ; both crossed and their sub@@ folder as well as their sub@@ folder as well .
monitor changes : enables &amp; amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected file on changes ( e.g. music files added or deleted ) . additionally an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
play@@ lists import@@ antly : causes &amp; amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists added to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . then the play@@ lists are then published later in play@@ lists browser .
&quot; the part collection database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the combination field driver : allows you to choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , further setup is necessary in the sub @-@ window MySQL . &quot;
the MySQL device is used for setting the database for &amp; amar@@ ok ; used by calcul@@ ator : will the computer be entered in which the MySQL database is entered in which the database is accessible via the database . name : is the database name to which the connection is made .
use us@@ ername : and password : to enter the data required for the connection to the database .
&quot; the Kart@@ u@@ per@@ .@@ f@@ m card supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; amar@@ ok , can transmit the names of played on a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and need to create music @-@ recommendations regarding the current piece . &quot;
&quot; here you enter your us@@ ername and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send pieces and update the profile : this setting enables it &amp; amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters : after activation of this setting is called &amp; amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters must be played on each piece . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and gallery with screen photos .
am@@ aro@@ K only requires the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs contained in it ) because &amp; amar@@ ok ; requires some of these tools such as modules or scripts . we have written a small guide how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD predic@@ ts that your window manager will function the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . so , Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably one of your files will create a bug in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . you can also send the file to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , and you also depend on this error to the crash of the crash . after that , you can delete the file and release the collection again . &quot;
&quot; mostly , this is that Tag@@ li@@ b read in reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file system crashing . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try again SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; amar@@ ok ; is a bit sophisticated . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example &amp; amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b is compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to the met@@ eor shower information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE using art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate machine . turn off if in@@ active for ... into the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send the back@@ trace to us by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically returns to a crash ) . if it is a common cause , and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is the fact that many program write data as UTF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info@@ s , but these are not known as Unicode label . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; The File $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : Mp@@ li@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repet@@ ition / dynam@@ ical play@@ list ) can be found in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the tool@@ effects can be found in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can click the tool@@ effects on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases up to three times you need to click on a symbol until this attitude will show their effect .
if you receive this error : amar@@ oc@@ app : icon look@@ up error : un@@ il@@ oc@@ app : un@@ fore@@ icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixel map then please check if am@@ aro@@ K is used the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which cat@@ amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may be able to remove any col@@ li@@ dic@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to find the correct version first . &quot;
there are some options . most Install@@ ations problems clarify yourself at the ligh@@ test by using your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please only wear a mistake when you find something at the correction of an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; amar@@ ok ; only an empty play@@ list . how do music pieces come in ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired file . then drag the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
&quot; to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start @-@ up window is converted into the statistics window . you will find it under ex@@ tras statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are calculated for the rating by users while the points are calculated automatically .
&quot; to evaluate the pieces , the rating list must be displayed in the play@@ list . Click on the track list . Click anywhere in the new evaluation column to determine the evaluation of Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from play@@ list from the folding menu . &quot;
&quot; create a play@@ lists file with the mouse into the play@@ list , and let them fall there , just as you would do it with other files . so simply : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , directly next to the add @-@ button , you &apos;ll save the play@@ list . Click on it . &quot;
&quot; presumably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel package and install the package X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel and re@@ install &amp; amar@@ ok , this package also contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be reached in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you will find it on the menu bar under ex@@ tras equ@@ ali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; no . yes , that really is really ! no ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question : what media types does support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can also support text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; it may be ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where@@ with the default no MP3 decoder are supplied ( for pat@@ ent@@ less reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , &quot;
&quot; start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well , so ... &amp; amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - ) &quot;
&quot; if you use the G@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a mixer . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device for the same time and simultaneously . this can be achieved through a sound card using hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem of problem and a solution . for G@@ amb@@ amer , you possibly need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; that does and amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media must be de@@ coded first . you can only use a white noise . G@@ amb@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data first . G@@ amb@@ amer can spend directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of the Arts . open Sound@@ server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ or@@ ity ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ ou@@ ra@@ pper is set : &quot;
&quot; at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs that can cause sound reproduction . read this error report . read the sound of sound in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; presumably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change the driver driver , crash@@ es &amp; amar@@ ok . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all components . execute G@@ ST register , to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ amb@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ dispute .
&quot; try this ( stop am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Download ff peg , compiled and install it . then , you will find G@@ ST file extensions once more than your normal user . then delete the module file with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ dispute @-@ config file , and run G@@ ST register . now , start &amp; amar@@ ok . &quot;
please report it on bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of proposals / desires to send them best to our mailing list : amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . also the name contains the magic K ... : )
&quot; thanks D@@ COP , this is already possible . set in your calendar program an alarm and run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok player play &quot;
this command leaves &amp; amar@@ ok ; playback will start . make sure that &amp; amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed then you will have stopped by the gentle tones of music that you have stopped in front of the bed .
how to know the current in &amp; amar@@ ok ; ongoing titles if one is on another computer ?
&quot; if a functional SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . This command gives you interpre@@ t and titles of the current play : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ us@@ ername amar@@ ok player @-@ Pl@@ aying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your us@@ ername with your us@@ ername . this requires that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA file .
&quot; visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; amar@@ ok ; press windows separately . press on the keyboard and current analy@@ zer , in an independent , in size variable window . &quot;
&quot; the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + rights Mau@@ st@@ aste puts a piece in the qu@@ eue in the qu@@ eue . by pressing the input button , the first search result is played and the search is reset . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and play@@ list have tri@@ ck@@ eted functions , but how does it look with the symbol in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; my personal file $ HO@@ ME is based on an NFS drive . after the start of am@@ aro@@ K , the collection database can not be created and there are many errors on the console . what now ? &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database by &amp; amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / cat@@ o on a local drive or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
&quot; place the CD , then click on Audio CD . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders . to normal reading , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired target folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . instead , you take files from the folder mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;

&quot; basically this makes the previous evaluation with a decrease value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has each individual assessment on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can insert the rating for a piece by clicking on a column title in the play@@ lists window . then you can mark the review of a piece in the play@@ lists , namely by using the right mouse button on the piece and edit : evaluation or F2 . you can also edit the review in the dialog Metad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the developers don &apos;t want to present you , when you want to publish a stable version of am@@ aro@@ K . this means : K@@ DE packages do not have a fixed release plan of the set @-@ up plan of am@@ aro@@ K . &quot;
this is a new function in am@@ aro@@ K that some users can certainly find ner@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the option icon while playing in general settings .

&quot; download a design , or create an own . install this then under am@@ aro@@ K ... appearance of context @-@ browser design , click on new design .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was to be similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ quest@@ .com ) , to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
&quot; quer@@ or navigation system allows you to monitor monitoring and control of &amp; amar@@ ok , while you can click Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to display the navigation range . then click on the button settings ( the top ) and select in the folding menu add amar@@ ok . &quot;
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to the information that will be sent on an independent server . service is free and you need only one free user name and password . audio cro@@ ll@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please select the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of separation and causing a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably has been &amp; amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have compiled x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . so the . / configure routine does not comp@@ ile this output modules . you need to configure and install .
now I have &amp; amar@@ ok ; new installed but the output modules are still not yet . and now ?
&quot; presumably , use a distribution that is installing the development files separated from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is missing , the necessary development files are missing . the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards you have to re@@ comp@@ ile and install it again . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer Crit@@ ical * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?

&quot; the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current play . its look can be adapted to the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ t . these three sub @-@ windows are still shi@@ fted into detail . they provide information about running various aspects . &quot;

&quot; if you want to look for a piece that doesn &apos;t contain a specific search term , make a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something searches after pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;

&quot; opens up the dialog for form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialogue you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format , making the contents completely er@@ ased . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing mod@@ i over@@ write and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog is burning a pre @-@ setting CD image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ rescue or * .@@ to@@ c file , which then immediately is not supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , for example , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; bur@@ ns an earlier DVD copy . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source , which then can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; an earlier DVD video can be converted . thus , this dialogue window will be used . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used below . it contains information about the selected video , code settings and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the pic@@ kled medium . these information are presented in the content view and include properties of the media , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of the tool holders of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a little glue at the lower edge of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view turns off or out . the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with functions such as media information , blocking , and unlock the drive or dis@@ card of the media . &quot;
&quot; the content view turns on or from . the content view allows you to select and drag files to the project view . the content view is also selected to read audio or video CDs , if a drive selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head di@@ lig@@ ently turns into the project view or from . the copy is a nar@@ ro@@ wer area that is only visible when the project view has open projects . the head@@ board has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialogue window to modify the key orders for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the button arrangement . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; alignment assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs are required . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you need to enter the password manager for the system administrator ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is designed for person@@ alise and designed to the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications also equipped with an &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can either use the command program d@@ co@@ p , or something more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are crucial in the functionality , so it is rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial to give the accompanying programs . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command program d@@ co@@ p . to ensure the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions must be used to ensure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then , enter something like the following : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , all &amp; K@@ DE ; program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mostly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the Standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; combines functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD , and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ denti@@ fied CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ denti@@ fied CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ denti@@ fied CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ denti@@ da CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) &quot; &quot; D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) &quot; &quot; D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) &quot; &quot; D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) &quot; &quot; D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) &quot; &quot; D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) &quot; &quot; D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) &quot; &quot; D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) &quot; &quot; D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) &quot; &quot; D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) &quot; &quot; D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) &quot; &quot; D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) &quot; &quot; D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) &quot; &quot; D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) &quot; &quot; D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) &quot; &quot; D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ C@@ dr@@ w &quot; &quot; ( ) &quot; &quot; D@@ COP@@ Ref . &quot; &quot; ( ) &quot;
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ am@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method one can create a D@@ COP reference to the newly generated project : D@@ COP@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively one project can be obtained via the command line : # 3@@ b @-@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface Add Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b provides the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the high @-@ performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface that is applicable to data on data ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; cre@@ am@@ ate@@ urs ( Q@@ string name ) , cre@@ denti@@ als ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string ) p@@ add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ string ) , p@@ add@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ Name ) , set@@ list ID ( Q@@ string id ) &quot;
&quot; thus it is possible to fill out a script with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT 12 PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ denti@@ sts of d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ denti@@ sts of d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ denti@@ sts $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ denti@@ sts / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ denti@@ als / fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; audi@@ ovis@@ ual Creator ; is an audio CD ; choose audio CD ; it can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and many co@@ di@@ ers , which are currently installed as default for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and F@@ LA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) . more co@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) will be compressed to the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or even in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less F@@ LA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , read the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , this must now be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ until ( for OGG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers are already present , but it &apos;s probably not necessary to comp@@ ile something itself . however , if F@@ LA@@ C does not need to be used , the installation is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; what code file / file format should be used ? a small introduction about co@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compres@@ sing factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is not possible to avoid any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device is not possible to avoid any copy protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy protection audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while keeping the setup only once ( the setup dialog can be found so often called up to a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling of the user interface is explained ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ bled at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert in many formats - depending on which co@@ di@@ ers are installed ( MP3 , OGG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can get &amp; CD ; get information from Free@@ DB from the internet , or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is only a short list of commands of the main window . on the page , for example , more information is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab cards for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB will start on request from the CD data according to the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case must first be connected to the Internet . ) &quot;
start reading and - if a Encoder is configured in the setup manual code settings - the coding .
&quot; opens up a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that the selection with another Encoder can be read as the standard . it is noted that previously the Encoder is configured in the setup dialog box settings . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that a already selected file will be selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; to read and en@@ code . &quot;
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages ( such as protocols , p@@ ie@@ p@@ sen ) for programming events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) . &quot;
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with various card cards ( such as Encoder , to set up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you need to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ di@@ ers and compression rates and helps you choose the right code . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information should be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides F@@ LA@@ C there are also others like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats which lose information by data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG today may have an easy advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above these bit@@ rate the differences are less important because both co@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , &apos; lame &apos; will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high up to very high sound quality ( at high rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
OGG - if only music should be heard from one machine or a machine @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG cutting devices are present .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices like standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special Auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 , these tools only support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list with parameters for audio quality and from the combination rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This attitude gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set Standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer to most people and most of the acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi @-@ stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi @-@ stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always need 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of titles . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi @-@ stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . well gen@@ ug for music of juven@@ iles , portable devices and auto@@ ster@@ e@@ o@@ int@@ ments . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you necessarily want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information that can be entered manually or by the program automatically generated from Free@@ DB via the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be delivered / used with &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the code name as well as the attributes of music files .
&quot; in connection with code programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the co@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; add to the keyword ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are encoded with lame , the switch -@@ tt from lame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ deficiency ; parameters that can be used ( = button in the assistant ) :
&quot; this is what the Free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can read / enter the information up / enter , so that all the other can download this information instead of the computer : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of the pieces &amp; etc . , not by the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( announ@@ cing the author ) I &apos;m not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent the information without the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so can neither the artist nor the music company harm . if any information can be done by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is active in a check box ( sending an address ) when used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used when calling out the server ( This may only know the programmer to know the code . ) &quot;
&quot; in many countries , there are copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; used to use Free@@ DB , the ge@@ ographic will be used on the next mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and resem@@ bles the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org supplies a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database . &quot;
which excer@@ pts program will be used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there is rum@@ ours that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia will be used to know , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to save the selected WAV files , the co@@ di@@ ers and the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compres@@ sing for audio data ) can be added to the registry . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added to this tab . &quot;
&quot; the code package must be installed from the Linux distribution , before the co@@ di@@ ers can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . more information about co@@ di@@ ers are in the chapter Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; after installing a co@@ di@@ ers , further information can be obtained via the input of a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . it has to be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read whether cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio co@@ di@@ ers of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal . that might be something wrong . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step for example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ for @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and start our first &amp; CD ; we will use &apos; lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; it must have cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame have already installed on your computer . both programs should be considered pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for lame can be found as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , what you can always do . &quot;
please ensure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd is that you own write permission ( eg ; by copying the Con@@ quer@@ or something into ) .
&quot; the first section deals with the basic set of &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , something which is thought to be done only once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the reading for reading a &amp; CD ; , which must be repeated for each read &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; here we determine the use of co@@ di@@ ers for compression of music ( &apos; lame ) and audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with running Free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet download . &quot;
&quot; even though we can change this settings at any time , we will probably do not change them at any pron@@ unci@@ ation of a &amp; CD ; change when once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is given to the evaluation program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be found .
&quot; frequently is / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not works or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is also available , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device design@@ ations for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the Map tab General settings . here you can &apos;t do much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is shown as in screen photo . &quot;
&quot; only for complete information , please select so that you will be informed when you are using keyword ( tags ) . &quot;
the card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the internet from a Free@@ DB computer .
note : calcul@@ ator must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; with the Internet he can access the Free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , will be a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , if you are un@@ happy with the database entry and the directory entry , they can easily be changed with the database entry and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; aside from this example , further notice : if you want to enter everything manually , you can select the selection fields and Free@@ DB file if you need to download the database before . however , you can be selected using Free@@ DB in off @-@ line mode , at least the first select areas must be selected , at least the first mode is set up on the following card card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is free for us Free@@ DB . these are settings for the data on request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB server to the internet . how do the system that data will get the CD ? read the section on Free@@ DB . read the section above Free@@ DB . read the section above Free@@ DB . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we want to work only with the remote database on the Internet Server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and watch them after a mirror server nearby . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will function as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function does not work equal to the server , as many fire@@ walls used the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf in the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit it &amp; CD ; data to the Free@@ DB server . the first check box should be dis@@ able . &quot;
simply take the settings from screen photo . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of un@@ appro@@ ach@@ able pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it just try . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece : pass this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process , check it out . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined file for temporary files : if you cross this folder , then the path / folders will be specified in which the WAV files will be stored . if you don &apos;t want to install the files in the private file . don &apos;t forget to do this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; everything is done as it is on screen photo . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances , something has to be flo@@ cked to the right , to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned before , it is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi @-@ stereo systems . the resulting output factor is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &quot; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &quot; tags can be deleted . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of input file ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of encoded WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , it can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; termin@@ ate . this configuration is used as default for each pron@@ unci@@ ation of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen organizational structure of your music , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; this section is described , as the process of exec@@ uting the &amp; CD ; it is described in the previous section and set up a connection to the internet , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from Free@@ DB can pick up in this section , it has to be repeated for each license and CD ; it is necessary to be repeated . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD , which is still not included in Free@@ DB , the screen photos will see a little differently than that for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; instead , you will learn the &amp; CD ; instead of taking data on the differences . comments are shown on the differences . &quot;
try not the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author &apos;s manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD now has to be specified in the drive , which is defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and its length should be listed in the window as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , then look for questions and answers to the help or go back to the previous section concerning the fundamental settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD has been picked up successfully from Free@@ DB , all tracks are filled in and they are also displayed by the artist and the album . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window is built , and you can select the database entry that your opinion is best to your &amp; CD ; fits perfectly . &quot;
&quot; if you do not select the check box for the automatic query of Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually reset the selection of the first button in the tool@@ bar , but the data from the internet you need the connection to the internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo , the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Update &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist does not need to be entered in the input field &apos; Update title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower commentary box can be used for the single comments in@@ corporate , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from Free@@ DB is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you do not only begin with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all words with capital letters are beginning or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ ired remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters in the commentary range . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on the tab card code settings ; take a look at the section &apos; Basic settings &apos; . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later , anytime with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers and file formats . see the help of the co@@ di@@ ers to obtain more information .
&quot; simply select one entry , which is obvious to the style of the chosen CD ; this example is not important because we will not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information , please refer to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read more about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example can be found under rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD Edit@@ ors will be back and you will see that the fields for the album are already written with the set @-@ in data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the present piece . specify the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish . &quot;
Click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you have downloaded the data from Free@@ DB . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . be aware that the artist and album will be displayed on the play list .
&quot; note that it has a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected as selected . simply select the selection of the piece , or select the button on the bottom of the screen , select all the pieces on the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; when clicking on the button choose from the reading process , this window appears to confirm . on OK , then we will throw a look at the window with the entries and follow what runs out . &quot;
&quot; Click on the rider orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right beneath the buttons of the tool bar . &quot;
&quot; this is the window for control of orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed on the left bottom of the window in the status bar . &quot;
this error message you will see if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ ers you haven &apos;t installed . pieces which have not been successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target file are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for temporary files and target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
&quot; order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . therefore , reading and coding parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and co@@ sting . at most powerful machines the result is un@@ clear . the use of a am@@ d@@ 64 appears to have no problem with simultaneous reading and co@@ sting ( of course two different pieces ) .
&quot; now the last title is read out while another piece is coded , and a third place is coded in the qu@@ eue of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is coded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window is finished . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x. or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice . &quot;
&quot; as part of the K@@ DE ; CV@@ S are talking about today within the &amp; K@@ DE ; CV@@ S is a pre @-@ compiled package as well . most distri@@ butions are already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; a part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; package is part of your distribution . if you read this , you probably already have done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons , compiled by source files , and not for users intended to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for assistance to how the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations on settings . best read the step for step example to know the options and settings . it displays screen photos of different card cards and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked up after the first start of the program , without any questions about this somehow empty screen ( above all , if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what are the following ? who reads this has probably started the program . it should look somehow like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t commit this manual . it is as the first version for a manual at &amp; audi@@ o@@ Creator ; may it do . at least after the contact with the author , and if you read this section , he has used this section and is therefore agree with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange when you &apos;ve managed to get the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mi@@ de ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ ace of &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition to others , it has not have some properties that have other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it is based on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; K@@ DE ; support function . &amp; k@@ mi@@ ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver , which is supported for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is supported , as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by pressing the pressing keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can go to &amp; K@@ DE ; every MIDI file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window to draw .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( rec@@ lining seats or tex@@ tures ) .
seat support . if you &amp; K@@ DE ; during the play@@ ful of a song you will start with the same song at the next time .
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears to select the usual file dialog , with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also leave a file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows drop . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a music piece , open it and feel the button in the tool bar , select the entry button from the menu piece , or enter the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you go to the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows . ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played each other . )
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; you play a piece , you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator . &quot;
&quot; when you find that a song is too fast or slow down , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the tem@@ po@@ ad , and then click the original speed , double @-@ click on the template . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar or select the menu option pause in the menu , thus interrup@@ ts playback . if no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
lyrics can be stored on two types in a music piece . some pieces apply tex@@ turing , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are supposed to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined to set the song automatically , so you will automatically adjust the kar@@ aoke text automatically . but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other type . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up an event type , select from the menu settings the entries and events . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . these are played the series after ab@@ used . in this section you can use the collections efficiently .
&quot; to lay a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find in the menu Collection under the Point .... Click on New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection is included in the beginning the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the desired parameters in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; to the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . remember that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button . it appears to select the file dialog , with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the attitude of automatic adding to the collection .
&quot; if automatic adding to the collection is enabled , a piece of opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the newly opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on Rem@@ ov@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series after the menu of the menu , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or delete random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager or use the selection list on kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song further , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu or press the button arrow on the right . &quot;
&quot; in order to jump a song back , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu or press the button arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click to delete the button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter because it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events which the syn@@ thesizer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map that conver@@ ts all events of Change patch to B@@ right Piano in the events of Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus making a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ map because all sound cards GM are compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices , and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite dit@@ or ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required conver@@ sions for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which is how many times it may appear as desired . however , that every occurr@@ ence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of the Key@@ map ... &quot; End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further Key@@ map ... &quot; End De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... End options ... End
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is used to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and end , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your Map file as an e @-@ mail , so that I in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the patches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard . the general use is as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equation are ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you can &apos;t change the order thus and do not allow the line for one of 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard has no tissues ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a tissue . in addition , wear the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so now , if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( ri@@ fle shooting ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here is meant by the term drum patch of the patch included , in which each tone is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ er instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one , at which the tone is the pitch of the always same drum ( such as some keyboards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section will be used to specify the sounds on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several keyboards for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to make sounds on the per@@ k@@ ite channel . look as an example the supplied keyboards .
&quot; this section can be used to form some channels on other , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply make it simply in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; this channel is the channel that is displayed on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , you &apos;ll need to use the key@@ map option for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored when using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , will always be ignored the patch on this channel . in this case , patch is always used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to use the per@@ k@@ ite patch on the per@@ k@@ ite channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der &apos;s ratio is multiplied , in which ratio of Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events is multiplied and then for@@ warded to the value n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) , it will be re@@ directed by the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) , so that the value of 40@@ 96 is used in the map file ( no dec@@ imal number ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM provides a keyboard , which is to play an pitch of a pitch of 40@@ 96 , to play a tone higher . unfortunately , some keyboards to play two sounds up to a oct@@ ave . unfortunately , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try to try a bit . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . these can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
&quot; the se@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole range of piano pieces ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pieces , you &apos;ll see which sounds are just played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose a instrument , the button doesn &apos;t lights any more green , but red , to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
&quot; the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the mir@@ ro@@ red tones . view in the menu settings under the point channel view : settings &quot;
&quot; the Tempo LCD displays the speed , which is played with a song . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the temp@@ o of a song . if you can find a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . thus , the same MIDI file may lead to very different results , just like two different musicians the same notes can play in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
that can happen if you have a binary dispute ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; have that happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support you have to download and install a source file ( for example of k@@ mid ; &apos;s homepage ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole file to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all the files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . open the folder you want to add in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; choose all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows . &quot;
&quot; in advance , enable the setting of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can click the arrow key left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the reproduction . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
&quot; I have on a &amp; K@@ DE ; desktop Desktop , &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; if I want to play a aoke file or attached ( if I want to play a aoke file ) or attached ( if I want to play a Karaoke file , or if I want to play a file , merely go to the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or window , and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them immediately to a collection , turn the attitude of automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let us assume that you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. for only you want to play the first file . so , set the setting automatic adding to the collection and open up A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then includes this a MIDI file . &quot;
then join us to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear this song or see the postcard , anim@@ ate me to go further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ zum@@ ah ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not a lot of leisure for my hobbies , but I try to give me a little time . as Hob@@ bies , I try to collect MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; have , or even if you simply want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rac@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make me a huge anticip@@ ation , if you send me a postcard from your home location or a Mi@@ di@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you want to send a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact you with my friends from &amp; k@@ mid ; but you should contact me as I might have the file . &quot;
&quot; I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time , and I &apos;d like to get money back in my spare time . I would therefore want to review that I &apos;m only going to obtain the feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card you &apos;ll have to compiled &amp; k@@ mi@@ ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it works as if you would have a sound card except that you can &apos;t listen to music .

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for player , phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of the M@@ Player or Phon@@ on video files , as well as playback DVD s , VCD s or TV and camera . &quot;

&quot; the application window is formed from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is an information window that will only appear if there is information about it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to en@@ rich the preferred connections under the menu . if you want to create a list of entries , which are played after each other , you should use the category permanent play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ arch@@ ie@@ e . if you select an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups are copied and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; News &apos; , Television and Dur@@ able play@@ list may also be changed through direct editing of XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; k@@ m@@ player / , can only choose from the menu , but also through the application itself . simply clicking on a name of a sub@@ group , just the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , select from the menu , must be selected by play@@ list and select either the edit mode , or select any other category . &quot;
all changes are lost when editing mode or any other group will be selected without the play@@ list .
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ ring and change of &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate any other animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / files / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format needs to be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during the start does not need to be short , it will be termin@@ ated automatically by opening a different source . this would be b@@ other@@ ed at the end @-@ animation however , the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / s ; / are in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL those of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported .
there is a rider for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . this is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this playback device in configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual work of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c file . this is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted into the special field Em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
&quot; thus the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service providers for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash will be specified in the setup dialog file assign@@ ments of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player , is in one consol@@ es application and to browse error messages concerning the store of the browser module library . if there are no errors , the backup output is available within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; so always a pre@@ set back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done through manual change of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ ring . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play either TV cards , either by player or X@@ video ( this needs a k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV , the scanner can be configured from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be ports to be found out of them ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name has probably contained a DVB in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension refers to the X server . for this reason , the video server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; intern@@ ally , the intern@@ ally are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of this documentation , this d@@ v@@ d@@ nav@@ source , d@@ v@@ d@@ source , t@@ v@@ d@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , source source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ ault . if enabled , they start with the play@@ list of play@@ list . &quot;
is there references as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive more qui@@ eter if I play from it ( not of the VCD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to run as users root after inser@@ ting the device . it is absolutely sure to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
X@@ ine starts just slowly but why must my CPU be tested on their performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ h@@ b@@ . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs automatically the last stored value only the first time x@@ ine will test the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphic user interfaces and network support and comp@@ ile to comp@@ ile &amp; c@@ ile ; needed .
&quot; lat@@ ex ; : a professional correspondence application . under Unix @-@ like systems , it is likely to be used on the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) . &quot;
most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution . for the installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow simple installation without further comp@@ ile and are contained on the c@@ ile ; web site .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation is required , however , the support to this project or the documentation , should the contact about the k@@ ile ; website should be made . &quot;
ask questions or to comp@@ ile &amp; c@@ ile ; on or are extensions requested that this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ setting for the use of all lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and easy access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; the possibility to complete , comp@@ ile and easy access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; the possibility to complete , comp@@ ile and easy access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; the easy to operate assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his ways to find out , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with the reading of the Editor &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; Kate . &quot;
for lat@@ ex ; the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TEC@@ H is the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TEC@@ H . it can also use a La@@ ie ( engl@@ ish@@ lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ macro@@ s . a less demanding but realistic extent is that it desc@@ ends from Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
&quot; there is not only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book for this . by &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Us@@ ers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; just like other drawing languages : &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ alized features such as paper format , page print and text characters can be specified as well as a copy of the command \ \ &apos; class , the Cologne command will be closed again with the command \ \ \ &apos; { document } . &quot;
the quick@@ set @-@ up assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is an excellent function for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assistant ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) can also be made to create the document @-@ related settings .
&quot; document classes : hereby &#91; book &#93; , Book &#91; book &#93; , Book &#91; book &#93; , Book &#91; book &#93; , Book &#91; book &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ ink &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Projec@@ tor &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ it &#93; , Fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ it &#93; or Custom &#93; . &quot;
coding : hereby we use the encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use the UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . if necessary , UTF @-@ 8 should be used ( for correct processing of lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) . &quot;
&quot; this list contains the most commonly used packages for lat@@ ex ; for connecting , they only have to be seen in the check box . &quot;
&quot; articles ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( compliance with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find the use of German text messages . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&quot; it offers - as well as other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , att@@ itudes and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; k@@ ile , it is possible to understand that any mathematical environment will not be closed . however , it is due to a modest appearance of output file . however , it will save you through the adv@@ ancement of time and more . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ , { order } ) of &amp; k@@ ile , automatically generates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the da@@ ff@@ icient line to connect the command ( e.g. \ \ \ \ &apos; command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and subtle element ) :
&quot; at the top of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be found very useful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; ger@@ ent file format &#93; was created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document , and other information like the font , and is available in addition to PDF the main output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools available to view , conversion and printing from DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the R@@ Ã ¼ r@@ row search are the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor , and as soon as it is cli@@ cked on a element in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is the exact opposite of it . once on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked on the position in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is used for the respective position in DVI ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
&quot; Master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . using a master document , the work is simplified using other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project management document can be adjusted for project settings . &quot;
fast construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no error in the source code ) .
&quot; file watch : in this mode , the DVI ; file will be on the un@@ parall@@ eled , plus , and there is no call for ey@@ epi@@ ece ; according to the quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the work tool bar , the three large @-@ wide selection fields are required for the rapid integration of the document . the first selection field is designed for rapid integration of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The distribution of lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the radio box Show other is available for inser@@ ting articles , such as tags , sheet music , or references . &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or different element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection of a selection field ) .
&quot; when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is shown . at &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x , this only works when the file is necessary to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; - files can also be written in &amp; c@@ ile ; the author are also written by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e is used for the laying of the fon@@ ts . it can be set the font in the main text , the Fu@@ Ã © sheet , etc . , there are the following characters available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile , there are two select places for setting up : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and celebration of settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason . &quot;
&quot; the cl@@ as@@ ps after the command \ \ , class contain the settings for the command . the font &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays down the font . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this may also happen in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code has to be compiled . the easiest way to this is to use the menu or button . &quot;
the source code must be saved prior to comp@@ ile . &amp; ile ; for storing the storage is automatically applied .
&quot; note the compilation of the document , should be sought after the errors . when using fast construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the log@@ ging should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; a text ( English environment ) is a text which is described differently when the remaining document is created . for example , a report with the font , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s } . &quot;
&quot; there are no restrictions within the environment ( from \ \ ) { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) , there is no restrictions in the environment within a environment . &quot;
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the reading and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , there are certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive , etc . these commands are either by the command \ \ , or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ study { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is long as long as it is closed until it is closed with a \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; a single word in a set can be recur@@ sively displayed by \ \ Emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . quote with \ \ &apos; s { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
&quot; after the background to write the source texts using the &amp; lat@@ ex ; drawing language is shown , now follows a step @-@ for @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; once the wi@@ z@@ ard was entered a bit text , a few adjustments should be accomplished , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . to this , a quote , a few places in the fatty acids and a poem should come to the application to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , via editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( at an internal viewer ) . at an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; it is a large file format ( English . D e V ice I n@@ ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer , such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF - conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file is the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , you can print the document using file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool bar encour@@ ages the conversion of DVI ; -@@ file in other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code was created , the conversion can begin in converting other formats by the button P@@ FE in the tool bar . &quot;
the pre@@ hen@@ ce@@ ful look pl@@ anting the direct leap from the editor to the da@@ wning position inside the DVI ; file .
&quot; ile &amp; ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ der files . to this , only Modern under settings can be set up ... &quot;
&quot; in order to look for the prec@@ urs@@ or search , the mouse poin@@ ter has to be positioned in a row of the source tex@@ tual and connect the socket to the respective position in DVI ; -@@ viewer is then done . &quot;
&quot; using this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; set up and c@@ ile ; set in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( settings oc@@ ular@@ line ... Editor ) &quot;
&quot; if using the quick installation of the &amp; DVI ; viewer cannot be corrected , a bug can be found . if there should be a mistake , this is displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log@@ ist file changes the error source in the source code . in the editor , the button file will always be used for the errors . in order to view the error in the error , the log@@ ist file must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log@@ ging , jumps to the error line . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool bar , a window to choose from the template appears to choose the document . the default files are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting an empty document , a document can be used either by reason on re @-@ written or the assistant to create a new document . further information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; util@@ ising users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates are created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be created or create a new file to create an existing document and a selection of file template . &quot;
&quot; creating a new document from a file to a new document , some characters can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings ... settings General . &quot;
&quot; for creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which character strings from which variables are replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typ@@ ing in document class . typically they will be as follows : \ \ p@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wi@@ z@@ ard and that associated entry to the commands in the editor . once the document has been created , the following steps have been completed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , its own template instead of the standard paper can be changed . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from each &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one in the Internet and searched the steps below . &quot;
&amp; ile ; uses &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and approach of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made out of the menu tools directly .
&quot; to learn more about Kate ; and to learn about Kate &apos;s book , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start playing directly with the reading of the editor of &amp; Kate . &quot;
&quot; ile &amp; ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command line , which can be called for the menu help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a direct description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax . &quot;
a double @-@ click with open tr@@ l button to increase the &amp; tex ; meaning that this means when clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par can be seen .
&quot; when pulling the text with a folded lin@@ ker button , the text is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys , key parts of the source code can be filled in the editing window . &quot;
&quot; ile &amp; ile ; has the possibility to browse the most wide types of source texts , and it can be emphas@@ ized . for example , the lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also mathematical form@@ ul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; a lot of assist@@ ants can be found in the text file . this is a unique way of book@@ marks within the text . this jump stamp is emphas@@ ized , so that at the first input of a character is automatically facil@@ itated . &quot;
&quot; the work is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; Kate ; already excellent ability to use &amp; lat@@ ex ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; specific commands for their selection . under Edit , the following commands are included : &quot;
&quot; there is a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain on both sides an empty line ) . this extended meaning includes tables , lat@@ ex ; commands , and all the other lines of the source code . it is that the fact that the dimensions are separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; there is also the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has a advanced meaning , as this command also uses lat@@ ex ; commands by a trunk ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) command . &quot;
&quot; to view a part of a part of the document , you can get rid of this first . &amp; Kate ; offers the key pendant C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line will be removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the following commands for a faster tool . in order to include the following commands , the following commands are included : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a sales in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of work in paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; for example , it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under Be@@ verage environment for a simple simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; &quot;
&quot; with this command , at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor will be placed directly in front of the command to unlock the environment . &quot;
&quot; with this command , at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ &apos; s { surroundings } , the end of the environment is spec@@ ulated ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many contam@@ inated environmental commands , quickly the panoramic view can be lost quickly . this command must be shut up the last modified environment , so that the poll@@ uted environment structure will not be broken . &quot;
&amp; ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by bra@@ ckets { ... } . under Be@@ ers Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from work environment .
&quot; with this command , at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the welded shut@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; with this command , at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded shut@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; when the cur@@ sor is before or behind the welded cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; group # , will lead to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the typ@@ ing of many scra@@ ped groups bra@@ ckets , the hin@@ d view can be lost quickly . this command must be stopped , so that the welded structure of the &amp; tex ; groups can not be broken . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple instructions for use . for the purpose of purpose , the signs are used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two simple instructions for use will be used . &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two close @-@ to @-@ end signs for lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic set @-@ in for double bond signs can be set under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X and can be used .
&quot; it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. n@@ º or French ) , with German or fran@@ ch@@ oral applications . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
when shifting from Shift ; input devices for quick &amp; k@@ ile ; a smart line breaks . if the current position is located within a lists environment ( e.g. breaks or it@@ em@@ ize ) ; not only a line breaks but at the same time the command \ \ item .
&quot; inside a tables , connect &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with a \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments under settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; some users can arrange the columns in tables environments and thereby arrange all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; if this tab@@ ulator is not enough , to add the columns to the columns of the current tab@@ ulator . &quot;
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code completion has been installed in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to set special commands ( mostly for lat@@ ex ; ) three different types of modes are working for the automatic failure . all of these modes are set up for different working conditions under settings K@@ ile .
&quot; at the beginning , a new environment through the command \ \ &apos; s { surroundings } will be &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically added the command \ \ end { surroundings } to an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the button bar , the final letter of the input will be removed and m@@ ly missed the list . on the other hand , the list may be reduced by input of another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . descriptions of the descriptions are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , jump stamp will be frozen , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible , and the desired parameters can be frozen . &quot;
among the settings are c@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings for these lists can be made . it can be selected different W@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ungs lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as W@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ents of the general language used .
&quot; command mode is not given for the ful@@ fill@@ ment of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ &apos; s to be entered and the call of completion mode is used as often , that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for completion of environments is provided . &quot;
&quot; when calling the full @-@ time mode , the menus can be automatically folded and the key feature will be automatically folded and it appears to be \ \ &apos; s command . after that , the ambient conditions can be continued and completed by pressing the input bar . &quot;
&quot; after this is completed , the environment will be closed again automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recogni@@ zes that it is a lists of the lists , even a first \ \ item command is used . &quot;
under settings c@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings for this lists are made . this mode uses the full list of ful@@ fil@@ ment mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; ile ; create custom lists of ab@@ dic@@ ts that are replaced immediately by l@@ ashing strings . the lists can be set to the ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ ab file in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
&quot; for example , the letter L entered and the word recovery mode has been instit@@ uted , the letter L + Alt space bar will be replaced by the character chain \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; there are not helpful for the automatic understanding of the year . however , it was found that many W@@ Ã ¶ s are written in a document more than once . that offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the complete list for all already written . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu settings , which can be checked in the menu settings . here , the swelling value can be specified for the display of completion . &quot;
&quot; the full backup files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / un@@ ile / complete / mode / of the Persian Home folder . mode is included in charge ( heating ) , TV ( W@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialogue with graphics are designed for the inser@@ tion of graphics as simple as it is . to know the basics of the graphic formats , the sections should be considered and respected . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for trans@@ itions and re@@ orders of pages . if the PDF edition is fully arranged , then the pages can be arranged with a couple &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to be converted into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to view the result of work , you need to comp@@ ile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed into the menu creation , creating change and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for the comp@@ iling of the source available for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by using Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file in a PS file and using Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; when using the command fast construction , a viewer will usually be called after comp@@ iling . should no built @-@ in viewer , there will be a new window . &quot;
a new project will discuss the project &apos;s new project .... By the following information the project will be asked :
&quot; when you run the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path has to be specified by .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows editing EC@@ MAS@@ cript -@@ Ko@@ de . scripts are administ@@ rated in the vertical bodies .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be found in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; still separate .
the first thing must be said that the configuration environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite balanced system , in which the basic functions are expanded through a variety of variety of packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to under@@ take the user . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ ex ; supplied with many documents . this includes a documentation for the packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference .
&quot; it is a complete re@@ alis@@ z for &amp; tex . it is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; c@@ ile ; it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ as ; / tex@@ as is delivered , the small application tex@@ tual is not always easy ; / texts live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; supplied documents and for a graphical over@@ area . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the green advantage is the search for pack@@ et names or whi@@ st@@ ling . only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space of space key to the viewer .
&quot; ile &amp; k@@ ile ; is a well @-@ friendly and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source text editor that can be used on all systems with installed &amp; K@@ DE ; it is also a part of the Fink project , making &amp; k@@ ile ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command @-@ parts interface , you can create random signatures or daily signals from a list . this command @-@ interface interface provides an input signals for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; &quot;
&quot; for random signatures , any signature is read from the Sign@@ ature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read through many signatures with different quotes , styles and information you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily signals , the same signature is read out of the Sign@@ ature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out for each day , using different signatures as with the random signatures , create unique e @-@ mails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , choose C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . by clicking on the &amp; lt ; blank Sign@@ ature ; if you have entered your signature , save them with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file or click on the disk button . &quot;
&quot; you can create many signatures . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always sufficient signatures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then click on the icon menu or click on the icon with the red cross removing in the tool bar . &quot;
&quot; set the dialog short command . here you can select short commands for menu entries . in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . Click on the right below on the button user and enter the new cran@@ ks@@ haft by pressing the key or key combination . &quot;
&quot; for the use of &amp; c@@ sig ; is &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.5 needed . to add signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program such as &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signal text from the output of an instruction . &quot;
&quot; all available items are listed here . the older the stack @-@ entry is , the lower the frame number is lower . see below . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on a call @-@ on entry in the shown list , the cur@@ sor will be placed in the main window to the appropriate line number of the appropriate file . &quot;

&quot; version 3.2 of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use compression as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t as a sub@@ strate . the combination results quick , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation has been working , knows about it and how much it is . let us put it a graphical interface ! no longer on a terminal , simply click on a graphical interface ; simply click the symbol for the XML processor and ready ! &quot;
&quot; this application is intended for a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is attached to the current working file . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the file &apos;s selection folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time when you &apos;ve launched .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation has already worked , how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface . &quot;
&quot; if the just opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then let it simply select the current working file . if not , then select the current working file and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on screen , your file is fl@@ a@@ wed . please check the reported mistakes and try it again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already marked in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , then it simply leave the current file simply . if not , delete it with current file the co@@ k@@ eting and select it to the checking file using other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the file well @-@ is , please click the Well @-@ Pro@@ review selection . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file selection , choose &amp; DT@@ D ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) and specify the location of the DT@@ D ; and XML ; sch@@ ema , as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG review , the definition of definition UR@@ I ; in file selection is required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the working file in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it &apos;s already marked , then let the current file simply cho@@ oses . if not , remove the selection of current file and select it using the other file file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result is named , the file is usually stored in their home file . &quot;
&quot; plug@@ ins , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , have to do with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you might benefit from the additional functionality and must not wait until someone can use the desired in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used . read more about it below . &quot;
&quot; to install a Plug@@ in or a part , we begin with the menu plug @-@ in . thus , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
this dialogue allows all plug@@ ins to manage and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ ELE@@ MENT in it :
here you can enter the search path . plug@@ in plug@@ ins without a storage location &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on one project several persons in a type of hier@@ arch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the speci@@ fying team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname &apos;s nickname and serves for unique identification .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as Sub@@ project leader . &quot;
the user can choose from the list of members of the team members who he is . this is done by sending the team member from the list and expresses the button S@@ etze as expresses . the currently selected Member ( its Identi@@ fication ) appears bold after you are : text .
nickname and setting of your own identity are important regarding messages and notes . see further information about comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leader when some specific information is happening . see also for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed if something particular happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later , a script would be saved , or a script that will be added to the CV@@ S as soon as they will be added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project settings dialog can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an E@@ Mail will be sent to the add@@ res@@ sor in the add@@ res@@ see list . the add@@ res@@ see may be a team or sub @-@ project head . see in T@@ we@@ i such a ladder .
comments are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
comments can be found . either the note @-@ entry from the editor @-@ text menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a commentary range followed by invitation to text .
remarks can be sent a determin@@ ative member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( part ) is a role in the project of the following possibilities : team leader Ber@@ eich@@ s@@ manager Sub@@ project leader After the Area and Sub@@ project leaders should be led as in the examples below .
&quot; nickname and roll@@ ers names are independent of large or small inclu@@ sions , but spaces around the bra@@ ckets and the note : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ att@@ ing languages which is DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scri@@ p@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are available via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; specific settings are covered , a short description for others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up using settings Qu@@ anta ... to be called . this dialog extends over several sites that are treated with one another .
the behavior of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for tags including car completion can be modified . the entries are :
&quot; large / small description of tags : large / small notes of automatically added tags . normal big / small let@@ tering means that tags are added , as they are described in the daily XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / small @-@ scale attributes of attributes ( size ) : large / small scra@@ p of automatically logged attributes . normal Groß / Klein@@ sch@@ reibung means , the attributes are added as described in the daily XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags : if attached , is optional for tags that is optional for the closing day , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
not optional tags : as above all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
&quot; start and closing date automatically : if enabled , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic setting of accent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acute characters into the appropriate coding during enem@@ a .
&quot; M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to identify different types of files . by default , default settings can be restored . &quot;
standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or in other ways than with file opening files ( where the coding of the file can be over@@ taken ) . but this setting is added to the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . but this setting is added to the project characteristics , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , created regularly backup cou@@ plings , so that at the next start of the program the document can be restored from backup . this is not the same as the saving file is created regularly , according to the set @-@ in time . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can either be displayed either in the editor or own view ( or documentation in a Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ite ) , which makes it possible to look the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
&quot; set the window settings back to the next start is useful , when the user interface has come across from changing the M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depends on views . it corresponds to the --@@ stress layout command parameters . &quot;
the warning messages -@@ section serves the control of the ability to ask the display of war@@ nings by don &apos;t ask any more .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it may display symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ isation behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode . regarding the different modes of modes .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the figure of Par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , can be set in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change through the structure of the structure with the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structural tree settings the visibility of no@@ des can be opened automatically in the tree , the actu@@ alization of the tree that is automatically opened . empty k@@ not are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are found where no element is found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the range of short@@ cuts of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which can be un@@ folded in groups , each can be divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; DT@@ EP ; s valid , there may be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ case uses something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript . &quot;
&quot; here , plug@@ ins are managed by plug@@ ins . plug@@ ins are used by third @-@ site applications which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , on the best @-@ known &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; . inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in must be stated : &quot;
address : the path to plug@@ in if it is not located at a standard there like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information will be delivered to the plug@@ in at the start , so it can open the current file to the associated file ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component of the &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in is ref@@ using to store . only read L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the loading , if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check out the Plug@@ in : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the plug@@ in information is correct . if plug@@ in at the moment is not available , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , trou@@ bles@@ hooting has been completely re@@ developed . the support for the non necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been implemented , as well as the support for d@@ b@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in concept has been implemented , which enables various implem@@ ent@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
currently only one plug @-@ in is available to include the use of &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; In@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert .
&quot; the use of the deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project starts with the selection of a matching deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . in addition to the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in selection field , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a deb@@ ug@@ ger project is activated , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface : &quot;
&quot; a view , displayed in the contents of supervised variables . usually appears in the left Do@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; a view , all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed below . usually appears in the bottom Do@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; a view , shown in the output ( as in HTML ) of the deb@@ ug@@ gers . usually appears in the bottom Do@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the deb@@ ug@@ gers , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this promotion , the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger , if necessary , manufactured , or it shares the Plug@@ in using to Deb@@ ug@@ ger . this promotion is used by default when a project is opened , so that a deb@@ ug@@ ger does not need to be considered in normal case . &quot;
the session to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to deb@@ ug@@ ger or termin@@ ate the foli@@ age according to requirements .
sends an HTTP requirement to the server to initi@@ ate a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger edition .
&quot; deb@@ ug@@ ger points to the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script and information about the surveillance variables as well as the current line is constantly going on . if this is done , the script will continue . when a deb@@ ug@@ an@@ claim is started , the script starts with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; deb@@ ug@@ ger points to the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script without sending information to surveillance variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is done , the execution begins , once a requirement is set . &quot;
&quot; deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script , without going into functions or include . &quot;
&quot; deb@@ ug@@ ger performs the next statement in the script , where possible in functions and includes in@@ correctly . &quot;
&quot; deb@@ ug@@ ger points to the deb@@ ug@@ ger to go over and go to the next so , as if the current does not exist . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialogue in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the surveillance value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialogue , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable . &quot;

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus to your needs and how you can help &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to get better .
&quot; editing packages ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to make support for a@@ up@@ - and scripts ; their simplicity and flexibility is made of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility is made of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the a@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and &amp; CSS ; it consists of two types , the tag languages and file format . day folder are handmade , symbol@@ ise text buttons ( above the edit window ) , the text and instructions can insert faster into a document as a user may be . &quot;
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see also for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; DT@@ EP . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the property dialog@@ s , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; self . tool@@ bars permit a quick insert of tags in a document without any risk of writing errors . &quot;
&quot; day folder are nothing as folder . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day folder carry the name of the descri@@ b@@ able language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML , whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better insight and more information about working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits will be put in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can only contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing more than one element about themselves . &quot;
type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; one argument of the function . ( family 2 )
valid only for the day class class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( family 2 )
valid for the Type Method . are the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 )
&quot; yes , if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ Day . this is a only element type element .
describes a attribute of a tags . this element can only occur only once for each attribute . it tables the name and the type of attribute . additionally , there are other tags to describe how this attribute will be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an only element type element . &quot;
is the source of used used for the attributes in the day editing dialog and the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; will be used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology is within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting edge and a method@@ ology . the arguments that are handed to the method . can be empty or % day@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container day that group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only occur for an attribute description only once . it is an only element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text in a dialog . this day may only occur for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for every field in the dialog box ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is an only element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; - Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog up in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus window , and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , verification only takes place at the loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in the following example , for a family 1 @-@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; ELE@@ MENT from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ scheme . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ atic tag . &quot;
&quot; in this file , an example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; transfer@@ ring function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; &quot; = &quot; function &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; function = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is as quite simple and there is an editor for it , available via DT@@ D @-@ be@@ ite DT@@ D settings ; therefore , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; should be created for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;

a action can be set with settings actions ... click on New Action leads to the same dialog :
this promotion is assigned to the button . with clicking the button user can be assigned a key pendant ; with K@@ one the current key collection is removable .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the det@@ ective settings and insert this text in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that the document can change or use as input ( or parts of the document ) are started . examples of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EPs . &quot;
the first must be specified as the name of the script and interpre@@ ter . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
&quot; although qualified paths are permitted , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ ype variable in command line : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable , which can be used in command line : &quot;
&quot; % f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document , file : / from the document &apos;s name is removed . &quot;
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP will be used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above specified methods , a script input from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus can be sent to the standard input . in the select field entry can be determined what to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful with this attitude .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the selected application can also be diver@@ ted . there are two types of issue : normal edition written on the default issue ; error messages , which should be done on the default edition written by default value : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool bar . in the case it is not too many , so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool bar is added , you must add actions and configure . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the Edit mode .
fill all the necessary fields and add the day to the appropriate tool bar .
&quot; complete all and if the day attributes has and you plan their use , activate dialog &quot; Day , &quot; if available , so that a input when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a domestic symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this icon ? will we replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; menu ; , graphics Show other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 pixels . to change this , select the size other . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all the other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . due to the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as los , star@@ red , further interpreted ) , or should indicate a message to the user that clicking this symbol is added ; it is based on the current document . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this happens to the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; choose the folder , where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the user button and continue with other tags , so there are still which is , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; add functions to the tool bar , or it should set this for a better overview by several groups . open the tool@@ bar dialog on settings tool@@ bar . make sure the required tool@@ bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; I would like to choose the Tren@@ ner ( right up ) for my tool bar . after the selection of the element , which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to choose a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how to support the group@@ ing . someone , who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar , could believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; button on the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool bar must be tested by sample of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; in the correct folder . after new e@@ XML it doesn &apos;t exist , it will be im@@ regular folders , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adapt their tool bar ( s ) , if a file is opened by the appropriate type . &quot;
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language that you like best . therefore this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation @-@ tree for my personal use .
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if someone has done this for you . &quot;
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we need to let the do@@ cr@@ c file to you here .
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c to you = path path , relative to this file , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = 4.@@ html , 2 = # 2 , html @-@ 3 = tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 , = Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html G@@ etting Start@@ ed = Introduction , ... &quot;
&quot; note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that there is no sub@@ folder in tree with its own content . there is no known border for chess tel@@ egra@@ ph ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it yourself . &quot;
note that the table of contents are refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the upper end of the building view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders will be displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention &amp; and lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; tags files are replaced .
&quot; the contents section is the range of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed in writing of the tex@@ ts@@ ens@@ itive help . for example , if when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array function would appear directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file binding lines . &quot;
a simple list of conf@@ using separate context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
&quot; now , you can simply save your file do@@ cr@@ c as well as $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps for local or global use . then you create a folder ( like do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copying your HTML documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these good and value are worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files using a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were not rich in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud of being in the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ating resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can send via email to friends , partners , or else to whom . at different places there will send an email menu entry , as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; resources can be uploaded into our main archive , where all other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , users can download it and only be available if our team needs them as correct and used for the release . in order to make a use@@ full contribution , we recommend the source of resources , both for our team as well as for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked to ask for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys you can read out . in the dialog New resource , the input fields can be empty ( URL preview can be left empty ) and when clicking OK . &quot;
the upload can also upload the DT@@ D DT@@ D @-@ Package ( DT@@ EP ) to upload tool@@ bar tool@@ bar and started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree .
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before the installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource is correct and it can then be broken . if the integrity is given and the resource is set correctly . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message with the statement of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; but the creation can be more time consuming because hundreds of day files can be needed in daily XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D to a DT@@ EP package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D store and Conver@@ ting of a DT@@ D menu . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with DT@@ D description , which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target Record name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition line : the string chain that appear in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE day , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D HTML / / DT@@ D
&quot; the DT@@ EP after the conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; Editor , with details of the newly introduced &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and full benefit from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , you must first put them to these fundamental concepts - without their understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , the working range is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection . this distinction concerns a series of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , is everything that is marked as global in the common folder structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows to secure the group of administ@@ rators different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are available to each in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in user directory , so that they can only use this user personally . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be all of &amp; CSS ; designs up to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a specific project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are put on the folder &apos;s folder and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some key areas : the Edit@@ or@@ window , the construction plans , the cart@@ els with information and tool@@ bars . please suggest in , and for further information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the Kart@@ en@@ iter with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document , re@@ load , delete , or upload the document , jump to an book@@ mark or version of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click menu in the Edit@@ or@@ Area lead to another context menu relating to the processed document content , how basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the file below the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file , if the string can be displayed under the mouse poin@@ ter a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editor , the editor &apos;s tool will be shown . currently , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional as standard , for which a set of tool will be shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool will be adapted to the new functions and therefore connected user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert one day , e.g. &amp; lt ; you want to insert the data for this just one day . now , you can insert the data for this just one day . if you want to insert several attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; building operations ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information on &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open it and pass through . in the presentation with cart@@ ei@@ vers stand for files , project , sample template , documentation structure , scripts , attributes and documentation designs . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view displays all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by a right mouse click . actions such as adding , removal , up@@ loading or delete files from the memory medium can be carried out with the displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; another option of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost anything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what connection it is used . the category depends on the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; global templates are always available , local templates are only usable for the appropriate users and templates in projects . more to templates are available . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available script languages . the concept of the integration in Global , Local and Project is also working here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can get the information on a script . via the right mouse button , you can restart the script , edit or send the script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by left @-@ clicking a element , the cur@@ sor is set to the position of the element of the element . by the right @-@ click of an element , a list of commands in regards to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other construc@@ ts . with it , it can change quickly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . this allows changing the contents of all available attributes with a few cli@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation to web technology for your development . it can be downloaded documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can create your own documentation , and through adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ ei@@ vers on the lower end of the window , can be achieved above the usable information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
this box shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . for example the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this Kart@@ en@@ iter shows all errors in the market up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed will give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
&quot; the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show it on a symbol and they get the appropriate command . the chocolate versions of the tool is the possibility of defin@@ ing their own commands , icons in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with an email . if they receive a tool bar in an email , they can secure it in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; such as any other securing and load ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options to get to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
if you have problems with the start of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that is no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before their bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimised for a rapid web development and combines an advanced development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editing , the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious , ext@@ end@@ able Mark@@ up languages ? well , this would make him an absolutely great web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; therefore it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you define it in &amp; XML ; it should be &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , which should be suitable &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; developer Con@@ gregation is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to expand as they need it for their need . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web development to use a intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can expand productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ painted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars have to be able to draw &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . ( more in this , they find in . ) &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and quickly expanded to an sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in any way associated with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in detail documentation is related to help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta run ) . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently developing and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as MAN@@ T@@ IA am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; you can open a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you can open a file , which will not be taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for later use . watch in the section about templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project prec@@ urs@@ or , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there are contained special characters to the &amp; HTML ; write @-@ in , so they are correctly indicated and not understood by browser as form@@ att@@ ing instruction . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ write , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; it is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day . &quot;
&quot; switch the block selection or out . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key , select text blocks . &quot;
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if you &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions in order to help you .
shows the message window or not at . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
- and switch @-@ off of the problem rep@@ orters at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the problem reporter is activated once you are changing to the structure tree .
shows the symbols of the main window of the main window . this column allows you to place book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sors in the document . &quot;
&quot; book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu , after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents . &quot;
opens an existing project from hard drive . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
&quot; to insert files into the current project , the selected files will then be copied to the project directory . &quot;
&quot; searches the project directory after new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add to the project . &quot;
downloads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have further inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project administ@@ rated . in the chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find details . &quot;
downloads a project tool bar . these are kept in project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
&quot; opens up a dialog to add a new tool bar . this can only be added to the name . actions must be saved by att@@ itudes actions , and you will store the tool to store , whether you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
removes a tool@@ bar from the visible range . this del@@ etes it not from the hard drive . if you don &apos;t have stored the tool@@ bar you will be asked if you want to do that .
&quot; with this , you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool bar is available in the next publication ) . the menu option opens a new case message with the tool bar as app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; allows the upload of tool@@ bars on the main server , where any other can access it . see in . &quot;
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; you have made or any someone else made and convert to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; own PA format .
loading / refres@@ h of the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the removal from the &amp; DT@@ EP ; to renew them without the whole &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this global is not present and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file fails to fail .
&quot; this menu includes a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is menu in the tags that includes the list of tags / actions on this tool bar . &quot;
allow access to the current day integration dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insert of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent insert means that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus uses that this day is ref@@ using to this place the rules .
&quot; in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed below the listed menu points . Click the click of a activated plug @-@ ins activated . &quot;
select the default value mode for the current file . the list of available articles depends on the right ; -@@ version .
select the type of line identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
check the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by the external application tidy .
&quot; immediate switching between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switching mode can sometimes need or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the presentation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu includes an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting a single agreement , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
switches the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialogue influences every application , using the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web brows@@ ers . &quot;
judge the behaviour of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you will find details .
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ kit , or add what can change and follow the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse , but is not implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as in any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the path here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed by the top of the project , as for example , after filling the project called the entire directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here &apos;s the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is automatically completed . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the names of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine to which you want to access , one , except one process local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , default settings of the chosen protocol can be used . depending on the remote machine the remote machine could be required . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder to be stored in the tool for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default , tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards . &quot;
this allows to include files from local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or whole file can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you want to download and change the static web content you want to download and change . with ser@@ ver@@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you need to go different . &quot;
&quot; if a project is to be integrated in the main file of the project , if a project is not started ane@@ w . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main character and you can make an exact selection of good colour . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in main folders . you can select the desired files by anch@@ ors or , by removing the skins , cl@@ amps of the project . &quot;
&quot; the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can also be found in the menu with project properties in the menu Profile , or to be modified with the SH@@ IFT F@@ 7 button . &quot;
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder possible ) used for project related operations like the project folder .
&quot; complem@@ entary option to the above , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signals are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which will be loaded when opening the project . in can read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; thus , the desired deb@@ ug@@ ger can be selected . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information on G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in can be set with the option options . in this case , trou@@ bles@@ hooting is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window profiles , high loads profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as the display of a tree view for each profile , by hands a own design view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see details . &quot;
&quot; in the event window configuration , one can switch event actions and add these actions , change or delete these actions , if a pre @-@ specific event occurs , such as the Si@@ bel@@ s of a file . see in details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project , which was opened , is currently not able to influence . &quot;
&quot; to open a different project , open the project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog Project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus is closed , the project file will automatically be saved . you will be asked if you want to store changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . same happens if you load a new project . &quot;
&quot; the project supervision gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project . &quot;
&quot; folder behave equally , however , the entries are opening and opening together with ... in the right button of the context menu : &quot;
&quot; here , various profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information on the place of highly permitted files . see also : &quot;
&quot; allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent removing the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password is kept in the core memory and forget program . this possibility is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary , and the rather un@@ safe password on the record store does not occur in question . &quot;
&quot; this will stop the transmission , or simply leave the dialog , if you can change your opinion before loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , many high loads profiles are created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when working or creating a profile , this dialogue is displayed : &quot;
&quot; this is the server name , which should be copied onto the files , either a fully qualified domain name or IP address . &quot;
the transfer protocol for high load . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; file ( local ) and NFS .
&quot; the port for transfer . usually it does not need to be changed , except the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . use it to your discretion . the password is saved on the plate , so it can &apos;t be easily read , but everyone with programm@@ ers can see it easily in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , that is , through simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the current open files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored in the menu project or the project tool bar , accessible via att@@ achments tool tool@@ bar , open or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this does not only boost productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the own working mode . &quot;
&quot; as already mentioned above , tool holders in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; best on the menu tools can be stacked . use and add the tool to add the tool@@ bars below in the section adding of tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar and the symbols can be set either by using the context menu ( right click on the tool bar ) , which can be set up in the new action , a new tool bar , which can be specified in the dialog , which can be specified in the dialog , which can be displayed on this or other tool . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additionally the entries will remove action and promotion has been shown that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the tool bar and the actions on them can set up menu , set up menu and set settings . &quot;
&quot; templates are used in essential document@@ ette , code Schnitz@@ el and files to link . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates in principle as a common file system with extended organisation and interfaces . you can connect , post@@ p@@ one or each other in the system existing directory in the pre @-@ storage room . templates are in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you need for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified in the beginning of each template .
&quot; binary is everything that is not pur@@ er text . there can be any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; b , Flash files &amp; etc ; binding . binary templates are usually included in documents via direct lin@@ ings ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples of the templates are available in the pre @-@ storage room . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created by any text document type . based on this templates , new documents can be created . normally , specialized documents can be created in corresponding signatures . some examples can be found in the same way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the storage room below global templates . see in for more information on templates . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful , if not a new document has been added on a template but the same text area always to be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final score up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ as@@ cript or Perl base . some examples are available in the stock room under global templates . see in for more information on templates . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates for whole websites serve as templates . they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there is no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure to Belie@@ ve ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose File As a presentation , save as local template .... &quot;
&quot; as soon as it is done , note that ( even if it was stored in the project ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the stock room under project management . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document , and click on file as a template store choice as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be drawn with drag and breakdown to the building view templates . &quot;
&quot; the compilation of binary templates is simple : the file is simply copying only into a template folder . it can be used to use all file management functions , such as pulling and inser@@ ting or insert the file @-@ tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can set up in the file @-@ tree or in the project files , click on a folder on the right and secure Site template , will secure a name for the template and secure it by default , but of course it can be saved as local or global presentation . &quot;
&quot; project transactions allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can add head@@ lines and foot@@ er lines or link dynamic with &amp; PHP ; to create files , insert files , or link them with them . additionally , you can keep some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
&quot; the super@@ structure of the sub@@ window templates is based on the files in the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / templates and templates . each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers , as explained above . &quot;
to select the behavior of a folder in the template list with the right mouse button on the folders and select the context menu features . the following dialog appears :
&quot; a select field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded , as soon as the attributes of attributes . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits for everything except for regular folders . if a regular folder would be dis@@ able , it would be explicitly activated in this path unless they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text structure . if nothing appears , you probably find in a regular folders . &quot;
&quot; allows or displayed text for templates in this folder . this could be General Head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a particular project , and enables copying contents to a specific head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines already with matching head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can also use the context menu ( indicate the right mouse button ) via a complete command line for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that are available via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source code through the V@@ PL ; editor and the second shares the editor window in two parts : the source editor and V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it downloads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; - page and an cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit editing and if required for the source code editor , in which the source code is visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor on a document , the &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ en@@ ames of &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; Editor . there is no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly as the first , except that at the same time the changes in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously running . with pressing F@@ 9 this mode is already active , this mode is activated for the active cur@@ sor from a window to others , whereby the position is kept in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta .... After choosing V@@ PL ; -@@ view , you can set between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatically . in general , the recommendation is : a small sp@@ ying for fast calcul@@ ator and a large pot for slow PC . &quot;
&quot; assuming that you want to change the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags is possible at work with the V@@ PL ; Editor @-@ dialog is also called upon , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also called . this allows you to change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a @-@ tags throws the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. key words for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list enables the change of content , e.g. key words on the column name and key word key words . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of view from the browser . you can add CSS rules using the buttons below the list or delete a change via the list is not currently supported by CSS rules .
&quot; it is possible to insert an external CSS style , by clicking on the file button and select the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the cur@@ sors is unique as in a word processing , possible because of the arrows , possible . in rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor is unique . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted by reset or removal . &quot;
&quot; tags will be done in the same way via the tool@@ box , as in the source code Editor . it is to be noted that the inser@@ tion of tags is not removed before existing tags , e.g. if an anchor tag , surround with text , each other bo@@ oming anchor day must be removed . &quot;
some tool@@ bars like the tables assistant or the lists of lists are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release must be used for tables or lists tools .
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of styles . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for certain elements is possible and the design of style can be followed . &quot;
&quot; to manage &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compiled except &amp; K@@ DE ; yet the lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t libraries , li@@ be@@ x@@ sl@@ t and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are available at a typical installation of &amp; K@@ DE ; already available . &quot;

&quot; in this command , a partial or entire agreement with a pre@@ age called QNAP ME or a specified module name is checked . &amp; eg ; template is correct with each QNAP ME , which contains the string template . &quot;

there are many graphical tools in the same . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I have written .
&quot; the merge was very complicated because one of the Beit@@ er corrected many changes , and at the same time , another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts with mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; the program used to me only the changed rows , but I could not see what changed in these lines . and there was no hin@@ ts to the places where perhaps only the breakdown had changed . the combination of these changes was a little night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be differences within one line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful features were added later .
&quot; for example , if you like to compare text , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it into one of the compar@@ ative window . &quot;
a function which made a lot of work was the same and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
&quot; also 3 @-@ way @-@ merge is fully supported . this is useful if two persons can work independently of each other on a piece of co@@ des and changes changes . the original file ( the basis ) helps to edit the resolution . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen photo shows three Qu@@ ell files while mer@@ ging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also with the same and merge complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; diff@@ 3 ; when folders merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and im@@ it@@ ates the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check co@@ de , you will like this function . &quot;
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters you can see that at a glance at the summary of the column at the left side . ( no trouble anymore if anyone changes the breakdown . )
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates what file is different . red color means that both files are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can simpli@@ fy the typ@@ ing work by using only the file names of the first file completely . example : &quot;
&quot; diff@@ 3 folder folders , diff@@ 3 folder folders , diff@@ 3 folder folder folders , folder 2 folder folder folder folder , folder 3 folder folders &quot;
&quot; opening dialog allows manual setting of fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or select a recently opened file from the list of open@@ er . the opening dialog starts your selection and shows them at the next time ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed . &quot;
&quot; using the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the same or merge folders will be selected , for B and C , however , uses a folder , then uses &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if mer@@ ges are crossed , the input field is active for target and can be edit . however , it is not necessarily required to store an output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text compare . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active compar@@ ative window . compared to open dialogue , you can easily connect the dialog with the shut@@ down button . &quot;
you can also use pulling and shut@@ down : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a compar@@ ative window .
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains a file , e.g. several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these features are , you would need to download and compare these relevant sections . now , you can simply copy the relevant sections , and then compare it . &quot;
note : currently you can pull out of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; draw out only the drop of text in a compar@@ ative window .
&quot; warning : some editors may interpre@@ t the pulling and put text into another program as cut and insert ( instead of copying and inser@@ ts ) . in such cases , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B , C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional ) , let the mouse pass a while over the line . then a small relief window will show the full name . &quot;
&quot; the three source holders are assigned to the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B , green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pre@@ ferences can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , one sees the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) well . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the text , the summary column is displayed . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( C / C + + for example , white characters are relevant in strings and comments , rare cases ) . &quot;
&quot; the vertical line that separates the summary column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the source file is not activated . if the line is activated , the line is presented to broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the results of the results ( under comparison list ) also has a info line with the inscription output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have handled the result . usually , it contains the automatic merge already text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
&quot; ! ! ! until all conflicts have been dissolved , the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the next resolution / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two compar@@ ators are used , any difference simultaneously , a conflict of manually has to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window , the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will appear in the windows that the current group will appear in the windows . it will appear with the color background colour to the left and on the left , a black beam appears . &quot;
&quot; sometimes thanks to the automatic merge or through manual work , no further line left in the group ; then it is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your opinion or maybe another source . this text appears not in the final saved file , nor in a mark that you might want to copy and elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; Conver@@ ts , however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the results window . go carefully with this feature . &quot;
&quot; note : if when selecting the sources , check the options numbers , or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments are treated as white signs . &quot;
&quot; navigate with the image load and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the window , you can also use the arrow keys to the right , si@@ w like you can also use it from other programs . the transfer column next to the vertical image bar can also be used by clicking and navigate to navigation . &quot;
&quot; in the eye window , you can also use the other keys to work . with insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ writ@@ able mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
&quot; a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary @-@ columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows on the beginning of each group ( as mentioned in paragraph , and expl@@ aining the ed@@ itable output window ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool bar includes seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ bottom / Str@@ g picture ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture down@@ ward / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , you must solve between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g inser@@ ts ) . if this option is enabled , you will copy automatically to the cli@@ p@@ board and manual copying . be careful with this option , because you might accid@@ entally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line versions are stored in accordance with the operating system used . UNIX variants use a line @-@ feed indication \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car back@@ drop + Z@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ ak \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 ret@@ ains the line output of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also use binary files . &quot;
the options and list of the last used files will be stored automatically and re@@ produced at the next start . ( menu setting in@@ gen@@ - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; choose a let@@ tering with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialogue also sets the scriptures with variable width to choose from , but you should not use this . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences in ital@@ ic writing will be displayed . if the chosen scripture cannot support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rounded . on these systems , the button default settings will automatically be an odd colour . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , when pressing the tab button , the appropriate number of spaces inserted . otherwise , a table character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when entering or return , the resulting line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copy into the cli@@ p@@ board then . &quot;
you can select which type @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally common selection on the operating system used .
&quot; during the compar@@ isons of files , &amp; diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be found in the source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es white signs . in this step , white characters are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car back@@ sign &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others will only look like a Z@@ eil@@ en@@ cir@@ cled &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , but then they could save files with different sizes in page @-@ to @-@ page comparison , but then you could be disabled by different sizes . during the combination , this option must be disabled . in default , this option is de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters are ignored ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result , the differences are nevertheless indicated , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as modifications in white signs . &quot;
&quot; intensive after even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the automatic jump mode , this setting is determined as long as the result of the selection is displayed before the next ung@@ od@@ est conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; delete all conflicts in white signs by the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important . note that the automatic selection also requires conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options are ignored in numbers or comments , if the options are ignor@@ ing or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . &quot;
&quot; these options are treated in the chapter to scanning files , and execute a mer@@ ging . see for details under documentation about the directory comparison and mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original box . if already a such backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , this will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
adap@@ ting the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; end and restart the change . ( this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set over the control centre . )
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , all entries are used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; via the selection fields for encoding fields , a short note , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely inform@@ al character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file coding for source files . this affects , how special characters can be treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can click here which coding to save is to be used . &quot;
&quot; if you define the processing command , they may not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the processing command can be set only with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option , you can define the encoding of the output processing command . &quot;
&quot; turn this off to supp@@ ress the additions of changes in white characters in text or over@@ sight . ( note : this applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are ignor@@ ing or ignore C / C + + comments are enabled . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a colour coded excess column . but sometimes you want to see only the differences between two of three files . according to selection of A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , besides the normal still a second transfer column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply remove the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison window side by side or over one another . this can also be useful for advertis@@ ements of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to assemble the files together . current file sharing the merge menu , then , if you use only two files . a simple click starts the merge file as default , then the name of the last source file is used as default , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will pass first to this external command . in &amp; diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor , that is exactly the file itself . for example , you can use b@@ illing parts or correct the rec@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be given first to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of command will only be used at the line . you can only write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds to your requirements . each input line must have an associated issue line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to enable users more flexibility when setting the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users don &apos;t want to program that . good news is , however , that in most cases were sed or per@@ l perfectly . &quot;
use this pre@@ fabri@@ cation command to convert the input in large letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; walk in the found text in upper case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to insert the text file ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed experiment , you may begin to understand it and maybe you may actually like this regular expressions . you are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further processing command for Z@@ eil@@ l . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several features at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements from each other . example :
&quot; instead , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switches &quot; However , per@@ l some details are different from per@@ l . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
&quot; the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and merge . further operations change only the data , which sees the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the line @-@ off @-@ processor looks the output of the normal pre @-@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the micro@@ processor commands are very useful but , as in any function , the text changes or differences , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively compare and merged . &quot;
... makes a proposal to merge ; you can adapt the proposal before the start
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without being really performed
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key )
this is similar to the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of individual files . you need to open a folder on the command line or dialog file .
&quot; when three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as a basis . if no target file was given , uses &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders will not start automatically , do not merge the merge . select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during the reading of the folder you can read a little news window on the current progress . if you cancel the scanning the folder , only the files are listed , which have been compared to then . &quot;
&quot; when the scanning is completed , it shows &amp; diff@@ 3 ; a list of catalog with results on the left , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and any folder was found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure will normally be folded together . you can click a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or click on the object or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory menu includes two functions of all sub@@ directories , and check out all sub@@ directories with which you can collect all the folders . &quot;
&quot; if you click on a file , the file comparison will start and it appears a compar@@ ative window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folder , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the assembly action can not be activated automatically . if the combination is started , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colours red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; in identical entries , the color is identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical when their total content is identical . then you also have the same color . with folders the age is un@@ significantly for its colour .
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . colours reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C is identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if there exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( for example , if A file and B is one file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such defective objects may not be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( for example , if A file and B is one file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such defective objects can exist , the interaction cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode to synchron@@ ize is active when only two folders and no explic@@ it target file is specified , then select &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... &quot; A and B exist , but not the same are : merge and result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; directly after meeting , copied &amp; diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot;
&quot; if two folders will be merged and select the new file instead of merge ( un@@ safe ) , then exam@@ ines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files are different , but the same date will appear , but the same date may be identical but the same date is identical .. Sol@@ ving such mistakes can not be started , the mer@@ ging of the file cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during the merge , a file after the other is working . it &apos;s status @-@ column is ready to run when the merge has been successful , and according to other messages when the merge has been completed , you should make a final review and see if the status is ok . &quot;
&quot; if in setup dialog the file compar@@ ative method is chosen , K@@ Diff@@ 3 further columns indicate . these contain the number of un@@ sol@@ dered , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders compared or combined . ) &quot;
&quot; you can merge either the only selected entry ( file or O@@ dner ) , or all entries must be selected ( even in all sub@@ titles ) , you can launch the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have no target file , then in the three @-@ file merge mode C is used as a target , when using two @-@ folders merge , A and / or B will be used as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen a target folder , please check if all entries can be displayed in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options through the certain entries must be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises : &quot;
to bring all entries together : select directories / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key collection ) to bring the action to the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if using conflic@@ ting file types still exist un@@ invali@@ d actions , a message appears on the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you bring together all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options , sim@@ ulate , and break down . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see if you want to see what would happen , without any changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual operation is necessary ( together with a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( see screen photo ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are finished with a file , select once again run directories / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved any dialog box appears , then leads an appropriate dialog . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error message appears a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some errors that will help you to run the cause of the problem . so , you have the option to select any other action on the entry or solve the problem in any way before you continue with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were individually combined , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and performs it in later together all entries are not repeated . even if you &apos;re changing the merge , these entries will again be merged . &quot;
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
&quot; only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the elem@@ ental tree . several patterns can be entered into the elem@@ ental tree . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not correspond to this pattern . &quot;
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the elem@@ ental tree . it can be entered by more than one pattern ; use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the elem@@ ental tree . it can be entered by more than one pattern ; use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .@@ c@@ v@@ signals file . ( see below info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , one file is marked as conce@@ aled . this option lets you decide if these files are displayed in the elem@@ ental tree or not . this option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links indicate . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to folders : if the option is switched off , the links are treated as normal folder and recur@@ sively searches . ( note that &amp; diff@@ 3 ; if the option is switched on , the links lead to a final loop would lead to yourself and diff@@ use diff@@ 3 ; ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis of any file through and shows the statistics @-@ columns . ( the number of dissolved , ung@@ sters , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folder via a slow network , it may be faster , only the change date and the file size is to be compared with caution . please use caution . this option is checked in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to trust the change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical , when copying the change date . please use attention when copying the change date . please note with caution . this option is checked in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no target file specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in both folders . this option is switched off in the default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as promotion . ( this will be considered in@@ secure , because it is assumed that the other file is not changed . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted by another file , then the original backup file is already changed , then this is automatically deleted . if an old backup file has been deleted with the .@@ original extension , it does not only merge the merge full folder . this option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder @-@ merge display remains visible to the merge file . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window directory , turn the main window in the window menu and switch the switch between directory &amp; text windows between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ click . however , in the directory menu , you can also install a single file directly without the folder . as soon as you save the result , the status will be done correctly and the file will not be merged when you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you read the directory again : directory menu : new ein@@ read &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open files on local or remote computers . &quot;
&quot; the first command line is compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line is compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive , with a local file . &quot;
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls . these are always absolute .
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes using the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
or it can &apos;t be distinguished whether a link shows on a file or file . then always one file is accepted as link goal . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot;
there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or change of change . therefore vary the per@@ missions and change of change from the original . ( note that this is only possible with local files . )
&quot; the main purpose purpose is currently as a differences viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op is always starting to start the built @-@ in differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . in order to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
normally requires &amp; diff@@ 3 ; two complete input file . if it is used as a K@@ Part 1 patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . then it takes &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch will start to restore the missing file .
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work unless the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since generation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the combination or compar@@ ing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ ist it compass ) exist already . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge such as diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I &apos;ve been using GP@@ L programs very long and have learned a lot in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programm@@ ers who have gone this way or go to it so .
&quot; you probably compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably won &apos;t be the correct PRE@@ F@@ IX to K@@ DE . in default , K@@ DE will not find resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you can find more information about this subject . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be treated as identical ; but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines , next to Each Other , this is more than the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor does not notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict by clicking on the source file and select the button A / B / C , but it &apos;s too much effort to design your own file format , which could store this information . &quot;
&quot; the effort for this was so far too big . you can always use a certain version always through the outputs of a source A / B / C . to edit bigger amounts of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text does not extingu@@ ish . what does it mean , and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors for raising differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using , and lack the purpose . please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and trouble reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . thank you !
to use all the functions of &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or later .
&quot; for information , how you can use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage . &quot;
a list of recent changes you will find under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell Package .
to comp@@ ile and install on a system with &amp; K@@ DE ; to comp@@ ile and install the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folders in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are uns@@ afe you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; mail@@ ing@@ lists of it . &quot;
&quot; cut the text from the cli@@ p@@ board and delete the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Um@@ sch@@ alt insert ) , insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marker . &quot;
&quot; only differences are shown : files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re@@ locate changes to these options with the functionality . ) &quot;
&quot; there are only entries to be displayed in the target file . if the target file doesn &apos;t contain these files , they are missing after merge . ( the behaviour will be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose from the source with the lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window is attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are already present ) , they will be removed when clicking on the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . under@@ shoot in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a miniature preview of all virtual environments . it is quite convenient to change the current programs on the work@@ space , change their size , to stop it or move it . this works both within a working area than with several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual environments , as well as the current applications . applications can be selected and even moved on working area and to others . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible in both working area and other work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; the context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu shows the symbol and the name of application as well as entries , maxim@@ ize , working area and loading . the commands do the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . only if it was cli@@ cked on a application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only if it was cli@@ cked on a application .
&quot; if this check box is marked , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the name of the virtual environments are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual environments are shown , it is equipped with name , will be given the name with ordin@@ arily numbers , and eg ; 1 . working area . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each work@@ space is also displayed as a background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty work@@ space are displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . icon shows a small view of the program icon . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager shall be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager will appear ; in a 2x@@ n pitch , all virtual work@@ spaces appear in a horizontal row and vertical in a vertical set , which is very good for the presentation at the side of the desktop . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size to display windows as symbols or with their content . in addition , it runs out of the control bar . &quot;
to set the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and selecting switching switch ... lets the dialog settings appear .
&quot; at the moment it cannot be changed in the dialog settings , but you can do it manually : &quot;
&quot; you can open the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ c file with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you have no write permission for the file , you need to register as users root or apply to your system administrator . in this file you must specify the key win@@ dow@@ transparent mode and indicate that value . possible values are : &quot;
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base is necessary you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; is a very efficient application , which constantly extends for new functions . it is optimised for use on high @-@ performance computers . &quot;
&quot; if you &amp; I like ; boot , a window appears as above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag , shows the enlarged section of the screen . in the following this window is displayed as an enlargement window .. The image that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged section of the screen and is referred to as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting is enlarged &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter , like an movable magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can view &amp; k@@ mag ; to illustr@@ ate a selected screen in the magni@@ fying window ( selection process mode ) or the area of the mouse poin@@ ter on the screen ( eg ; on the left ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the form of mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse , and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window , and hold on the left mouse button , then you can move the contents of the magni@@ fying rod and move . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; press and use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , in a file , to file the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more . &quot;
starts and stops the updating of the updating . the stop of updating updating the required CPU time against 0 .
&quot; select the Update rate ( Very low , low , Medium , Ho@@ ch , Very high ) . the higher the Update rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot;

&quot; may also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen saver . you can use &amp; stick@@ fier ; to use a range of screen , so you would use a magni@@ fying glass in order to view the small printed in a newspaper or photo . this application is for various people of use : from resear@@ ching or artist to web designer or vis@@ ually handic@@ apped . &quot;

&amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive motion @-@ in@@ tra @-@ syndrome ) and all the mouse click pain .
&quot; &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , em@@ ulate a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people suffering the repet@@ itive motion In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and which every mouse click p@@ ains . moreover , it requires a little exercise . &quot;
&quot; &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle pain that arises when clicking the mouse , and helps many people using the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can find pain when using your computer . unfortunately , you should look up a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to tell it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to avoid pain when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the mouse because of the mouse : the result can fall for everyone differently . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movement and leads to a mouse click when you break the movement briefly .
&quot; the intelligent drive is enabled , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after the pressing of the mouse button . move it to the end of the movement before leaving the mouse button . the intelligent shifting requires a little exercise , but you get used quickly . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the mouse movement , this ref@@ us@@ ement must suff@@ ice before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es is enabled , the turning time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after lowering the mouse button , before the mouse button is extingu@@ ished , if there is no evidence because of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click by mouse shift . is this function activated , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow motion to the left and back leads to double click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt but the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can use &amp; K@@ DE ; to move the reaction time to reduce the reaction time . open on Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab . there is a sh@@ ber@@ eg@@ ler sound buffer , which you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; start at each start of &amp; K@@ DE ; this function is currently only under &amp; K@@ DE ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please click the respective documentation to find out how you will automatically start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; if you have set all the settings back to the dialog , you have already pressed the button to open the dialog . you have already pressed the button on the stand after the last pressures of users . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first to use the settings . in particular , the intelligent move should be turned off first . if you are then connected to the automatic mouse click later , you can take the intelligent move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; K@@ DE ; at sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of what places a mou@@ sec@@ lick is without effect : clicking on the neutral density of windows or on places in the browser window that doesn &apos;t lead to un@@ intenti@@ onally reactions . you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse ru@@ ck@@ les , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you have to take out the mouse ball . as it happens is mouse to mouse differently . however , it should be quickly clear if you see the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt can be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or finger nails . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system opens the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started the intelligent drive , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , meaning that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation cannot finish any more by rele@@ asing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run yourself a mouse click . this is reset by the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse cli@@ cks and sets the cur@@ sor to another spot . &quot;
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor position to place where you want to make it . but use the mouse on a neutral area of working area if you don &apos;t want to make sure that the mouse click on a neutral domain . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter . secure zones for mouse tools and menus and cover lines from windows .
&quot; I try to work with intelligent move , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; intelligent shifting is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs its time before you can cope with it . it is very probably possible to insert it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add each other action , where you will probably cause problems with pressing mouse button . but there are some advice on this : &quot;
&quot; do not use intelligent shifting , if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool to use . mark text instead as follows : take a mouse button at the end of the text area and hold the switch button to the other end of the text , and hold the mouse button on the other end of the text . &quot;
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this enables every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is pressing a sound like a mouse click . so you can use intelligent drive too without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but it requires some exercise .
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use , the X@@ Test extension must be installed for &amp; X window ; it should be the case on most system already . &quot;
&quot; the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse cli@@ cks is only available , if the system has a sound card and speakers , and these are set correctly . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; operated the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointing short . this program has been developed for people suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome , and to whom the mouse has been prepared . &quot;
&quot; &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to be configured , that there is a certain time that a pulling process starts off before the mouse button will be started . in this way , drag and installation with the mouse can be carried out . &quot;

&quot; set up with the menu entry settings , set up ... open the dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog includes two flash@@ cards , speech output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ restrial and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of mapping voice output , enter the command to the command of the language . in the select field under the input field , enter the codes with the text to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text , select the check box if the text will remain unchanged as standard input on the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will continue as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to speech output depends on your language generator . in this command you will find in the documentation about your language generator . examples of this command can be found in app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; as the first attempt to use as a voice service &amp; k@@ mouth ; as first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD speech . if this is successful , further settings are available on this page . the kt@@ i language service is a standardized interface for speech output and which is currently not installed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after the selection of text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard text or by choosing a text passage in the menu text password or in the glue for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of So@@ on , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted into the default space . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is initially entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection box , you can define the editing holder for text password ? you can automatically determine whether the textbook book will be stored automatically . &quot;
&quot; save the book by selecting text password , the book will not be saved . if you select any changes , the textbook book will not be saved . you can ask whether the text password will be stored . &quot;
&quot; the site Wor@@ ship &apos;s site contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the application areas . in the main window , next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection field , you can select the currently used dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add dic@@ tion@@ aries to change the order of books , or export them into a file . below the list you can set up the language and select the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; for this source , choose the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is determined simply by counting of the occurr@@ ence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert just correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how it should be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; this option lets you create a new , empty dictionary , without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly added words automatically create in the dictionary , create an dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
the main window of the window to edit text pass@@ ag@@ gers is double @-@ divided . in the upper part the text pass@@ ag@@ ter are presented as a tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you select a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated key@@ note . if you select a text password , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected word passages and books , can either be accessed by selecting in the menu bar , in the tool bar or via a folding menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text passages or text passages , you can change by drag the mouse to the new spot , or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , the text section is selected , otherwise the selected areas of the s@@ wap can be selected . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , the text section is selected , otherwise the selected areas of the s@@ wap can be used . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used otherwise , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the s@@ wap can be used . &quot;
this menu entry is enabled by a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool bar is arranged by default via the editing window directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the scra@@ ped left side and draw the tool@@ bar can be moved to another position .
&quot; this menu entry is included , a narrow glue at the lower part of the main window with hin@@ ts about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is enabled , a sliding glue for text matching window with entries is indicated . by mouse click on the d@@ art@@ ed left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another position . &quot;
&quot; probably you have not entered the command for the speech output correctly or not completely entered . open Settings ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for the speech output on the card output . ( see section dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to further details . ) &quot;
&quot; it is a language edition of the Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch is supported . license allows it to use festival free and continue without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; for example , to show a command line for setting the speech output , it is assumed that Festival / us@@ r / local / festival is installed . the command to the speech output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a voice system in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free and continue without restrictions .
&quot; for example , to show a command line for the installation of speech output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the file / us@@ r / local / friends . the speech is then possible with one of the three command samples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the data must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . he conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ emen into a Wav@@ e@@ at@@ ei . therefore you need an additional program to use the text in phon@@ em@@ es . license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text in phon@@ em@@ es to MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / us@@ r / local / sul@@ r / local / m@@ bro@@ la installed . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax loves the last sign of the text so that an additional sign must be added . therefore , the full command is therefore more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( CAT ) ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / us@@ r / local / m@@ bro@@ la / / us@@ r / local / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / / / / mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option is to be switched on as default .
the voice of voice d@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ further language service provided by all &amp; K@@ DE ; applications is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different language output systems .
&quot; since the setup of the language can only be performed in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a voice service as voice services in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to setting the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully utili@@ ze , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires approximately 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for voice generator ) , but that depends on your computer and configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , text by the calcul@@ ator . it will be saved by a list already saved phr@@ ases that the user can always be rest@@ art@@ ed again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer . on the computer you need to be a syn@@ thesizer installed .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL to the address bar of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; one or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the speech output system of &amp; K@@ DE ; - is one of modules existing service that allows each application to read text about the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; K@@ DE ; it is a common application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; programm@@ ers ready to be equipped with the applications with the T@@ TS capabilities . also users can offer interesting options .
read texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications is embedded .
&quot; the speech output takes place over the program &apos;s speech disp@@ at@@ cher , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the creation of language editions on the command line ( or shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; program program .
&quot; in the future : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the Language Edition Service of &amp; K@@ DE ; , an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ bus ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d about kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts of it .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; with which a text file can be completely or partially read .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ops ; in the K@@ DE Acc@@ essi@@ bility mailing list . developers can also find the list about htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you need to install the program of speech disp@@ at@@ cher and adjust correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; during the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as yet no speaker is set up , the card card will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card Card is generally displayed . see also . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer various languages and voices , such as various male or female , or those who are able to set up in volume or speed . you should also use multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should use at least one speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise the program @-@ speed disp@@ at@@ cher uses the standard speaker . &quot;
various speakers for the same syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable to several printers for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the speaker card reader in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card speaker is displayed . this also appears when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and yet no speaker is set up . &quot;
all actors already appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear on top of the list . the top performer is used for the speech output if there is no narr@@ ator .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , choose a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker at the list on the list . the order of actors in the list is also determined their priority . &quot;
Click on one of these buttons to turn your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
&quot; select a voice type , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a jun@@ gen@@ - and girls . &quot;
&quot; when you click here , the new speaker is on the card speaker . to change the settings of this talk , click on Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops . go back to map and check if speech output is required ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so the T@@ TS @-@ Service of &amp; K@@ DE ; starts to read text , click to create text orders to create and manage files . see also here . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language play@@ system of &amp; K@@ DE ; click on the box card in general to open this card card . here you can set up some general options . &quot;
&quot; mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this is the start of the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , your card will start to create and read text entries and read the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; K@@ DE ; disabled . &quot;
when kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is termin@@ ated and rec@@ lining ; further if the box is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
&quot; if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the reading is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can start text orders , stop , stop and recording . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; cli@@ p@@ board read or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job . &quot;
&quot; Click on App@@ den or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the board card orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map box and cross language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read the text of the displayed website . check out the text that should be read and select in the main menu tools text . after a short time , the speech should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always convenient to mark the required text of a web page . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre@@ ten@@ er and other un@@ visible stamps are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read the text first . check out the text , which should be read and select in the main menu tools text . then , the voice edition should start . &quot;
this works even if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta .
K@@ emer@@ al is the news system of &amp; K@@ DE ; that you will notify me of fixed events . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ops .
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can set up different types of messages . you can notify different types of messages , for example , you can notify me when in an IR@@ C channel , you can inform yourself in the IR@@ C message . with &amp; gt ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; program K@@ emer@@ al , a menu entry Not@@ ification Settings menu will appear in the menu settings . here are possible settings for K@@ emer@@ al differ according to application . &quot;
&quot; filter for string tan@@ gible replacement offer a good option in &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . you removes the tags b@@ r and b out of the messages that is sent , and in addition to the expression / local / In@@ box , as it can be accepted as provided in most cases . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ops ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filtering the text is processed before it is sent to the program of speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for the improvement of pron@@ unci@@ ation , to use false speech or abbrevi@@ ations , or to circum@@ vent certain defects of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the methods of filtering , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; gt ; distingu@@ ishes four kinds of texts . &quot;
&quot; the Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern Edition has the highest priority . it will be drawn up to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the edition of the Screen Reader is pre @-@ read , the orders received again . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is used to hot . a warning has prec@@ e@@ dence and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the warning of the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application that enters news . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website you can welcome to the room . &amp; K@@ DE ; noti@@ fications are also news . read more .
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . any commission that you encounter from card orders is a text contract . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that are used to record applications . text entries are intended for the output longer texts , which have no special dr@@ en@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are working in qu@@ eue , with the exception of the edition of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen @-@ reader while &amp; gt ; just one such pre @-@ reading , this issue will stop and termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ars . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders , and on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News . &quot;
filters process the text and give it to the next filters . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are done as modules . in the future there can be further kinds of filters .
&quot; drawing string tra@@ iling replace parts of a text by other text . which allows you to set up parts of text or as a regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is used with pre @-@ defined string tra@@ ilers , which enable the creation of messages from &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the scope of delivery &amp; files ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with speaker @-@ selection filters , you can depend on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . if you have set a female voice at an example , you can read text by K@@ DE messages . read more about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters is adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter does not apply its rules , he gives the text unchanged at the next filters . &quot;
&quot; when a text contract , a message , warning , or a &amp; K@@ DE ; notification ; sent to &amp; kt@@ ops ; sent them through all activated filters , which are arranged on the side down . machining through the filter takes place in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
this shows the list of all normal filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be re@@ activated after down@@ wards down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; Click here to insert a new filter . select the type of fil@@ ters , and it will be displayed next below . &quot;
&quot; for installation of string ch@@ ained filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison pattern . if this pattern is found in the text , the text will be exchanged against the appropriate replacement text . &quot;
&quot; for your filters , enter a name . you can choose any name you can only distinguish themselves from the name of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text containing the strings in the column agreement and replacing it in accordance with the drawing chain from the column . the list is displayed in the shown sequence from top to bottom .
Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expressions out of a file that store the current list or delete a list of file , the entries from the file is attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered , the filter is only applied if the speaker for the text order has been shown here . Click on the button to show a list of languages . you can also press multiple languages when you click the click button . &quot;
&quot; here is a value set , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . for example , you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
the application ID running programs will get you with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers must @-@ leave you . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 may only be copied .
&quot; the string ch@@ ained filter is applied only to the text , if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ eses filter apply when match . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the characters can use regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s word \ \ s word \ \ s word ( spaces ) must be limited both on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find no guidance for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; code &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regul@@ ations@@ &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular and # 160 ; regular expressions can be found in the am@@ big@@ u@@ ti@@ ls package . &quot;
&quot; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such modifications . it can only be applied on well @-@ shaped XML . the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker @-@ selection filters you can send lyrics to a specific speaker , which is set on the card card speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can define the text by using a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; gt ; a text to the filter gives it a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker properties , which gives the program the lyrics to &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker is selected by the speaker card reader . with the speaker @-@ selection process you can over@@ write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is registered , the filter is applied if the text contains the specified regular expression , if the text is added to the value of the &amp; K@@ DE ; code &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regul@@ ators , you can get this with one click on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you can set the properties of the desired microphone requirements . if the text met the above @-@ shown filter conditions , the speaker is selected to show the desired requirements at the next level . Click on the button right to preview the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to save , store or delete all settings . &quot;
&quot; the speaker @-@ selection filter is applied only to the text , if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ eses filter apply if applicable . you need to apply at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the speech output API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; to give the programmer its applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; gt ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used . &quot;
the following section includes a short description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ bus ; interface of the language version API by &amp; K@@ DE ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is is available at K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get syn@@ thesizer for my speech ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ form@@ aldehy@@ de filter , but when using the module for Festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone , so that S@@ able does not work at all . do not need to do that if you do not need this voice to read web pages . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and over the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
certain signs or inter@@ section characters appear to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers so that whole pro@@ positions will ski@@ p or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sch . what can I do against it ?
&quot; first , make sure that the character encoding is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , you may possibly be fixed by a string bi@@ dding filter . see . &quot;

&quot; the program &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses an custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you like &amp; gt ; for use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , use the development team in conjunction with the development team . &quot;
&quot; the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; c@@ ert ; to comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages of deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you refer to the source texts of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ e , or that all night have downloaded Tar@@ ball , translate and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you are using it , check first whether the speech disp@@ at@@ cher works with your speech syn@@ thesizer correctly . for this purpose , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ scription SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed so well that the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed directly , and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text will be dismant@@ led into individual sentences . the user can go back , repeat or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; if you have an application text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you want to use a speaker , whose language is English and whose sex is female , otherwise it will be automatically the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; gt ; a speaker is selected , you see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the box speaker on Add @-@ click , and to edit a speaker at the list or click on Edit , the card reader section will be shown . for example , in the following the setup of the module for Festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found under . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only need to enter into festival . &quot;
&quot; select the encoding for text to be handed over to Festival . by voices , the &amp; frac@@ ts ; well known , this attitude will be performed automatically . in general , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 to use Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak according to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , adjust volume , microphone speed and pitch @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a number of controllers , you cannot select this grey voice from you chosen voice . &quot;
&quot; several voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet been set up a speaker ( or forget to click on users ) . &quot;
&quot; this check box is marked , is visible when starting from kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window is visible , but not the program window is visible , but not the program window . Click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is marked and dict@@ ated , it appears in the system area , once K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . thereby , you can access the opportunity to stop or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders in qu@@ eue , along with the application which has adjusted the contract , the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the just processed proposition . speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can get a full post in the order that is selected in the list below , before or return . ( but not each order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with one click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here are only text entries are listed and administ@@ rated . issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern , War@@ nings and News will not appear . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it was compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audio module , can &apos;t load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ co@@ de should be used for audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . select AL@@ SA , select the PCM device here . see also &quot;
&quot; set the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % of the double normal speaking speed . thus , the program SO@@ X must be installed . &quot;
Click on users to adopt the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA tools includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device is working with you . in doubt , select Standard . &quot;
&quot; on this card card , you can set special actions that will always be executed if the text contract is interrupted with a higher priority . &amp; gt ; processes four types of voice orders : &quot;
&quot; the Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern Edition has the highest priority . it will be drawn up to all other orders and will hold these orders . after the output of the Screen Reader was pre @-@ read , the orders received will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority priority . this stage is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is used to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless somebody is welcome to enter the room straight . &quot;
&quot; a text contract is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the qu@@ eue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played , if a normal text contract is interrupted . if both single @-@ conduc@@ tive sound will be active as well , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card card are only valid for normal text orders . for news , war@@ nings and the issues of Screen Re@@ a@@ ars there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
to read &amp; t ; K@@ emer@@ al messages read and click on noti@@ fications . noti@@ fications noti@@ fications seems to be noti@@ fied .
&quot; mark this check box to switch the read of &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ alert can &apos;t be selected , the other settings are disabled and noti@@ fications ; do not read any noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , noti@@ fications , with which a sound is played , by &amp; c@@ ert ; not read . &quot;
&quot; to add these buttons to add events to the list , or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog box appears in which you want to add the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
this event reads the message that &amp; conversation ; sent when someone has mentioned your nickname in an IR@@ C message .
&quot; all events , which in the list is nothing else specified , will be ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; use this selection field , to determine what &amp; c@@ table ; to do if an event takes place . you have the following selection options : &quot;
&quot; if you are reading the user defined text , enter the required text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaking speaker . standard elec@@ ts the speaker that will be displayed in the list on card speaker as the top entry . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if a particular event is specified for a particular application . otherwise , the promotion is executed for all other events of the specific application . otherwise , the action will be set to carry down below Standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
&quot; the event all noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list . for this , you can define the pre @-@ appro@@ vals assign@@ ments as follows : &quot;
&quot; to save the messages in a file , use the button store to download the stored settings from a file . if you want to start the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click the delete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a voice output . this standard includes brands for the control of voices , the voice volume , the volume of the voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently it supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) because this is the standard voice that is used in the SS@@ ML issue .
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch is set at the festival configuration dialog not on 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous spoken . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; 1.0 &quot; / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis ? asked my father . who has slept in my bed ? asked the bear ind . &#93; &#93; &gt;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds must also be syn@@ thes@@ ized in single sentences , not the first set to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text contract . thus , you can also return to the card orders a full @-@ time or jump or stop , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers do not support them directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops , you will automatically add a pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition of the filter . you can change its settings or modify further set @-@ to @-@ proof filters , but beginners will be completed . &quot;
&quot; easiest to read the speaker selection process by selecting and enter text for reading . if you select the speaker selection , check out some properties and check out how the speaker selection has changed . furthermore , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; then you can start with the pre @-@ reading , as only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long &quot;
&quot; you can then take text orders to hold your card orders , or cancel , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers cannot support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal Sat@@ z@@ bound@@ ar filter will be set automatically when you &apos;re starting at the first time . it cannot be switched off , unless you are removed . don &apos;t change anything about this filter , unless you do what you do . &quot;
&quot; compare text with a regular expression of sat@@ in and add a tab@@ ular sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the set limits ( dec@@ imal characters are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard proposition sign filter keeps the composition . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never used on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News ( k@@ gs ) , war@@ nings , news or the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal Sat@@ z@@ bound@@ ar filter , you can insert this again by loading the into &amp; kt@@ ts ; contained in the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; on the card menu , you can write the speaker settings for application . the card is displayed if &quot;
use of the standard speakers ( the top on the card card ) . in other words : no speech properties are specified .
&quot; use of the matching speaker , which shows all the properties of an equipped speaker . if you don &apos;t delete the settings of the speaking or edit , choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , the most originally set @-@ set properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker characteristics by clicking on one of the buttons button .
&quot; here , select the properties of the desired microphone . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , enter nothing . &quot;
&quot; mark this check box , if the property has to have before other features . you can also set multiple markings here . &quot;
&quot; as the language is a critical factor in the output of the output , it is always rare to use this feature . the only case if you might want to specify the attribute language , if you might know that a specific application text is sent in another language as the result of the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the properties in the speaker , use on the next to the following , click on the selection button default , and then use speaker , which is equivalent to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is set for the final text in the qu@@ eue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is required 0 required ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr crash@@ es immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get tra@@ ce@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is shut down and pulled down . probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ amb@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I hold a text contract , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message that says : &quot; to open PCM . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem exists that conflicts at AL@@ SA will prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices . information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ t@@ t@@ .org . &quot;
I have invited an additional voice for Festival from the internet . I installed it and can &apos;t use them in festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / c@@ lich@@ d / Vo@@ ices the new voice is added . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to developers . &quot;
&quot; on the card audio there is a setting speed . thus it works , the program SO@@ X installed and over the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H can also be able to provide a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the microphone speed are ignored when &amp; gt ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is what the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML ) . SS@@ ML has its own tags , with which the speed is converted . ( see ) or if you are very cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ sync file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to SS@@ ML conver@@ sions , and set up the microphone speed . &quot;
I don &apos;t create that websites can be read with a female voice . I set up a female festival speaker but &amp; gt ; reads the websites with a male voice .
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not work . this festival doesn &apos;t produce an error , the X@@ SL file leads to converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same goes for VO@@ ICE tags too . &quot;
I have added a string ch@@ ained filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more sat@@ in advance or return . on board orders are displayed only out of one proposition only . what am I doing wrong ?
&quot; inter@@ section characters ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comp@@ ma and semi @-@ ik@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out for this character instead of a filter to set detection . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; sound architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ t@@ t@@ .org )
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . note : make sure that the modules are registered for G@@ amb@@ itions by calling the G@@ ST register before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org ) &quot;
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts at the audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t listen to music and start a text , and then you can start a text for this problem at the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you stop a text in &amp; kt@@ ops , the current set is still read . &quot;
&quot; the audio program SO@@ X uses the general setting of the microphone speed , but otherwise it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ X with the command apt @-@ get install SO@@ X . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; have you &amp; kt@@ ts ; downloaded as a tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ grab@@ bed archive ) , sign up as normal users and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball in a proper folder . change in this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
&quot; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4 , the module &amp; arts is removed ; probably removed or at least still on request . &quot;
&quot; the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a maturity of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the direc@@ tives of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) . the column configure option indicates the switch parameter , which causes the transfer of creating . &quot;
&quot; as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 , this file is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you need to specify as option --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . &quot;

&quot; before you are using , check first if your voice syn@@ thesizer is correct . follow the instructions you have received with Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . in many voices you can adjust volume , microphone speed and pitch . &quot;
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions provided with the festival . you would like to read the websites you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to limitations with the transfer . &quot;
&quot; this voice is set at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in early development stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / Vo@@ ices / russian / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to comp@@ ile a C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; district distri@@ butions . look for the first time on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the directive must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to a 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer . then the le@@ x@@ ik@@ al analysis and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; creates it from the audio output . the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; program and m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; generates language of di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival creates this by &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; needed Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create from German text di@@ phone . more information is available .
&quot; for this procedure , additional wra@@ ppers will be added to Festival to use &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; file extension does not be installed , but in the file / li@@ b / . instructions can be found under &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; voices . it is required either Festival 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install Festival and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; then invite MS German festival &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package that you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , the entry of error correction isn &apos;t necessary , you only need to re@@ comp@@ ile the festival ) . then add the following lines into the file / li@@ b / sit@@ ut@@ it@@ .@@ s@@ cm . &quot;

&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ il@@ lo@@ ff speech syn@@ thesizer , which is written in &amp; Java ; you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can adjust neither pitch , volume nor voice speed . &quot;
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language syn@@ thesizer that can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line .
&quot; best use a command to send the speech output into a temporary audio file ( wav ) , instead of sending the output directly to audio equipment . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; co@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that enables the management of network interfaces , of the rout@@ ings and the DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of systems and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . it can be accessed by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; co@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the network network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting a contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; box . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have already been installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is possible to display and setting the network properties . &quot;
&quot; most of the cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed with install and installed . network devices will be added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjust@@ ing the following files according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network interface settings will be loaded , if the network settings are selected at the &amp; inter@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network , it is trying to detect the platform on the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the h@@ amm@@ ate selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and release of release . by marking the adjustment of no @-@ again , this selection can then be pre@@ set automatically . &quot;
&quot; the change of network settings are possible only in the system management mode . previously , all options are gray , which means that modify the settings can only be viewed , changing system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is the input of password required . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders : &quot;
the tab network interfaces for the management of the system &apos;s network . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed :
the settings of the network interface can be set by selecting the required device in the list and click the button on the button . set up in the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . Click the button of the Advanced Settings menu shows the dialog with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of Autom@@ atically , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings will be required for the system with the launch of system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server will be required . in the selection list may either be selected either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system . &quot;
&quot; using the manual , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP address can be made . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , initi@@ alized the system interface to the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values set in this dialog are displayed as features of the device in the device box .
it should be ensured that the IP address would not be used in the network . using a already existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can notice if the desired address should be asked in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; network devices can be switched on , if necessary , or switched off . switch on an extended network device is done by selecting from the list and click the interface .... &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , if necessary , switch off a activated network device via selection from the list and click the interface .... &quot;
&quot; the IP address of the host is set to remote networks in the local sub@@ net , which allows the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with host computers in other sub@@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if your computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network , where the Gateway Computer is selected . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces the corresponding IP address by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers only can understand IP address . if computers are htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ solves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the Reit@@ er@@ pillar solution enables simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified .@@ DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a paper and round , or rec@@ l@@ assi@@ fication in the list with buttons . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name solution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialog New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then add the button adding . the entry is then added in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group box on the name resolution , select one entry and then click on the button .... It will display the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; the list of nam@@ eable computers describes host @-@ to @-@ IP address references to the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by boats , if no DNS servers will be available . in small , enclosed networks may replace it &apos;s DNS servers . &quot;
normally the list contains nam@@ ally known calcul@@ ator some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses . this is still the existing version of IP to replace in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host and click on Add .... The dialog New alias will be added .
&quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known host and add the button adding . if the known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , add the button adding several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a well @-@ known host from the list and select Edit .... The dialog box will edit the machine .
&quot; one of the following tasks can be implemented , then updated with clicking OK , updated the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net to download the latest version of the source texts .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; K@@ DE are installed and Q@@ t installed .
&quot; the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply downloading the rpm package , and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows : &quot;
&quot; alternatively , a tool with graphic surface like k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE are sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development committee with libraries and others are required . &quot;
&quot; this is not recommended to use users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile these commands . &quot;
&quot; in the first paragraph of this chapter , important information on basic network technology will be given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files are discussed . &quot;
this area can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x are only basic information on the integration of PCs into a small ( home @-@ ) network .
&quot; currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IPv4 ) . in addition , there are never large spread . from IPv6 , it is expected to pass through the near future . therefore , this description focuses on the widespread IPv4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge to as@@ sign an IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on the &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator to provide a valid IP address , if available , the IP address cannot be selected . &quot;
&quot; when setting up a own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address checks with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet . therefore , its use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be facil@@ itated by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , most addresses are generally used in the 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all the hosts are participants in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own host ) . the standard route is required for the IP res@@ etting . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in your own machine . usually , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes changed in DSL connections , so that it is not surprised if in the case of active DSL connections a different content can be found there . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand can be expected as expected .

&quot; and the dat ; is a safety program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the opportunity to create multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar , which provided my wife : how much longer does it take if you sec@@ ures ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; that can happen on three types : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Bu@@ yer , sp@@ as the band back and reads the pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ing information of the tape . recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; if you don &apos;t know if the band will be form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the Pre@@ sp@@ ell , searches after the appropriate index on your disk . cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be created ane@@ w . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol changes to the tape drive , to indicate that the band was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched for the band . &quot;
&quot; before entering the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this : &quot;
&quot; if there is a change of the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the band has been resolved and will show an appropriate message in the status bar . the band can now be cast out without any danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be used , it needs to be form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; a band types must form@@ at@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not conform to form@@ att@@ ing data . if your tape drives , it must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can form@@ at@@ ted the tape off by the band . Flo@@ ppy Band@@ width can usually be form@@ at@@ ted , by contrast , DA@@ T drives cannot be form@@ ulated . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the tape . all data on the tape are lost , the volume is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you must select the secured files . this can be done on three types : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file @-@ tree . only this file or file is secured .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
mark files in local file @-@ tree with one block . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are secured .
&quot; right click on the local file @-@ tree , and select the ... &quot;
&quot; once the backup was introduced , dialogue settings will open to backup . in this dialogue you can check out the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings , the dialog appears to backup . dialogue shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
mark a file or folder in one of the archives in the record for the drive . only the selected file or folders is checked .
mark the files in one of the archives in the record for the band with one block . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are checked .
Click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
&quot; once the test process started , the dialog settings will appear for verification . in this dialogue you can check out your selection and change the working file for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog appears to check out the process of testing and data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can restart the recovery , the files you need to be restored must be marked . this can be done on two types : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drives . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
mark the desired files from one of the archives with one block . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are restored .
&quot; with the right mouse button , click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the menu . &quot;
&quot; once the recovery process started , the dialogue settings will appear for recovery . in this dialogue you can check out your selection and change the working file for rest@@ oring . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings for recovery , dialogue re@@ produce . this dialogue shows the progress of recovery and data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to create the tape @-@ inde@@ x@@ file using the belt content . this process does all existing index files for this band . they can create the index on two types from the band :
&quot; this is used by a safety profile with the just selected files and default settings , and you can make the following settings for ensuring that safety profile : &quot;
&quot; the current working file , in which the backup is to be made . the list of secured files is automatically updated accordingly to the chosen working file . &quot;
&quot; for all folders that are listed under backup files , that only the files are stored on the same file system , like the folder . folders that are stored on other file systems , you can enter separately under backup files . each entry is viewed from tar independently from the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last in@@ cre@@ mation Backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files have changed since then . &quot;
&quot; the name of the file , which is used to set changes since the last non @-@ incre@@ mental backup . &quot;
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings using the menu option K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the settings :
the full path to the device file for tape drives ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ real version of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; c@@ dat ; before the band is integrated , the command will load load to the drive . when some drives is necessary , this is necessary to read or write operations . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched ON , it tries to lock on the throw at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , the insert of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically complet@@ es the tape automatically . don &apos;t use this option on Flo@@ ppy Stream@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched ON , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware size for tape drives . not all drives support variable recor@@ ders . no matter whether this attitude is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band running . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band format , it has a file at the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove a storage block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host : seconds , with the name of the full name of the system , on which the band has been form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds since the era has been form@@ at@@ ted in which the band has been form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / file .
&quot; the remaining files on the band are pure tar - archives that can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work , as long as it does not apply to cre@@ ams . &quot;
check the content of a backup . this symbol is only active when a band is integrated .
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewers for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , where you can get information about your system , or where the system makes the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users can experience the fast access to information about problems that appear on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files . the program is appropriate for in@@ experienced users , which can not know where you can obtain information about your system , or where the system supports the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log enables quick access to information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore try to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and analysed with the help of the protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful features . these include : &quot;
support for many different types of protocols files for the Sy@@ slo@@ g server format and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this hand@@ book .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen photo , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions are provided with the help of the single protocol rows of a protocol @-@ file easily fil@@ ming and sort . the individual options for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual page . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; initially the main protocol @-@ file of the system - to open . will you do this not display , and it will be run under Linux usually in folder / var / log , for the normal users usually do not have permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or to filter strings . in the default setting , the list of log@@ ging lines will now be displayed automatically , so that only protocol lines will be displayed next to the selected filters . then a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns that contain the string tab . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also select another entry in this place . select the string search concept only with entries in the selected column . choose the name of a process that shows you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines which were sent or posted by this process . &quot;
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you identify the important protocol lines . protocol rows of Level errors are displayed with a consp@@ ic@@ uous color as a protocol @-@ lines of the level note . the coloured representation of protocol lines can be switched off .
&quot; if you want to display certain process ( for example in the protocol protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can be useful to examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process process . for example , if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all the new coming protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows viewing several protocol files to separate sub@@ sid@@ y . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open up additional sub @-@ windows and manage . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display . &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website to htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ Forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more recent information about the source of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; also in the following folder of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion archive : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Archives
&quot; welcome to the &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it rapidly develops into the standard for control of the program starts in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD index . &quot;
I will not go further on historical aspects ( including because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it @-@ binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone could try to introduce a machine to system V In@@ it , without creating a re@@ installing and new format . therefore , you need to ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was a one . &quot;
&quot; the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc , instead of directly in / etc . this folder is r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service which you want to start at the start of the system or when changing to another run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services include such things as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls may belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
r@@ c.@@ local should lie in turn under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there &apos;s not much use for this . you can also use r@@ c.@@ r@@ in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection . &quot;
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the standard run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see in the initial area as the following :
&quot; at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre @-@ set Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can repair / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . if you &apos;re going to manually repair the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start to enter all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
how do and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is so written that it &apos;s an argument like start and stop . you can actually start the scripts out of hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would pause the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains , the script will stop with the argument . if it includes an S , the script will be called by the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; an server @-@ lap , that can run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . , I could also have a user @-@ lap , the &amp; D ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was used as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; c@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to say not tri@@ vial : draw an entry from the availability of availability system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can change scripts in between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within one level by removing it somewhere else . this will not only happen if they will pull out an entry from the availability of availability .
&quot; note : entries are post@@ pon@@ ed if you select this in a new range . to select it only to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select copy from the menu , and even if the same entry already exists in the target range of action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ rows of a entry cannot be calculated sometimes . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present there is no possibility to restore entries , which have been thrown into the paper basket . so , be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator key to activate the different working areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection or below the previous meeting . &quot;
&quot; to post@@ p@@ one entry into another run@@ level , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change sorting order or the name of a entry manually , press the button button to switch the properties dialog . use the tab@@ ulator button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre@@ ferences are used by the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they are saved by &amp; c@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I &apos;ve got experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts resistant . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the li@@ lo pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single , and press the input button to start in a single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be fine ) . &quot;
&quot; I provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended for running under Run@@ level X , but they will not be executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you have to edit additional files in / etc that are available in these distri@@ butions . please read details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the species , such as system services in these distri@@ butions , does not simpli@@ fy the configuration for proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and even if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache , or htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply without any message if their configuration files are not present or false . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ running varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send us information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added . &quot;
&quot; this documentation refers to &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program , you can manage the users and groups of your system . &quot;
&quot; to start with &amp; user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; user . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you have to save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or record stores in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; &amp; user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and user @-@ related list . to edit the desired users or the desired group with double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group characteristics . &quot;
&quot; some flash@@ cards are only represented if you have advanced system settings . only if you have advanced system settings . only if you have access to custom settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , if you are able to make individual settings , if shadow passwords , etc / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d may be installed as in BSD languages . &quot;
&quot; the card password management appears , if shadow passwords , or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD colors are installed . &quot;
&quot; this card card only appears , if for at least a built @-@ in file system limited ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here can be changed for any user parameters , whereby the limit constra@@ ints can be changed in KB . &quot;
&quot; these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the field fil@@ esystem , with limited limitation . &quot;
&quot; card groups inform@@ s about the group settings of the selected user . the standard group , which the user belongs , will find in the primitive group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by using this in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select from the menu user or group or click on the right button button of the tool bar . edit or delete the selected user or the selected group works analog . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can add the li@@ lo boot manager , remove the boat password , remove and change the time to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change , change , and more . &quot;
