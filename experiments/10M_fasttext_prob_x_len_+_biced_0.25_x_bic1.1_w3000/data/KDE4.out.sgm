<seg id="479">& digiarrived; introduces three different tool to sharpening. each of you have advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool to sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but creates particularly in dark areas, grain images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"unshareholding mask is working on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it does not use psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric darkness and it's a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"Refocus is probably the best of the three, as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its use and has various parameters for adjusting."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized pictures need a correction of the sharpness. this is the same phenomenon to be combined with only minimal differences. the same phenomenon is to be printed into a common color. SLR cameras will usually need more and later than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at JPEG image, a camera of internal sharpening has been applied frequently. in contrast, pictures in the raw format must always be weakened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner will take advantage of raising the picture during installation of the image. if you disable this, check the control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with sharpening poeering. you can claim your input with the menu entry."</seg>
<seg id="487">"but you should be careful to deal with careful because the results are not very natural: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplify the noise. in general, you can find it on the menu entry Control Refocus. in general, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too tight. the solution to draw the picture a little soft, is much simpler than it. use the tool for a softmark with the menu entry Korrigize soft and experiment with settings. the presentation of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masked is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and preview can help you edit the image. the printed window shows the output of the film with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values generate very good results and should first be tried out. an increase of the radius or amount reinforce the effect. if you create the unsharks mask to strongly make noise and impression of grass near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is like many pixels on each side of a edge through the filters. high resolution images allow larger radians. they should therefore sharpens pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wired picture, which is added to the original. thereby, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a split from the maximum RGB-value and the difference amount. you can define a minimum difference for a edge of the filters. in this way, areas with a soft switch between the tones of sharpening and therefore beauty errors are avoided in faces, heavens and water surface areas."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed picture the (2). insharp masked has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiarrived; tool Refocus is focused on a picture through improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries a picture to & quot; refocsierenquot; it is a better approach to sharpening the photo. it is a better way to sharpening the photo. it is using a technology called FIR Viennese filtering. it is using a technology called FIR Wiener Filing. it is using a technology called FIR Wiener Filing. you can start the menu by using colors refocus in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular torch is much better than the Gauß's Foot. the Gauß's Fill has a very long tail, which leads far from the source pixies that are far away from the original queting pixel. the FIR Vienna Inverse is influenced by far away from distant pixels. this causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular ness: this is the radius of the circular line. it is the most important parameters for the use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should be 1 good results. however, you can make a higher value if your picture should be very unsharp then on Heiligenscha."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce arsenic. the correlation can be reduced from 0-1. useful values are equal to 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduced the sharpening effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in the sound filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values can be reduced by 0-1. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will still fail."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. if you want to avoid this parameter, if you want to avoid an unequal filter. in most cases, you should avoid this value to 0 if you may also increase the correlation coefficient and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformer size. an increase in matrix size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular ness or the pallet's sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"the stores as well as loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refocus parameters that you have set, will be saved for later and then can be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try out all the cutting, colour and intensity corrections to the image before you use the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read pictures and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp masked produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by unsharp masked a larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it has to produce unsharp masked always artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of unsharpen. for the Viennese filter is always at least as good as the unsharpen mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused picture, see:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear colour image has to be corrected. this image has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to unsufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for further information about the methods for sharpenal correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">"the regulators of the deposit uses the unshareholding of the area, to create a more natural poupation."</seg>
<seg id="514">"the color tinte allows a customized colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image incorrect is one of the most advanced tools to remove undesired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Insert algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different preferences than Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the default settings are below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the horsemen and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail balance, p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a smaller value leads to a smooth glass of smooth and details. a value of 0,9 should be easily obtained. please note that no sharpening should be subordinated permanently. please note that the details should always be subordinated."</seg>
<seg id="520">"direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly into all directions, while a value close to 1 only can be smoothed in one direction. JPEG Artefacts will be best removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of smoke in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"rule of regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more is being exposed, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulent effect, it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: is there how often the algorithm is going through. usually 1 or 2 are usually sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"Anisotropic Alpha [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected, it should also be small. make sure that small angles need a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and for your needs acceptable."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral steppes in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel bulbs and never exceed 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation Use: the more to quality you get through selection of this option is only low. but he doubled the term. therefore we recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons save as and store make exactly this. every setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="528">"image error is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can last very long and take a high CPU load. therefore, you can break the calculation at any time with the button demolition."</seg>
<seg id="529">"below, you can see like image errors with small artifacts. the module is shown on a photo that caused by an analog camera in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the trip. the original image is below (1) and the correct image is below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digifted; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange. it uses a copyright algorithm by Peter rear.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filter, to remove stains and other artifacts e.g. from dust or hair on the lens, remove. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moirev; effects from scanned pictures from books or magazines."</seg>

<seg id="534">"in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain in default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is needed for the filter. large values increase the time of the filter per pixel. the image can be spoiled by the radius, and the colour in it is smoothed and therefore smaller bugs."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the depth of the filter. this value sets the pixel pitch of the filter to the front. if it is increased, caterships will be deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can't get more and noise again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the fillet. if it is too strong can not be removed or catchers can occur. if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">"density: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve the image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings."</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you either color or luminance to enhance a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the effatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of darker areas, which typically tend to increase stronger. however, it also raises the shadow segments."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls the alignment of phasenmesh damping. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges may appear. if it is too high, noise and phasenjitter can appear at the edges. it can remove noise and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">"store under and loading: these buttons are used precisely for this. all parameters for space reduction that you have set, can be stored in the file system and then recharged."</seg>
<seg id="543">"this is an example of how noise reduction can change your lives. the original image is marked with (1), and the measured value was marked with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="544">"sometimes a picture is crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft, is fortunately much easier than a picture. use the tool for a softmark with the menu entry Korrigize soft and experiment with the glassle. the front look at the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiarrived; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photospecies file.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adjusted to dive into digital, original or retrospectively digitised pictures to remove film architectures, scratches, compression charts and local errors that makes the content as it also makes the human eye."</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colouring and texturing. the texturing is developed using a different tool that was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / Frannya and is part of the CImg project.</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events in events which the synthesizer understands."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI-map that converts all events of Change patch to Bright Piano in the events of Change patch to Trumpet and thus making a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you have only a sound card, you don't need MIDI-map because all sound cards GM are compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices, and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there is no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite ditor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required conversions for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which is how many times it may appear as desired. however, that every occurrence has a different text ID (see below)."</seg>

<seg id="1661">"in this section, the patches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard. the general use is as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equation are ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), so you can't change the order thus and do not allow the line for one of 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds that need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard has no tissues (e.g. with sound 60), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a tissue. in addition, wear the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so now, if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (rifle shooting), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here is meant by the term drum patch of the patch included, in which each tone is a different percussioner instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one, at which the tone is the pitch of the always same drum (such as some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section will be used to specify the sounds on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as in the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keyboards for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to make sounds on the perkite channel. look as an example the supplied keyboards.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to form some channels on other, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, simply make it simply in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"this channel is the channel that is displayed on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, you'll need to use the keymap option for this channel. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored when using the ForcePatch option, will always be ignored the patch on this channel. in this case, patch is always used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to use the perkite patch on the perkite channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBender's ratio is multiplied, in which ratio of Pitch-Bender events is multiplied and then forwarded to the value n * (r / 4096), it will be redirected by the formula n * (r / 4096), so that the value of 4096 is used in the map file (no decimal number)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM provides a keyboard, which is to play an pitch of a pitch of 4096, to play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards to play two sounds up to a octave. unfortunately, you need to try a bit with & kmid; try to try a bit with & kmid; try to try a bit."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI-map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. these can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">"the sealview is a window with a whole range of piano pieces (one for each MIDI channel). on these pieces, you'll see which sounds are just played."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose a instrument, the button doesn't lights any more green, but red, to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>

<seg id="1681">"the Tempo LCD displays the speed, which is played with a song. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. if you can find a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. thus, the same MIDI file may lead to very different results, just like two different musicians the same notes can play in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can't force anyone, & kmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the formatting language that you like best. therefore this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation-tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; Repository if someone has done this for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. we need to let the docrc file to you here.</seg>

<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation: "</seg>

<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents are referenced directly to a file (and consistent at the upper end of the building view & mdash; folders will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but pay attention & and lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; tags files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"the contents section is the range of the docrc file, which is to be displayed in writing of the textsensitive help. for example, if when writing a & PHP; scripts the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function would appear directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file binding lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of confusing separate context-elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">"now, you can simply save your file docrc as well as $HOME / .kde / doc / apps / quanta / doc / apps / quanta / doc / apps / quanta / doc / apps / quanta / doc / apps for local or global use. then you create a folder (like docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copying your HTML documentation."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are sure that these good and value are worth to be shared, send your docrc files using a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were not rich in the & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich, but proud of being in the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the separating resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>

<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you will be asked to ask for their private GPG key (the Passphrase will not be saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys you can read out. in the dialog New resource, the input fields can be empty (URL preview can be left empty) and when clicking OK."</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can also upload the DTD DTD-Package (DTEP) to upload toolbar toolbar and started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree.</seg>

<seg id="2959">"the init-binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone could try to introduce a machine to system V Init, without creating a reinstalling and new format. therefore, you need to ensure that the old Init was removed from there if there was a one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SYSV Init differs from the BSD Init, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc, instead of directly in / etc. this folder is rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service which you want to start at the start of the system or when changing to another runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services include such things as setserial, which is only once started. such calls may belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie in turn under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there's not much use for this. you can also use rc.rin / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial connection. "</seg>

<seg id="2965">"at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre-set Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can repair / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you're going to manually repair the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start to enter all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">How do and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is so written that it's an argument like start and stop. you can actually start the scripts out of hand on the command line as follows:</seg>

<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was used as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & csysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to say not trivial: draw an entry from the availability of availability system services to one of the six runlevel to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can change scripts in between Runleveln or change the position within one level by removing it somewhere else. this will not only happen if they will pull out an entry from the availability of availability.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are postponed if you select this in a new range. to select it only to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select copy from the menu, and even if the same entry already exists in the target range of action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorrows of a entry cannot be calculated sometimes. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present there is no possibility to restore entries, which have been thrown into the paper basket. so, be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator key to activate the different working areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection or below the previous meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to postpone entry into another runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change sorting order or the name of a entry manually, press the button button to switch the properties dialog. use the tabulator button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are used by the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise they are saved by & csysv; changes to default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>

<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you have to edit additional files in / etc that are available in these distributions. please read details in the distribution manual."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the species, such as system services in these distributions, does not simplify the configuration for proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but is unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are present, which are required by the respective system service (and even if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache, or httpd) are simply without any message if their configuration files are not present or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -running varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send us information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added."</seg>
