&quot; although I had visited the USA for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extremely great .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I had d@@ anced for American music , read American writers and worked for its sports . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a profound profound effect on me that I was mainly due to a American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less journalist who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of a oil @-@ Magn@@ um , who wanted to be incl@@ ined to his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after Method Man , &quot; I was like that the absolute truth is , forget everything else I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only been strengthened . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people . &quot;
I even had a very narrow love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
&quot; the most exceptional aspect of his ascension is for me , as he walk@@ eth with his narrow @-@ minded . &quot;
he never stops behind the mountain as you say so nicely .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague it express , and explains openly his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ american and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won with Republican Presi@@ dential elections , was the highest number ever reached by the party &apos;s nominated candidate . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person ?
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people in order that I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme that people from around the world takes a deep gl@@ ancing man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps World illustr@@ ative does not agree with the editor of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ us &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for their life long , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with patience and grace , and helped my colleagues to acc@@ use us to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me much with my career . &quot;
these people and those by they em@@ bodies my love in America .
&quot; while dro@@ pping his way to the nominated Republican Presi@@ dential candidate , she gave me a stop and the counter@@ part to its limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or maybe just because of its contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ frontation with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump , because they were either convicted of rac@@ ism and fan@@ at@@ ism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
maybe it is un@@ fair the tr@@ ump elec@@ torate as ro@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; arrange men , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and respec@@ t@@ less , indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who take action on another way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities cannot be taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of whom most knows are , for tr@@ ump , because they want to gain control over a country that she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps . maybe .
&quot; however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks with contemp@@ t upon those who look different . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( chap@@ m . ) : as much as &quot; Re@@ jection of the White against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities &quot; ; word play of white in play on the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means that great Van Jones had just killed what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have , America is every welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country has chosen as his pre@@ sidents , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with the choice Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise and says : hell with vers@@ eness , freedom of religion and all the term of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America , after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruin , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all this I have to think of k@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; at a rally for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have been my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot;
&quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; No ! &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; I ro@@ ared the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried out , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone like you , who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and powerful &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan joined the words : &quot; God is thanks to Mr. Tr@@ ump is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
&quot; the country , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; now Tr@@ um@@ ps country , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could no place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart breaks .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
&quot; the music that is played on both places , not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the outskirts of a large land@@ fill , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular with tourists , but worlds apart from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years , the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has now been playing in the municipality : one out of children and adults , existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which with their musical instruments has an opportunity to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os is known for their drugs and mis@@ use violence .
but this changed after an accid@@ ental encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth had always offered a rare hop@@ el@@ essness .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously ( local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI ) :
&quot; once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; always come laugh@@ ing and with shining eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , horn horn , ti@@ mp@@ ani , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from tr@@ ash
&quot; more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that lies practically on the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital , based on instruments which are recovered from recovered waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re @-@ prepared instruments which consist of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the recycled ke@@ er under management of Fa@@ vio Chávez began to transform parts of the query into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate violin , viola , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets and drums that were produced from rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , remembers the initial season : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place the children had no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something that he had never seen before : made up of rub@@ b@@ ish .
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from re @-@ prepared material and called the Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tonnes of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and of him are the arms - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectac@@ le of rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing fights .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that targeted specifically on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental issues . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ publication occurs in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices , together with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia , before reaching the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were applied accordingly , and little incl@@ ined , a bill of legislation to be welcome to its coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the tum@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they refused to share one of their har@@ bors , and refused to share a fishing licence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; remembers Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . it is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and persecuted . &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it didn &apos;t manage to catch fish there .
&quot; ultimately it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Fishing Fishing ( stop Il@@ legal F@@ isheries ) . &quot;
&quot; apart from Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are driven out of their waters by Somalia and Madagascar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; thus , we have eight countries that are is@@ ans and work together . they share information and stand each other in where to be illegal fishing , says Tony Long , Head of Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden , absent because it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the intenti@@ onal breach of existing laws , through which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can harm that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing once caused by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the snow @-@ emp@@ iri@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions will happen in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; the individual countries , for example , can exchange lists of existing licenses , news for susp@@ icious activity or details that one not@@ ices or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursued the activities of ships also very attentive , if they move on the open lake , via satellite data . &quot;
&quot; it enables the authorities to mark ships to mark ships that are protected in banned areas , such as susp@@ icious driving routes , such as susp@@ ects that a ship carries its caught fish on other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ideal case , such studies show whether the involved ships have a fishing license , where they were on the way and possibly , whether they have a criminal complaint . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing may be based on the basis of this information , which means that the ships could not sell their cargo . and that even for the numbers of pen@@ alties , such as the Premier . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial losses for the owners , meaning that illegal fishing is not worthwhile anymore . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a Ber@@ ners who supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to win over 20 million USD in lost sales , which will lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year due to the Il@@ legal fisher@@ man who penet@@ rate the Eastern African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has put one of the most productive tuna fishing industry , which attracts the area of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also the same illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , counter@@ feit license documents , indication of ph@@ asi@@ en@@ ames , the fishing protected species and fish in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you use the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ mosquito control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; there could be a ship illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could say &apos; You must not walk my port . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal conclusion is trying to close to F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; so far , the finished front works . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships . &quot;
there has been crimin@@ als uncovered who used counter@@ feit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found wing@@ ed ships .
&quot; due to his collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i information can share information on illegal fishing via large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations show us pretty much in the networks of organised crime &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system that aims to help F@@ ISH , susp@@ icious vessels of precise vessels . &quot;

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed , helps to track the illegal ships to hide themselves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the Il@@ legal Fischer use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , Chef analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a N@@ RO that also deals with f@@ isheries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; for example , some of the ships can turn off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be used by satellite . &quot;
&quot; this is why Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines different information of information . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to help criminal act with larger precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team really influence influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oce@@ ana the platform Global Fishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of each tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of it , who is doing where - this makes simple sense , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources on the investigation . &quot;
we should do this at global level . &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run on which a global system permits the persecution of ships .
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crimin@@ als , but they also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships which previously conf@@ ection@@ ate and hardly have to count with consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i countries have a 33 % increase in f@@ isheries sales since then fishing boats more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped with Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors took place on the to@@ wing to@@ e , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , we will disappear several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there are six countries together in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they now also fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; with safety it is the goal of making even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s recently managed to report its first major triumph in Somalia : in October there was a ship sailing under false flag . and not only the ship was travelling without a license and were used for to@@ wing networks , which are now banned . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also located in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they were a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof of such a special , collabor@@ ative work mode to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world .

&quot; her article will appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ED Education , New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is spread further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of conqu@@ ering the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of heavy demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government had rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans re@@ acted in their eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country , in which they were gathered together on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return flight of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments against them .
&quot; the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ lands of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located in the central North of the Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o village and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ as@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , making it noticeable in everyday life of the vene@@ er by a acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw in the counter@@ f@@ ences of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , the chance for a fundamental change ; ultimately , the accounting for a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the government in its latest article : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ( the rate of inflation and medicine ) , the referendum for many as the only way to return to the country to rec@@ ap@@ point its institutional structures and to make a new government &apos;s alliance . &quot;

the call on Twitter is commented on Twitter as follows :

&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Program &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the march , which are published in real time , testify to an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disp@@ utes with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most common images shows a demonstr@@ ators , who calls through the patron signs : &quot; will you kill me , because I have hungry ? &quot;

especially big waves struck the news about police repression in central North @-@ located town Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves according to its own statement before the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces including this woman in the An@@ des state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira have no skirts because you could see anything else which could not have many nation@@ alization !
&quot; meanwhile , an Inf@@ ographic has already taken the round that forms the extent of oppression each day : &quot;
so the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial procedure - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fake .
here is your counter@@ f@@ ences !

&quot; others have taken this protests as a further step in the fight against a government , taken from their perspective little against the dis@@ astro@@ us economic crisis and thus rather busy to leave critical voices : &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more about frequency and intensity .

&quot; this is a adap@@ ted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , who was already published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Cordoba . &quot;
&quot; now , as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano , now in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in Córdoba , spoke against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the process that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined who were committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano is not looking for his life .
&quot; beginning with the burden , the same name as his father went to bear the brutal military bases in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , has suffered enough . &quot;
he held the family secret for 34 years .
&quot; in the situation then , I believed that this was fine . &quot;
I felt like an obe@@ dient .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , they do not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not recognize that my father was a thief , fol@@ lower and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ chan@@ ter . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was from 1976 to 1978 , deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
archive recording .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppressed , because of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 year child is charged . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who had witnessed the extent of atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Tribunal for his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows , which great power has a parent over his child , and how this child chose a way of redemption . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to participate in the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had been friends with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts . &quot;
they called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I told my father from him and a few days later , he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend . &quot;
he said :
&quot; you are an ass@@ hole , you have friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; be sure that they will not lead you one day , and I must save you . &quot;
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo - the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party .
&quot; therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the sports hall . some days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would become obe@@ dient . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because so my father had caught me .
&quot; on the military base , I had to anni@@ hil@@ ate papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : University connections , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simple everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ as the prisoners are tortured &apos; .
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
&quot; as he joined the second time he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ gain , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little in a ceiling wrapped and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the stolen objects were shut down , and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he interpreted an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I saw in , and saw a lying , tortured on men . &quot;
she looked like a field@@ bed and metal springs .
&quot; later I found out that she was attached to an end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body &apos;s body , which was straight there . &quot;
&quot; they f@@ lowed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , shot him with water , and pursued a charge of 220 volts in the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the rock there was horri@@ ble ... as a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell of his room came . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and was clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forget this od@@ our .
and I asked me : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering from another ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father went to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were tied to the eye . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were tied with the face down - all were at hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; in the vicinity of the entrance , people were silent to the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed I said to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What do you look like , ass@@ hole ? &quot;
&quot; I met &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me anything else ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a dit@@ ch and killed by soldiers .
I know this because my father told at home .
&quot; apart from La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero hit a man and killed another man .
&quot; according to the survivors of the civilian , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera , the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina was sentenced to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of the La Per@@ la memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way you came in here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apping came here . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number assigned as part of the trial .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement of the top arrived that they should be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of human beings and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war yield &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things with home .
&quot; at that time I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was to the military during the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - was clear to me that war is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military ab@@ stain@@ ing , which one has fought against an enemy . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is no military yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I was always asked how my father , the leader of security forces , could participate in this V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said : and you , who asc@@ end up to the road ? &quot;
you are no crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded rage , stroke me , and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you alone . &quot;
we don &apos;t need any other !
that was my father .
I have no only memory of him .
&quot; as I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll pul@@ lover from wool . both my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still made clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , he accused me of being a fellow soldier with this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay down to me what they wanted . &quot;
anyway I was there to announce .
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ able act . &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel ashamed . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if one has children only once , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops and recognis@@ es that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have been ec@@ lec@@ tured during the dictatorship . but for what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children perform ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl home with her mother , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
she was like our pet almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
&quot; again , I asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have just been able to bring them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but for which their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not even families who were handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
&quot; the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ ny act , which one can do to man . &quot;
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they brought machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ nants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and disp@@ osed somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; said my father . &quot;
but anything will always remain .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to declare it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just have said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the idea , showing my father , arose during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t know anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly and asked me , for what the whole survi@@ ving patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me what to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
&quot; you have committed horri@@ fic crime , and you have forced me as a child to participate . &quot;
&quot; he only answered , &quot; Well , I show me . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I filed the first display . &quot;
&quot; finally , I realized that he was a criminal . &quot;
nobody can imagine that I am pre@@ set . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest or at the end of the trial .
&quot; he was indicted for 416 off@@ ences : among them heavier , illegal confin@@ es in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death sequence in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 years of child . &quot;

the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish on the magn@@ itude of judgment .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial of crimes against 7@@ 16 victims were finally committed in August 1975 and December 1978 . &quot;
&quot; 43 And he was found guilty of crimes against humanity , and in 28 cases of lit@@ igation against humanity , and in nine cases lit@@ igation of between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were broken hands . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants were killed during the trial .

&quot; all the accused were members of the military , former military personnel , former police officer and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidnapped in June 1976 with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he raised the following words to the silent chamber :

a translation error does older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation errors at a center in Kyoto in which one can extend his driving licence .
the photo was spread in social media .
machining of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence in the last month witnesses of a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word of the k@@ itt@@ arius , the &quot; older drivers &quot; means , fal@@ sely , but perhaps also with a little back@@ pack , and # 8@@ 212 is also translated as a &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ist . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area , and in the building itself . &quot;
&quot; processing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , divided into the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was like to the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also who placed the local lo@@ ids on it . &quot;
the daily newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ correct English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; Dri@@ vers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; horri@@ ble motor@@ ist &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate if the gramm@@ atically &quot; &quot; El@@ der Dri@@ vers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) was replaced . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto &apos;s police ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the Kyoto pre@@ fecture . furthermore , it declared that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from trans@@ lators and that the translation was not checked in their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger was reported as follows :
&quot; it is very sorry that elderly people felt due to in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) for us , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News sat down somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan apart and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounces as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved , but is quite a reason to worry . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by seniors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , the seniors caused 1,@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of seniors caused accidents during the same period . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ ally non @-@ mentioned reporter brought comments in the article published by the article comments of the Light , which show , which pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese seem@@ ingly consp@@ ired against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo about the translation error was among others :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; horri@@ ble motor@@ ist &quot; ) not the reality ?
&quot; so the translation is not correct , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is spread throughout all Asia
translation errors are widely distributed in Japan and Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true treasure tro@@ ve for this bizarre bug in English .

the reasons for spreading trans@@ lators are varied .
&quot; for example , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to send him into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires active configuration of the target language - something that is in the case of native language . in general , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from the French into English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies don &apos;t employ employees with English as a mother tongue , who might make translations into English . this may be a mis@@ understanding of understanding , cost back@@ grounds , or relatively small number of English speakers that learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who even have no foreign employees , will still make translations into a company intern@@ ally . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered the best to be made , translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widely distributed - often with funny results .
&quot; the mis@@ erable phr@@ ases that arise through machine translations , indicate that this technique cannot replace any human trans@@ lators . this applies to several languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English formulation in Japan , including those who decor@@ ate T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only from st@@ ili@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood at all . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be still acceptable or rather harmless as jewelry . but of great companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto uses a serial source of translations for their translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protest and cen@@ sored measures in the internet and television
main page of the Port as &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y So@@ c@@ ie@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , 7 April , Venezuel@@ an Internet users found that no access to the online station Viv@@ op@@ lay had no access to the online station Viv@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that Internet access from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV is no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online station transfers the recordings of protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ positi@@ onal groups that oppos@@ e the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government . &quot;
&quot; protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the duties of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was coupled , and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezuel@@ an providers are closed again .
this is from the page of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers like Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , traditional media have been hes@@ itated on reporting on protests . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations urged them with fin@@ es and closure , when the Commission continues to report this as &quot; Call for Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable and informative national television channels , I have registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
amazing that it is still cheaper than to buy two litres of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a blocking of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online broad@@ caster . this also affects the website where the National Assembly carries its sessions . &quot;
&quot; earlier research studies of the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local Internet provider could sometimes use DNS . it is a technique that is in@@ correct by the DNS servers in@@ quiries of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or denied the request when calling for such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ it@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , was set up on Thursday 6th April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flo@@ res was transferred to Caracas live in prison . &quot;
Flo@@ res was defeated while he was found in custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went up again .
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : thus , the vene@@ er &apos;s access to multi @-@ media coverage is becoming increasingly difficult in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become s@@ cler@@ ks to get an apprentices@@ hip &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita child . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
&quot; today Tina for the rights of children and gath@@ ers witness other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shortened version of a report given by Global Vo@@ ices , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a budget , in which they did not eat together with the family that lived there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her studies at the University , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride over her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; she said that something has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita to work for the family . in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the shop is very simple : a large family with little money over their min@@ der@@ old son or her min@@ der@@ old daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange the child gets food , an apprentices@@ hip and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned in the case is that the children have to afford an inn@@ um@@ erable days of household work that will never be paid and abuse of abuse and abuse - and all this in the context of a contract that cannot lift . &quot;
&quot; as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go , practice is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite many complaints of human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing his studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas , especially young girls who are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , re@@ acted and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call the things at the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , is generally not silent in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who will close their daughter in the faith that they conclude their training in society and make something out of itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , which increases the girl with oneself and whose exploitation is just@@ i@@ fi@@ able to give someone a chance that would have no education , or maybe even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
&quot; when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will be experienced only many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experienced it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which is held in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of heavy stripes . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of former military operations Tom@@ ás Fer@@ reira , and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who worked as an official agency . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with just 3,000 inhabitants located 250 km east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ reira suffered a stick to Mar@@ ín , until they suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they emphas@@ ized that the murdered child was Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela who was deeply responsible for the death of the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery .
several dozen people came to protest together and demanded that there is no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , among which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the married couples and nearly 60 civil society organisations required an investigation into the case .
&quot; they want to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ reira , and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl . &quot;
&quot; if the case is before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark , if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is coming in front of judgment . &quot;
the daily life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
&quot; Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited for workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , she had to register and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to go all work , and began to sell on the street or on the market of sweets to earn money . &quot;
they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
&quot; in its employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that it was still time for learning . &quot;
they rose up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
&quot; on Fri@@ days , for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaning the living room , polished the furniture and likewise infected the ground . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time for learning . &quot;
&quot; the more she was done with learning , the more leisure time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library &apos;s library as food out of the fridge , &quot; she remembers . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the budget , an inhibit@@ or military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some desc@@ ending forced Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him , Editorial from opposition to be understood as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he tried to convince them to persu@@ ade the reports of the official media concerning the regime &apos;s regime , no faith . &quot;
&quot; he held her for intelligent , but did not stay with her . &quot; the host had found someone who heard that he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a would have heard that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who would speak to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , which would speak to their native language Guar@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they had the education that they had made , again , explains them . &quot;
&quot; however , it was completely clear that she had paid for everything that she had paid from them with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discri@@ minated in school . &quot; one thing , above which is almost never spoken , are m@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans whom Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed if they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , is Cri@@ ad@@ ita . &quot;
I was able to invite anyone home . I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clearly that I had belonged to any group . &quot;
isolation was the worst of everything &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .

Bill writes Egyptian users to register social media in order to register for the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections have recently agreed to a draft bill of &quot; regul@@ ators in terms of use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if he is accepted by Parliament , user may register social media in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , then a place would be established , which is instructed to use citizens to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , user would have to register their real names and staff numbers to use social networks to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if you fail to do this , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine of money . &quot;
&quot; the bill that consists of six par@@ agra@@ phs and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application defined on the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video editing and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is passed when it is assumed , as the design is supposed to be correct , as Egyptian authorities shall not register the user &apos;s users who are not able to register those who are not able to guarantee that the Egyptian government is unable to ensure that the Egyptian government is unable to ensure the regulation at level of social media enterprise . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , Parliament of Parliament and sponsors of the law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user names and user received a user name and a password to get through the fire@@ wall to get the Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to judge a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts and experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( on German &quot; Executive Research Programme &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt strongly of the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that same as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces that could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , then it means that they will be able to set up a strong surveillance system to support citizens that apply a auth@@ orization , or not . and that means a mad system to carry out the activities of human beings and to bring it to a trial process . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Legisl@@ ative Parliament and the Constitutional Committ@@ ees before going into the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his assumption and en@@ forcement will be successful or not , the design &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military monument in parliament , whose senses is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legislative power against Cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long sentence for those provided to thre@@ aten the public order to thre@@ aten the public order . &quot;

&quot; high above in the mountains of Kurdistan , in the northeast of Iraq , the veter@@ an H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq work to protect the indigenous Persian leop@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the Leop@@ ards who stri@@ ped through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to wild animals , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they always find less prey . &quot;
why is this certain species of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; how R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; is the Persian Leopard the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ory of the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and growth of the ecos@@ ystem depends on that a large pre@@ dat@@ ory animal is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard in the wild game is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore , R@@ aza breaks in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained be@@ ologist , R@@ aza passionate about another side of their country , which is not only of war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in field studies for six years on wild animals and in education programs of Nature Iraq .
&quot; since 2013 , she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 , making a protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region . &quot;

&quot; in early March 2017 , documented in the nor@@ theastern Japan &apos;s daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , which had been achieved in the last six years to rebuild the life of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima were triggered . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its seat in Sen@@ dai , located in the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was a popular pre@@ f@@ ect in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbor@@ hoods Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to be evacu@@ ated because of the tsun@@ ami destroyed all the coastal towns of the map .
&quot; in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture had already experienced a nuclear accident , because of this reason , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o showing progress under the local point of view which progress under six years later to rebuild the life of local authorities .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authorities as well as survey results of the affected themselves .
&quot; housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( the k@@ ins@@ ati@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures could be found in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima forms the final light at 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; still , six years after the disaster , evacu@@ ated by the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by Beh@@ ut@@ ak@@ u , was evacu@@ ated in final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple disaster , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in comfort . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people still lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such gu@@ esses . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 per cent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emer@@ gen@@ cies , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ates that were evacu@@ ated after the disaster were moved into final homes . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent . &quot;
the status of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools have been affected by the mis@@ fortune , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial building in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of f@@ isheries ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , at Fu@@ kus@@ hima , only 30 percent of f@@ isheries ports have been resum@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land , have moved large @-@ scale stock@@ pil@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that only a result of the atomic fact is , because only 690 hectares of 5 hectares destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , lie in the nuclear pl@@ ywood zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered far again , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far away . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 per cent at the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can only have 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that the disaster has almost half of the coastal inhabitants , as more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the indigenous population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine the overall image , the newspaper brought numerous surveys under the local population and evacu@@ ated by the evacu@@ ation . she asked them about the stand @-@ up and , as their reception has changed over the tsun@@ ami risk . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami consciousness under the local population of experience .
&quot; the survey carried that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local population , measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surveyed expect that there was still not enough in astro@@ ph@@ al prevention . &quot;
how about those who are evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
&quot; in its edition for the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also strengthened its attention to the position of evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima does not only have to experience the massive earthquake and the devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , dis@@ astro@@ phic atomic fact that Japan had to experience . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved in areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; after 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima off its home country pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; most of the evacu@@ ated areas are the most of the evacu@@ ated areas , who are still in comfort for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima . this is a building projects that will be part of the Olympic Games in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people come from other countries , who speak another language , the differences seem to be larger than the common areas . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recogni@@ zes that a more un@@ ites than it seems to be at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important because they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remember that the world is finally very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look forward to these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get fewer attention when they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly associated with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i Eg@@ her@@ man explains how the love of music worked for the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences which he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered in the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer had defeated him at a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , a demonstration against the head . nationwide millions of protest@@ ers participated in a protest against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a brain trau@@ ma and several fra@@ ctions . &quot;
doctors operated him on this Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma .
its condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , who spread rapidly in Brazil for a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures , the face of the police officer also identi@@ fies the face of police officers . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the Military Police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the incident in the case of active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; a police officer would be beaten by a demonstr@@ ators and landing on the intensive care station , his face would be turned on TV for six months and the entire oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net where you see how Mat@@ eus attacked from the police officer and several san@@ it@@ ters shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immer@@ sed in social networks . &quot;
&quot; in the below shown clip , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus down from the 50th second . &quot;
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users now have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , sailors . &quot;

Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here the activist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me was murdered by his father because he has been attacked the Occup@@ y Movement in secondary schools . and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva that has been attacked by a polic@@ emen who has attacked him with a stroke stock .
police custody
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where there was a brutal police raid against protest@@ ers last Friday . &quot;
&quot; protests at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to aband@@ on violence against protest@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media street protests since they focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window sho@@ ots . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo was targeted specifically on a broken glass windows to illustr@@ ate with a photo of their cover pages .
&quot; in contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a fire @-@ driven bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause . &quot;
this must also recognize if one is strict against any form of damage .
&quot; here the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives absurd , un@@ reasonable importance , and the typical violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ frontation with the police . &quot; &quot;
the villages of forgotten forgotten villages in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso law , nearly hundreds of sugar cane plants in Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a ) &quot;
&quot; the Pop@@ ular Con@@ gregation Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as a el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known that there is no notable sugar harvest on the spot . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar @-@ tube factories were lame .
&quot; after the awakening the sugar ro@@ wer industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost and after its plants , until only the smells of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
approximately 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves ane@@ w .
some variety the work .
others signed and comm@@ ute daily to the factories that still grin@@ d .
&quot; N@@ ene , a Sol@@ dier veter@@ an who opens up every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar ro@@ wer industry does not smoke its sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are once more active in the east , because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he was not expecting .
N@@ ene remembers that in Ma@@ ñ@@ as I would get the sugar cane factory but the promise was not kept .
&quot; the sugar tube industry has already the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , I@@ ne@@ ff@@ iciency , the poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the weather before a couple of decades , but the bad harvest are already no new@@ ness . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the church looked even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar tube industry was an economical need : 155 sugar cane mills were technically dated and hardly competitive they were in@@ capable of the country .
initial idea was to concentrate on production on the most efficient factories - the annual production goal was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories that can produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euros ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price increased from about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 through 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report published by the OECD and FAO , the Economic and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production level would achieve the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the day of today &apos;s day will go into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from that on , the process of re@@ structure in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the breaking down of a total of 98 sugar tube factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , is known about the closure of the factory , the word that he is repe@@ ating the most , &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot; &quot;
almost all respondents in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full time - working group . &quot;
&quot; prior to the first year , the first letters started to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially collected documents , which would be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see , and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ c Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve every decision . &quot;
&quot; from there on responsibility , the responsibility and letters came more frequently . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the dis@@ continued factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the remaining sugar cane mill . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waits for the retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved with his will at the breast@@ feeding of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with each part he removed , he dismant@@ led one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work@@ stations was extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives for the labor and services that were placed in the municipalities in which they were located , were created . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mamm@@ ut speech of October 21 , 2002 , then the former president in the eyes of the present persons saw that he had no longer run in the areas of their factories all over the past five years . &quot;
the price of the population for closure of the sugar cane mill
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is only extracted high by M@@ ays . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
&quot; after two years , the Con@@ gregation Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for better if a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane joined the sugar factory , or even better when they began to ab@@ rupt it , they also listened to asph@@ alted , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look up other factories . &quot;
they were given to spare parts .
&quot; without any future perspective , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not serve once for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working . &quot;
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty harvest@@ ing bring a retirement of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is not a tra@@ ctive person , yet he gives the lies that told him not . &quot;
they have been tor@@ ment for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene walks with 65 years in retirement , not because it is missing on power but because he is bitter@@ ness . &quot;

first Nations young@@ sters use Hip Hop Hop to express itself and maintain their own culture
recording of a song by &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
&quot; you@@ ths of the First Nations Communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them . they do with hip hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour , workshops can bring directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will ensure that the young participants in our conversations issues such as &quot; cultural Ident@@ ity , &quot; language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or whatever it comes to sense . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos that the young@@ sters are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ neb@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; in which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were missing or murdered . &quot;
cases were largely irrelevant .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ es@@ Cre@@ e First State uses the motive of a video game to mediate , how important the receipt of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of glob@@ alisation . &quot;

&quot; sometimes I feel like , nobody ever interested in me &quot;
but I &apos;m trying to continue my days on earth
this is the day you will take away our cry .
because we lost our way to life in life
but I believe that we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life

&quot; so , they can do that , for what it is intended for the Creator &quot;

&quot; in Japan , one can see plastic dishes in front of almost any restaurant . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers , what exactly is on the menu , will be found near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin sandy pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; Plast@@ ics &quot; &quot; models of the dishes &quot; ) from each food , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers are viewing this plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or continue .
there is a whole industry devoted to manufacturing this plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ oter district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small companies who also manufacture plastic dishes that documented the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; most Japanese are these plastic dishes such as usual that they do not once again after them . a new trend , however , turns them today in show@@ y mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; in Na@@ ver Mat@@ omes , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos depicting this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in the special sale : new with plastic dishes , decorated with plastic rib@@ bons , as they are presented in Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y colle@@ ges , as in this case , refriger@@ ator@@ mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ator@@ mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the essence is increasingly complicated .
&quot; in this case , a ka@@ ar @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone support . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use for this tri@@ angular bowl .
we also produced this part for the Tokyo Station in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that keeps your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a candle for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and this is only the beginning of an increasing flight home .
&quot; some cell @-@ support and mobile designer allow you to create your own artwork . in this case ik@@ ura and salmon are used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had doubts :
&quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can imagine my mobile phone with laugh@@ ing ? . &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant .
our latest cell phone support has the shape of mel@@ ody ice cream .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; further com@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be seen below : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter using the h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 , and will be on Twitter using the h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 . &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trends , this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi in the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , which is devoted to the adv@@ ancement of the restaurant industry . as for example , with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;

a Mexican project tells stories of the survi@@ ving struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of fighting against the drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; struggle against drug dealers &quot; in Mexico there are only one of the most not@@ orious and dr@@ um@@ erable Jews only in statistics . however , these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drugs such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pressed the stories of the conflict in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , someone is looking at the dream or to the congregations who have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each body , behind each bone of a secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds maybe never heal . &quot;
this is why the Mexican news portal animal p@@ í@@ tico launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug dealers &quot; ) to live this victims and tells stories of people who were in the struggle between prosec@@ ut@@ ors authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime leaves us not only to fear our lives .
the imp@@ lications are much deeper .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and so many municipalities have to drive so many kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
the Pain of Vic@@ tims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changed &quot; ) tells those stories .
&quot; a main character is Guad@@ alu@@ pe , a father , who is seeking secret tom@@ bs every weekend after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father , her four brothers , her husband , and two of her ne@@ phe@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today again on the task of getting rid of us , go to the graves , after the people we loved to seek . &quot;
Guad@@ alu@@ pe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprentices@@ hip . &quot;
&quot; even my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , it has no income . &quot;
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but she does not get paid out because they demand a death customer . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ it@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we do not only have to show the faces of those who seek fear . we have to show the international community the conflicts that frag@@ ility and state management .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of animal pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post by Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with the disease and sens@@ ory journ@@ alism for some years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with pictures that can only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or files from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel the feeling as if I am the only one , ref@@ uted or sad . it seems like a lack of respect toward the person who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I can &apos;t be in@@ correct or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 year old C@@ ousin thinks that he is great . and it is not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of off@@ ender , if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , that , when would they have fallen to those who have lost someone , and those who have fear that something happened to them . &quot;
&quot; I see our weakness , when stories become blo@@ wn out numbers in a statistic . &quot;
&quot; the crime of human beings is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students are justified in one neighbour that they were &quot; growing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to talk about this trage@@ dies , if they don &apos;t touch and still be silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; four months of express in the main city district : like a family with threats pl@@ under@@ ed , &quot; she describes how armed crimin@@ als destroyed money from their business until the end not only destroyed the business but also their family apart . &quot;
&quot; you think of everything you have lost and remember , as some people can change your whole life in just a few days . &quot;
&quot; pain is never passes away , the trau@@ ma remains high again , when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers also . &quot;
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will bring you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these fear@@ ful days , if weeping would dissolve my profound feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to weep . I have to learn how to live with pain . &quot;
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a new generation of power .
in the introduction he raises questions about how : who cares about the child of a missed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
what is it to grow in a settlement on the ver@@ ge of the most dangerous city Mexican ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Bryan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tortillas and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of the fl@@ acon with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody Lei@@ che of his father saw that of armed men had been shot by an passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Bryan was born in 2006 , when violence was organised by the organised crime and fighting with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of citizens to public security and the government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Prosec@@ ution had 3@@ 103 murders per day . this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day . &quot;
&quot; these are only some of hundreds of thousands of thousands of stories , which leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the country &apos;s soul . &quot;
&quot; few stories still live in view of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose aim is to illustr@@ ate the complex information behind the failed fight against drug dealers who has tortured the country in the past four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing , from Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Ni@@ kl@@ as wi@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which it is linked , include pictures , on which violence is represented . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to raise a sc@@ aff@@ old , or to un@@ mask a fake . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years after the first time appeared ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to exist . &quot;
&quot; for seven years ago , we take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) . &quot;
&quot; since its first release , it has been used to de@@ form@@ alise trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false copy of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - Do not deny the fact that there are ample careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
it raises questions about our desire to pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 a tank car crossed the place S@@ ange in the East of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . 230 people were killed . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa had been negle@@ cted and destroyed by Africa . the streets in the region became a dangerous path full of impact holes that were difficult to ride . &quot;
trag@@ ically fell victim to the victims of the tank car .
&quot; representative representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses covered including a cinemas close by , which was full of people who illustr@@ ate the football World Cup . &quot;
houses conce@@ aled and seduc@@ ed cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to un@@ mistak@@ ably .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 . January 201@@ 5. more photos of the fore@@ man form the grey scenes of this day . &quot;
one example is an example .
&quot; it shows rows of carbon@@ ated bodies , which grows on the ground , while they have a look at them . &quot;
but here the story do not find her end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was f@@ ished by several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but unfortunately , real but not to be attributed to trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar ?
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
witnesses reported dra@@ stically from atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports that 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; nobody remained back to count bodies , &quot; said a population on Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were destroyed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only using satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am , country ( examples of 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the image of the DR Congo re@@ appeared , as a evidence for the fact and the possible extent of attack was presented : &quot;
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ concep@@ tions ; Africa Check has been documented assign@@ ments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; another step further will bring personal comments , such as this example fal@@ sely , the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments . &quot;
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash message , those who were described by the United Nations , those who were able to flee battles , rape and some dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts , like the following , brought together these descriptions of the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture is taken from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news page , which was wr@@ ong@@ ly claimed that President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an has said that monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to ass@@ ure this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , who called AFP , as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed to His statement , but had not taken the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the world @-@ wide range of false data
&quot; tracks of this wrong cou@@ plings date back to the years 2011 and 2012 , and actually come from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; using a &quot; reverse picture search &quot; you can see how far more information can be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search engine with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 images below 18,@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 pictures , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixing mas@@ ch private pages , platforms social media and common publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded false reports , others have tried to un@@ mask the forg@@ eries . &quot;
&quot; we have added examples of the use of mis@@ use and associated with the respective countries , based on what page it had been published . by doing so , we want to display the range more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
several examples are used for mis@@ use in some countries ( which were also associated with each other ) in some cases ( in some cases ) .
&quot; here are some cases , which can now be seen completely completely ( on the map in orange ) : &quot;
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false cou@@ pl@@ ets from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ based countries refer to pages or server which are still available via the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ se@@ ality .
&quot; the countries in Grau are examples that are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably counter@@ feit methods . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was post@@ pon@@ ed in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly stated that the image of the DR Congo will NOT show Muslims to kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 &quot;
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein agreed in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the p@@ liers .
&quot; the article has been updated 2014 and , at the time of this publication , the painting continues to contain . &quot;
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 &quot;
&quot; this article of 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am were published , published by the Catholic near @-@ standing news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture is not taken by the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ st @-@ dist@@ al attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the picture later , in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to contra@@ dict that there would be connections to Nigeria . &quot;
Turkey in 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ d@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns that sleeps ) .
&quot; the image of the DR Congo appeared , marked with this t@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and at the Charlie Heb@@ do massacre in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities found these events that were suspected in the name of Islam , a larger attention . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
the picture was we@@ ath@@ ered as a cover for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times saved ) . but the messages that were associated with no religious context were captured in no religious context .
&quot; instead , the target was to set attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that supposedly had been written by a &quot; &quot; Fr Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; over the Nig@@ erian massacres , in circulation , there were discussions how this here on Vietnamese and declared it to fal@@ se@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the image of the DR Congo was contained , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos were dist@@ anced . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of a defective use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , ag@@ gregation and pages in the following countries ( on portfolio in grey ) are also tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp exist on the we@@ cra@@ wler and disp@@ utes them in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original accident in 2010 , the image may finally be a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( Explo@@ itation ) that passes these posts . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in regards to greater discussions about the silence on the silence of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the m@@ ord@@ ations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life has been assessed in comparison to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investig@@ ating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers cannot give this pictures longer faith . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are dirty people who have un@@ intended to have the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; well , this senti@@ ment of the mal@@ - and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and nar@@ ro@@ wed it to the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of non@@ violent pictures have already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; a argument is that this comes back from pictures of a ref@@ us@@ al to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures even demands of the victims itself . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images readers and viewers Des@@ en@@ si@@ bil@@ ize and give them the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( for example , this study , how violent media act on it to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while some regard to discuss non@@ violent represent@@ ations in the news press , fact , fact that they are essential for today &apos;s news coverage . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you &apos;ll have to think about the situation in which a picture is somewhat sug@@ ary , but what actually can be used in context or completely mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; every investigation , however , should take into consideration how international can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Simmons uses according to CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.@@ g un@@ mistak@@ eable ) stri@@ ves to provide language avi@@ es a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated .
&quot; such words exist in any language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these un@@ mistak@@ able words are well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ dom@@ esa ) .
but everyone resi@@ sts stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt to a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation , and sometimes a part is necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists include Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u &apos;s VAT language , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Make your parents in recognition of how to stri@@ ve for yourself in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth , which you feel after getting caught in cold days in the sun . &quot;
&quot; in Bir@@ ds , in his own words , About : &quot;
&quot; they det@@ ach@@ ers other cultures , reveal other bands , and wake up our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , as we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the Lingu@@ ists on this page , more of these &quot; un@@ mistak@@ eable &quot; words show how different , valuable and impressive are these small languages . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treasure Languages &quot; , &quot; which are appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to download their favourite words here . &quot;

&quot; how Sri Lanka is surrounded with the worst flood catastrophe of the decade , &quot;
the island of Sri Lanka is currently the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slides in this decade .
&quot; the mon@@ soon , who usually enters in late May , are characterized by strong rainfall in the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; following a statement by the cat@@ astro@@ phic centre of Sri Lanka , 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and scar@@ cely hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and sli@@ pper . &quot;
more than 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe residence .
&quot; the rainfall took place on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water volumes in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene areas of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos con@@ vey an impression of the extent of the flood catastrophe :
&quot; flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water walls of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation . &quot;
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly flu@@ ent wor@@ shi@@ ped the Den@@ gu@@ ef@@ in crisis , save Save the Children , after further rain@@ falls already on the way . &quot;
&quot; this morning , Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stood in the floods , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da is flooded with g@@ all , due to the passing of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force made five planes for rescue operations , and another five will be made ready for transport deliveries into their flooded villages . &quot;
various organizations and start @-@ ups have also explained to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ I@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high @-@ water situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for everyone who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ necessary goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this field .
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ uf @-@ App Pick@@ me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app , so that the cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ centre will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ anu , Pic@@ Me introduced a &quot; High Water Aid &quot; button to help users to pick up a vehicle for pick@@ up assistance and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ an Red Cross . &quot;
they also led to a &quot; SOS button &quot; to adopt more than thousand en@@ quiries and 150 successful bo@@ ret@@ inal inter@@ actions for floo@@ ding and land@@ slides .
&quot; the agreed efforts of the government and the civilian population Sri L@@ ank@@ as , where several social media platforms are fully de@@ pl@@ eted , they bring residents in need in need of security and help Hil@@ fem@@ aid . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka is the long way to recovery the norm@@ ality . &quot;

use of the .@@ Dam@@ as in January I participated in the women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
&quot; I trusted her my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts to me her children : she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in the one minute , we are calling for the rights of women . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we will en@@ code rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some hold the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from a American flag , other en@@ c@@ tures par@@ ol@@ es against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; these things do not affect you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; why , because I &apos;m not the Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot;
I already managed this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which was built in their imagination . &quot;
they de@@ mus@@ li@@ ze me .
&quot; worldwide , there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide . &quot;
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , on different art . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is well constructed in our collective imagination , that as the Muslims , as I do not fit there , can be mus@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
de@@ mus@@ li@@ zed are to be mi@@ li@@ zed
I don &apos;t understand that alone .
this is even the poet that poetry is best selling in America : Rum@@ i .
what images come in a sense if you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was now , he was an orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; the Quran , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western imagination , religion Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims from this world .
&quot; another consists in the reduction of Muslims , the Western books have been colonial for centuries . &quot;
this temp@@ ting picture language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the landmark Palestinian scientist Edward Said broke the story behind this pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures still stand out today .
our politicians to continue the news industry and Hollywood .
&quot; I have been working for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen , as these powerful , faul@@ t@@ ant sc@@ r@@ atives domin@@ ate our news feeds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ativ overs@@ ha@@ do@@ wed reality , which in the last three decades , nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ tri@@ pod fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are en@@ forced to carry their head@@ scarf in public buildings , and Saudi women to cover their entire body to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group pract@@ ises his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot;
this strong nar@@ row@@ ness weak@@ ens Muslim women to conduct movements for change .
&quot; it is obvious that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ kan@@ ers , which were taken with slave ships . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this nar@@ tri@@ pod has occupied our collective pres@@ ordin@@ ation of so deep and in@@ correct , that often S@@ ik@@ h Men and Children become the aim of anti @-@ tim@@ us@@ sian attacks and sc@@ ik@@ es . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and about the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the others . &quot;
the 1.7 billion belong
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or to alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ r@@ ative that help us understand the world .
&quot; and in this respect , my industry failed to capture the Nar@@ r@@ ativ of the 1.7 billion . &quot;
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims live in the highest degree &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ sto@@ cky Americans .

&quot; back then , when Khan thought out the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were immense Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now an adju@@ v@@ ated Muslim and American woman ?
&quot; sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out my Muslim recipes or carry my hand T@@ ash@@ enk@@ or@@ an all the Muslims with themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I am kid@@ ding we are not wearing all T@@ ash@@ b@@ or@@ ane with us .
we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected by almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists , and inter@@ religious activists who stri@@ ve to combat widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the current volume of a well decorated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with monetary aggreg@@ ates , think tanks and experts for counter@@ parts , which is our already fl@@ aw@@ ful picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;

I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but was born as a Muslim , but was born until I was four years old when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ial church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientist describe religious life , they attack the following concepts : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my neighbor , see my rock in the fire that I am Muslim when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that would separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the all@@ ual rit@@ ual with my daughter , when I kept them in my arms , and you are called the Arab verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ uls . &quot;
&quot; each of them , I repeat three times . &quot;
&quot; I pray therefore , that they are protected from evil , evil which you can see and evil which you cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging is the image of my grandmother &apos;s maternal part with her sisters ; as they win a competition from the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can be almost custom@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim , means to speak prayers that she had said to me if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Muslim is to be as she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who became colonial - over centuries - through a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; , &quot; which has founded a company with the name hon@@ orable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to call the Lord my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; affili@@ ation means to grow up and hear that men don &apos;t cry , but at the same time I cri@@ es my first grandfather . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books about the modern Islam and over the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ disputed about his family in India , he was not allowed to close his family in half a century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families were torn apart by my grandfather , from col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as the risk . &quot;
Muslim a means to know that in the past two centuries Europeans have been colon@@ ised all to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first Fli@@ eg@@ i@@ ore was thrown over a Muslim country in front of a Muslim country .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , a Indian , natural sub@@ jection of the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; since he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were air@@ crafts , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever had and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; to my Muslim tribe of 1,7 billion people belong to our unforgettable family trees , our un@@ plug@@ ged story . &quot;
&quot; it means that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops that had been spread over every continent apart from the Antar@@ c@@ tica , to pursue weapons of mass destruction that do not exist . &quot;
it means that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
&quot; in 2001 , an American Muslim means that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that if a tragedy is home to the United States and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the history of four times more will be reported as a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four hundred years ago , the first prayer of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was proclaimed by a liberated black slaves named Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this country . &quot;
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
&quot; it is the hope I feel , when we arise for our dreams , and if we &apos;re going to count black life . &quot;
&quot; an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim , a Muslim , a Muslim , and a journalist , signi@@ fy the inher@@ ent inter@@ se@@ duction of our ident@@ ities , but to fail to communicate to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ r@@ ativ of 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cubes , but is represented in the reduced branch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to take care of my child , and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons are er@@ ect on this branch of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia consists in the Muslim stops , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama . &quot;
it is in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; in immigration , it consists of a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; there is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders over people from just countries , which is bom@@ bed . &quot;
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &apos; no @-@ fly list &apos; which takes largely Arabs and Muslims into the visor .
&quot; there are wars , which we lead and the bombs we throw to Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the stories we tell and about those who we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western university participants showed a scientific un@@ true image and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 . &quot;
Muslims received the least points .
the conversation which we have to lead
&quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to reveal the Muslim , or the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
we stand for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ t@@ ful and dangerous expressions that we unite in our news productions .
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry that tries to capture our multiple ident@@ ities and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the po@@ d@@ cast Lake Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the po@@ d@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Bad@@ ge ; the vir@@ ale Vide@@ os@@ erie Secret Li@@ ves of Pos@@ ad , an initiative to print Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American Super@@ hero , and all this makes me hope . &quot;

&quot; but I &apos;m concerned about this difficult global time point , in which we are located . &quot;
this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that swe@@ ars theore@@ ti@@ cian that existing in the dark corners of the internet now that the White House result .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by having created the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; a few years before , it had not been given yet ; now they rule over large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the real@@ ities and the story , which I was not aware of how it was so old , as it is now my daughter , but who made me today an un@@ disputed Muslim . &quot;
things I have left here like a bread cr@@ ec@@ umen@@ ical track in my speech .
&quot; things you may wake up memories , as in all the inter@@ se@@ clu@@ tions which our humanity passes , likes a story , where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversation within the 8th Annual Meeting of Islam@@ opho@@ bia takes place . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American milit@@ ar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools or we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I t@@ ame this here with this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Said , the man who has shown us how wars are being led and people through the monkeys of the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , some four decades even scientific of Stan@@ ford was . &quot;
&quot; we have to un@@ com@@ fy ourselves un@@ comfortable questions about the role of what , consci@@ ously and un@@ consci@@ ously imagine the &quot; others &quot; ; as it did not succeed in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we did not have a new future , as he had already en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated countries and &quot; among other people , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ ative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story of stor@@ yt@@ ellers , by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
&quot; can there be a possibility , here and now , in spite of a language barrier with someone in connection ? &quot;
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the stories of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ mistak@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; however , here is the focus of T@@ LS not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain the language diversity of major cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Oak@@ land , in the United States , where T@@ LS has been carried out since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not given to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass mortality of the world can be avoided , when we create cities , accept diversity - safe rooms where people are not forgotten , who they are to be moved . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often associated to understand &quot; &quot; these events instead , &quot; listening to appreciate , feel to link . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers put their story first in their own language and translate or declare it in English . &quot;
&quot; although the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their de@@ vot@@ ion , and their representation , is that the listen@@ er can appear on it . &quot;
&quot; they call to laugh and emotions , as the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional history from Burkina Faso , who is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou sees the opportunity to explain the most typical customs of stories of stories . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the b@@ abel of the rab@@ bit and the Pa@@ vian language in Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after expl@@ aining the meaning of his cable , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ un@@ es he shares his feeling of exclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and organis@@ ers hope to extend this . all those who are inspired by the project can be able to contact T@@ LS in contact with T@@ LS in contact with T@@ LS . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the United States to re @-@ establish the sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , who participated in a mass demonstration on the past 3 April 2017 , various religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the San Ju@@ an &apos;s capital city , and went to Plaza de Col@@ ón . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ da@@ d@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da ( Citi@@ zen on the ne@@ ural examination of debt ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ian Church of Puerto Rico .
&quot; in addition , the advoc@@ ate of the re@@ constitution of the debt also submitted a pet@@ ition on the official website of the White House of the United States . &quot;
this is their claim :
&quot; the people of Puerto R@@ os demands that the politicians , banks and government agencies , who are responsible for the debt of their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for financial testing and an open lead committee without personal interests in public debts , with a solid , our working conditions corresponding compensation , in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto R@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king pension@@ ers .
we require immediate action .
the island - not integrated in the State of State of the United States - suffers from a serious financial crisis .
&quot; hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on the soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law responsible for the sovereign state of state . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto R@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; from outside , measures will be imposed without participation and conviction of the danger of being rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration was named &quot; Night@@ watch for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missed since more than one year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continued the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions which he did for an open net . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture organised in Berlin , dedicated to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara Rü@@ hl@@ ing , Managing Director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , las@@ ered excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ ner ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective reflection ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and licensed here , contains a number of par@@ agra@@ phs that deal with free culture in the face of supp@@ ression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it says :
&quot; this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge and what the real costs are , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have been working on page to look beyond the fog that gives our news@@ feeds to create something from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us will start to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we abandoned in this process of time extreme convic@@ tions ?
&quot; since March 2012 , the web developer of open source and digital activity is Syrian government agencies . &quot;
&quot; in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution to be transferred to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel made on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was cont@@ acted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who presented himself as the insi@@ der of the Assad government and put them in an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
his place and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in the Internet access to the Internet and to knowledge around the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the leader of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps there was none of Bass@@ els cultural prototypes as the work which he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , to con@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous ci@@ vil@@ is@@ ations and the Greek @-@ roman architecture types with hi@@ es@@ ky traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ sel could not know that ten years after working with this work , the IS was going to put everything about this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this m@@ aturing stage into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a tim@@ eli@@ ke , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of inv@@ alu@@ able . &quot;
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not yet close this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my entire life so , of freedom to dream and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call its name .
&quot; Bas@@ sel brought me English , even when he was in prison . &quot;
I have learned to read and speak English well .
&quot; he always has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bas@@ sel opened my gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computer as well as smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other det@@ ain@@ ees , as they use computers , at least in theory without fact that they actually held one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ vocation , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in custody . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
&quot; she sm@@ ug@@ gled the lyrics to him , when she visited him , and he translated it out of Arabic into English . &quot;
the book is licensed free .

bass &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , the Syrian Network for Human Rights since the beginning of 2011 . &quot;
those who were arrested or executed under violence against the regime were tortured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , according to international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrian in prison since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community calls for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : sentenced to imprisonment for corruption in prison for corruption
&quot; Mozambique acted to a corrupt case with anger , at which a government member after half of his sentence was returned to the workplace in the state apparatus . &quot;
&quot; this is where Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 , along with four other def@@ endants with four other def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from Mozambique , whose Council Cam@@ b@@ aza was CFO between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately demanded its re@@ setting into the company , what happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the General At@@ tor@@ ney of the Republic , which was submitted for the application , there would be no obst@@ acle reason for Cam@@ b@@ aza to return to his old position , since the company had not moved to its detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants are not good . &quot;
&quot; the center for Public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle decided to establish the director of the company in an interview : &quot;
&quot; a set@@ back in the fight against corruption , and signi@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step in regard to the efforts of our law@@ suit , such as C@@ IP . &quot;
&quot; what we need to know is , that the company should have a disciplinary procedure to oppos@@ ing the grants . &quot;
&quot; however , the company doesn &apos;t seem to worry about appropriate legal steps for the application of the relevant functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mozambique social media , ref@@ uses this behavior and considered the case as &quot; contradic@@ ted &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of them has taken away . &quot;
he could hold lectures and motiv@@ ating words he could advise and turned his image .
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped harm . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence . &quot;
resi@@ stible !
&quot; bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ence , and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not have any mor@@ ality : &quot;
&quot; cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state because he bel@@ ated him , I cannot believe that somebody is rewarded for such a way that the state has already insul@@ ted so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ ality and serve the State , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served in the state instead . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state in order to become an in@@ exhau@@ stible money source , and the state itself is we@@ ary of this man , who was pre @-@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the prime minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a thief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el in the prison of Sam@@ ora , but not only as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , single @-@ reaching , and - next to the prophe@@ tic speaker . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , when he was energetic , confirmed that &quot; an ambitious human being able to be able to sell his own individual interest , even the father@@ land for his amb@@ itions . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know whether a ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he does not turn off its amb@@ itions . &quot;
an ambitious human is criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , reactions were also declined : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down 10 years and came free . &quot;
&quot; and today he sets him out of the company , in which he has been exp@@ elled , again under the contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ - gn@@ u ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017 &quot;

Facebook has been blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means Ki@@ cher@@ erb@@ sis or Sp@@ an Age .

&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network made its posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although about the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to reject people in eastern indi@@ an origin or generally used as ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; or more , ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese Scri@@ ptures ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of Hass@@ language in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely slim con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word which usually uses ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as Hass@@ speak against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight Hass@@ language in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on his platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself calls not automatically hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that , in which they have discussed the use of the Word , or have doubts about the use of the Word , have been cen@@ sored . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same accounting sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair in Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ old ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ user A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends on the spirit of intellectual , whether they could not know how he could relie@@ ve his back pain by shooting a p@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the set ku la - &quot; C@@ ure &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) to Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ itt is the opinion that they can reduce Hass@@ language radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook has to be analy@@ tic before it extingu@@ ish all the po@@ sts that will bring rac@@ ism in the sus@@ pic@@ ion of rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
the word will be used automatically .
automation will not understand what you are writing on fac@@ tions .
&quot; what to do instead , is carefully analy@@ zing the mail and control it by checking the opposite words . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spher@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that this dirty nation@@ alists , spread hate @-@ language , received a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it &apos;s time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action is able to send a strong signal to all , the hate language , the efficiency of this strategy can not stop long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ orship of percussion often becomes a cat@@ z@@ - and mouse game , with the users &apos; social networks simply start to use a new word or an alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views . &quot;
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook has started to er@@ ase his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
&quot; when I was watching this new gui@@ deline of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends , that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; ir@@ on@@ ically , my post office is removed from Facebook and told me the li@@ ken , post and sharing of content for 24 hours , because the post office &quot; &quot; the Facebook Community standards did not exc@@ use . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has a multitude of posts from people away , which have no negative int@@ entions , or who just try to show their opinions against the enemy radic@@ ally nation@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail has been removed , which has nothing to do with Hass@@ language : &quot;
post without Hass@@ talk of Facebook .
in the post the author divided his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
&quot; on the beginning of the initiative , Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook would have to do more about the beginning of the initiative , for example : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a pleasant intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
such words become cen@@ sored only even more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , as if they have started this without local context or technical support , and so words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; Erb@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; have banned . &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they did not have mistakes , they did not attempt to report the fal@@ sely dissolved Po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they only have something more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would make them a large turnover , would that be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks Auto c@@ ens@@ orship has provided a lot of mo@@ ckery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make more fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ language to see if their posts will be taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate language , but still removed : &quot;

the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch the pe@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
&quot; just try to try out whether Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the violence in social networks shall use violence in the municipalities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine territory , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands of escape . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to talk to his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
&quot; but rather than just using the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better look at the context than on the code of concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago at the end of Tob@@ ago
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 . &quot;
the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the country of the country unanimously decided to offer a law that is supposed to offer this practice , so that the married age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of the husband , some members of du@@ alistic and Muslim religious communities were held in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ osh@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups in the country , said that the state should not inter@@ fere with the state that the state does not im@@ itate maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contra@@ ctual partner of the UN Children Rights Convention , defined under the min@@ ors of men under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 indicate that the proportion of children that were already married with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 were 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the statistical Agency of the country confirmed that by 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married at 19 . &quot;
&quot; online pet@@ ition@@ ing and social media movements , which stri@@ ves to abol@@ ish laws on the fo@@ oth@@ ills , followed by the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped forward this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du guide , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the child before they should take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition campa@@ igned for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated thing and some point when the opposition would agree to the bill of law .
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the child before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent that contained themselves - so that he would make a simple majority to the law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update for Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle again on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : Bill &apos;s bill in the House of Represent@@ atives before the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one decided against it in the House of Represent@@ atives .
&quot; after he previously decided in the Senate , the design can now become the law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws have been changed for child before .
&quot; a Facebook member of Lov@@ ell Francis , which was a Minister of Education in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary tann@@ ede , which caused the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago it is worth every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel was the opinion , it was definitely enough to take the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ e @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , &quot; Excell@@ ent News ! &quot;
the husband &apos;s network has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , devoted to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society which openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law , noted : &quot;
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now 18 years independent from the religious affili@@ ation .
&quot; the draft on May 9 , 2017 , was decided on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 MPs , and of which 35 were present at the vote . &quot;
&quot; all members who were against , voted for the law . &quot;
children in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are no longer permitted .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ is@@ cation .

&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite Mahar@@ aj , the General Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country . &quot;
&quot; prior to months , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to under@@ take judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to invite his promise now . &quot;
&quot; during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law said that Mahar@@ aj could go against the law , the most social media users , you would wish to change the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so generally speaking , in a way that we invite you to talk to the state in our bedrooms , that the state , our daughters to be ab@@ used in the advantage , would you be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think it is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether there is a judicial approach against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children are legally legal or still the norm , although there are laws which they may under@@ go . &quot;
h@@ ack@@ ers tro@@ t the office of the state of state in front of national protests at the Russian National Day
screen print of the message that was posted on Sunday early on the website of the district of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l .
&quot; on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption that coinci@@ de with the day of Russia - the Russian national celebration , the website of the State Court of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l became h@@ acked . the h@@ ack@@ ers have left a funny message &quot; stay at home . &quot;

at 11.@@ 15 the message from the page was removed - but in the cache they remained .
it is # gentle
&quot; on Sunday , the Office of State Court gave the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were min@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; through the sk@@ e@@ wers of websites , Turkish users can watch Wikipedia content again . &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia page was signed on January 18 , 2012 , at the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA Copyright legislation in the United States , internationally . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; since more than one month , Turkey has now closed the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day for day , it is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful as well as reliable information . &quot;
both students and rep@@ orters and fans of TV @-@ series fight against the lock .
&quot; although many technologies have been used , use tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; even though Turkey has been edited by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , finding regular block@@ ades of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship by Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains closed , there are now several mirrors ( sites that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator calcul@@ ator ) , which makes itself a complete c@@ ens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; the content is , despite a legal prohibition , however . &quot;
&quot; in a Blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts : &quot;
&quot; after having heard the messages ( regarding the lock of Wikipedia ) , we were able to put snap@@ shots of Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this may help users to see at least any Wikipedia content , even if they can not reach the www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ .org website . &quot;
&quot; in addition , IP@@ FS was also implemented that this step is independent of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and is only about screen@@ shots and any live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock . &quot;
&quot; Crist@@ ian Cons@@ onn@@ i from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ knock pe@@ .org , an open source project that everyone can use to ho@@ sten similar mirrors to ho@@ ists , when it is locked in the country Wikipedia . &quot;
Cons@@ onn@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices and employee at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; po@@ d@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a Mir@@ ror . &quot;
&quot; one can attack another URL , which is not the original . that which one sees , is by Wikipedia . &quot;

&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with bad @-@ positioned moti@@ ves and wav@@ ed colours . &quot;
the motivated him to wear a camera with oneself and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ as animal world stri@@ ves to bring to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and its home location right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos depicting the attention to Nep@@ als animal world . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps in his work :
&quot; live on the border of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photographers ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the Manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river a leop@@ ard .
the river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I got off with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
&quot; my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river , where the Leopard was located and I immediately began to roll down pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als Nature and would like to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening as they look like .
&quot; and he should know it , because he had already standing Tig@@ ers from face to face : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b himself from the opinion of sheep ! !
late evening . light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I was also because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ k appeared . he immediately puts us immediately , and he looked at me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
&quot; his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als Nature and wild animals , however , is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent in order to take photos in Bar@@ dia National Park Rec@@ ordings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took until he took a tiger , and live six to seven days for the perfect photograph of birds living near the tourist information . &quot;

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a , and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India . &quot;
a revised version was re @-@ released as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India they avoid women with the greatest care , the names of their husbands , or even of older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband because of the social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should use the norm to maintain this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a pseu@@ do@@ court and contra@@ sted by her family and the village community after having addressed a married relatives with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of tradition also not name their wives by name , is also common among men . however , they have far fewer assign@@ ments to fear if any of them , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of Pun@@ e , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health staff and house@@ wives , a unique club and became fast to the main topic of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the host@@ esses of the Patri@@ arch@@ s .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that there are in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ bath , which is operated by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and sets itself for the removal of the Patri@@ arch@@ s . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of her video era at the discovery of practices , such as child marriage to the ban of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS infected , and runs this club . &quot;
it reports about how this clubs have created a safe place for this women and they have made them at the same time as ambassador inside the mur@@ al .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini shows in their discussion group , did women who call their husbands at the name . &quot;
&quot; she decided this topic , because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem , with which women can identify easily . &quot;
&quot; according to the names of their husbands , there is a customs which they pleaded not guilty to all the liability and never challenged . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition tells us that a woman respects her husband and wish him a long life .
&quot; a woman who doesn &apos;t hold this , is viewed as a mist@@ ice as a woman without mor@@ ality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never made thoughts about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to try her husband so far at the name , who had never tried at home with her husband as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother in law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was at the end .
&quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that there was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to bring discussion with a exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked any participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our husbands , but they can call us how they want , that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their husbands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the Bre@@ chen of a century @-@ old tradition in which married women &apos;s names never to speak . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells us :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise , she only decided to ti@@ fy it ; another decided to release all his fru@@ stration against him and his family , conf@@ essing it . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in addition to that , in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ an exchange with an ancient bre@@ eder , the women decided that they would actually try to be home their husbands at home . &quot;
and they stopped their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a lot of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put the women in his head : his wife could not cease to say his name .
another club member decided to do it at supper before the entire family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she was stub@@ born , she was afraid , and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said that I should do it .
a husband of an participant in was less understand@@ able and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reported how women tried to stop other practices , such as the carrying case of interest in the forehead , which shows the marriage status : &quot;
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he would do it . &quot;
he only laughed and I heard him to bear him .
&quot; the other women stopped not complete with it , but they , they are now in a better position to choose himself , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the Disc@@ ussion @-@ lu@@ b is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives . &quot;
&quot; we do a trip with every Disc@@ ussion lu@@ b .
&quot; normally , we pack lunch and water and go out to the box . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to take care of the women , who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; dancing and sang and spoke about things that they never had thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working for so many years to these problems and yet , I have been working on some things , for example as our ident@@ ities to our husbands , never so hon@@ estly . &quot;
&quot; it feels great , certain things can say loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothes .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; most of them is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ ad @-@ Kur@@ ta , wearing a wide shirt of a tro@@ users ; they have not dar@@ ed themselves . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of dispute and discussion about the mer@@ its of its own wardrobe , mor@@ ality associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , decor@@ ating Roh@@ ini her own couple Cur@@ tas ( upper hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can carry Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to get it . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether , in the five months since their first discussion was already changed , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into the roles : &quot;
we have done only little steps so far .
some women tried it a few times but then they stopped to say the name of her husband .
&quot; some , including me , make it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot;
only one or two will continue to say the names of their husbands ; only one or two women carry out Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red in their forehead .
&quot; the women in Disc@@ ussion lu@@ b know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the fet@@ ch of freedom of movement or its own wardrobe - at the end of a hard to navigate the river . &quot;
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tell other people about what we &apos;re talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping people for the organic trade , probably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , troubled the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations into life to stop the practices . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district Mil@@ k , a few kilometres from the border of Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims were be@@ headed and part of the organs were taken from .
&quot; two men were arrested and arrested in the episode , that the organs of Sh@@ am@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used . &quot;
&quot; there is the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a young man &apos;s gold enth@@ ron@@ ged or wealth , the police declared the police officer of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks have been registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the aim of awakening for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN held a mission in the South African country to investigate these practices .
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of the southern African country , especially in neighbouring Tanzania where the government campaigns to fight these super@@ st@@ itions and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who have to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are the target of rit@@ ual men in Mozambique are the target rit@@ ual attacks , warned the Mozambique police following the latest exploration of three gl@@ ances of men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the town of In@@ ham@@ b@@ ane in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police have already lost the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the lab@@ ans are involved in the death of the young men .
&quot; the persecution and killing of people of family individuals for the extraction and selling of their organs in Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for probably super@@ st@@ itious ritu@@ als , has given cultural moti@@ ves and is believed to have faith in the head , according to which the victims of the head have might have the wealth of wealth . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ reira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ wer &apos;s arms to S@@ na@@ i@@ ppa , which indicates that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty in which Mozambique is faced : &quot;
&quot; I would like to ask GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , TH@@ IS is ashamed of land where people would be ashamed to spend sex against good notes , and other achievements , a country in which people would not hurt bread , a country in which the people would aim to get their bread , a country in which the people would aim to get their bread . &quot;
&quot; despite the sin@@ cer@@ ity of the phenomena , some of the opportunity for ma@@ wi@@ red humor could not miss . &quot;

&quot; a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , probably recently made . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be released as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of incar@@ cer@@ ated Chinese dis@@ sidents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has been standing attention in the international community after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June , that he has been hosp@@ itali@@ zed for cancer cancer in the final stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison due to &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state dangerous ) after being involved in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has been referred to as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; and a spokes@@ man tells you to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China still receives calls from the international community , Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , permit or give him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; hands R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu . &quot;
&quot; however , a speaker refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to enable Liu in foreign countries abroad . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway , when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded at Liu in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . in June , Norway had a agreement in order to re @-@ establish the nit@@ aries to China , since the exports have been mostly blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread out that Liu &apos;s seriously ill was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to a unconditional release , and invited Liu to take his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his detention , he was not able to oppos@@ e his prize . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was urged to liber@@ ate Liu and his wife immediately to free from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the EU , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , called for the release of Li@@ us as well as in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect that China lifts all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits , and receive them , and be able to communicate freely with the outer world . &quot;
United States
&quot; U.S. ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad reported that the Americans &apos; wish him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad , as long as it was granted to him in his satisfaction . &quot;
&quot; a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message to release the Chinese authorities to release the Chinese authorities , not only Liu &apos;s wife , but also to free his wife Ms. Liu X@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; the request of the US embassy attracted a fur@@ ious response from China after itself , with the outside of the Ministry of State that &quot; no country have the right to interv@@ ene and ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as travel route and access to medical care of its choice , to which they are entitled to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international comm@@ itments . &quot;
&quot; the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push out Liu and his wife unconditional release . &quot;
I encourage China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally that he can go into a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Liu &apos;s receives all the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns whether the vort@@ ex could be ha@@ dow by Liu the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on June 28 , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide an adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told AFP previously that Li@@ us wife , Liu X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu doesn &apos;t allow Liu to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old his international human rights issues , including freedom of expression , free and liber@@ ating the rights of these rights . &quot;
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons to release Liu from humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments , which he , regardless where , requires his wife and his family contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information that France would finally receive him . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the State matters in Taiwan called on 27 June to release Liu fre@@ eing and a greater tolerance to those who require peaceful resources to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u , from the ruling Democratic Party of China , urged China to handle the ill of intellectual Liu in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very concerned in an statement on June 28 by Liu and gave him that many asked to pray for Li@@ us Well@@ being . &quot;
he said about Liu :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives that he took and had been punished for that he had led to a harmon@@ ious , more stable and wealthy China , which would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally and encouraged me personally , as I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens insp@@ ires by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who stands for Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;

is Singapore a city or a country ?
&quot; the question may seem sil@@ ly , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state . &quot;
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be considered a town in Singapore .
this remark was triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting at the International branch of the State Association of New York , the minister said that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore as compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he is supporting that Singapore should be considered a city .
no one has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; that is , with most people a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to turn &quot; logic &quot; to defend the existing auth@@ orization of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable country , we hear that we are finally no country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the note of a flight before the responsibilities , a mandatory breach . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons stated by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of that , he appeared irre@@ voc@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , both cities that are permanent from a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as you reach the main point of the theme , the good old suffering from the author@@ itative mach@@ in@@ ers come up to be the first democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic as they fit better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , the answers to his American guests were given answers to our press , our ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system truly non @-@ answers . &quot;
related questions he bl@@ ended with non @-@ responses r@@ ational kind .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to illustr@@ ate his opinion because they didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
I personally think it &apos;s a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so is our city belongs to ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our advert@@ ised K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take on the effort to clarify this point when he was paid highly , in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the blog his comment posted a comment on the critics , that one should start to read the entire tran@@ script of the conference , in order to understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am better , according to which Singapore is a city or not a country . &quot;
read the script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; said that the elections in Singapore would be so un@@ acceptable , even if we are looking for free and righteous elections . &quot;
he was able to see Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am as leader of a her@@ ald @-@ growing generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de that awaits me - I agree with them or not but that &apos;s another matter .
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not sure whether he really believes it is true , and aware of what he is defended . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review de@@ compos@@ es the vulner@@ abilities of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
did Mr Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; ben@@ ign a mistake &quot; or was it a fri@@ ud@@ der loudspeaker ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are considered independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country the sovereign rights of the city went back to Singapore ? &quot;
Singapore is unique and it is equally country and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role in the cordless kettle , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of serious significance . &quot;
&quot; why are the people of Singapur of their military service , but defend their city only their city ? &quot;
who has to pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; as soon as the Journey of a Dec@@ ade , the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade , Singapore is always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence appears to have many of the people of Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defense of the country , especially , &quot; &quot; but that &apos;s not quite right . &quot;
we should talk rather from the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screenshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect about your residence or home country ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of a continuing series , with the rum@@ ours of certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is asked to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ?
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I reply . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation is the conversation , it is considered cour@@ te@@ ous to show interest in his conversation partners , making personal questions . &quot;
&quot; then the standard answer follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans do not cook inn@@ u@@ rous of anger , if they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t distur@@ b me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes between Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag visible at their back@@ pack if they are travelling .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
but Americans are ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the march in Iraq and September 11th . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always worn little map@@ le sheets on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gay mar@@ riages have been legal since 2005 legal !
to think about Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot;
Canada also applies to ethnic groups as the toler@@ ant country .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
firstly I have many American friends I ad@@ mi@@ red .
&quot; it would account for me , if you would like to change Johnny from Dallas , for example . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : as a &quot; kind , &quot; means to be sp@@ ared , as well as the good @-@ minded , gentle , but trag@@ ically , un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger # ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would have a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would be a step forward . but the actual problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that can be found . &quot;
harmless to be harmless and un@@ interesting and not to make any attention .
&quot; that can be something good , if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , fer@@ na@@ b of things that happen around . &quot;
&quot; I would even go as far as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a chief of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders above &quot; kind , &quot; is perhaps just cool polit@@ eness . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t talk about the fence along with the neighbors .
&quot; we are missing the warm heart@@ y , open kindness , which I connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has just been sexy . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ ded Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop band has published a music video , which took over the jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and restore the civilian government in 2014 , continues to rule over the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who told it , which prescri@@ bes his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video refers directly to the persist@@ ing military force of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other websites for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for song was a huge success .
&quot; in the first three days alone , it was shared on Facebook , uploaded Video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 lique@@ es . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists trained the public to watch this video . &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics as it is concerned with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
&quot; once again , check out these pictures of the videos that relate to some of the political topics that have been prosec@@ uted in Thailand over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may be referring to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provisional constitution , which is granted to the Commander in Chief of the He@@ eres absolute decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; integration of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered as a critic . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the Law on computing crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to susp@@ end activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army to monitors the online content and people accused of having de@@ fam@@ ed the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand puts a strict vocal against &quot; blasphem@@ es &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ ät@@ s@@ bel@@ i@@ bility ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a p@@ utsch of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to buy the Jun@@ ta , although security experts warned them that the purchase is un@@ necessarily and a waste of tax collectors . &quot;
&quot; in the video there is even shown how people are thrown into a black v@@ ans , before they bring them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in prison because they have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society , and Internet us@@ ks will have long prison terms , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Te@@ aser of the band showed members of the band , which made the Sal@@ ut of Pan@@ em , who had already been used by P@@ utsch opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the ghost cities in Eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the OC Media website and published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war company is re@@ covering only very slowly in East @-@ Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ slo@@ ch@@ as@@ ian war officially ended , but his sc@@ ars are still heavily visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , defense , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in the territory . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians and aby@@ ss@@ es live in the area . &quot;
these settlements are also called Gei@@ ster@@ asia in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today , there are only a few hundred people in these ghost cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for t@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16,000 people after having barely increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , approximately 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a result of the war , &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey building blocks from the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ co@@ w@@ kas , are symbo@@ lically for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are fallen and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot;
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all served in the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable spl@@ endor @-@ buildings .
&quot; the people who once lived in this place and had their contribution to the Central Planning economy of the Soviet Union , have now left the district . &quot;
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ow@@ lands , which still accommodate one or two families , one recogni@@ zes the balconies where clothes are dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover the camera in his hand , they immediately withdraw . &quot;
&quot; our mother prohibited us that we let us take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she just forbidden it , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers of her girlfriend something and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and van@@ ish .
many people work in the area for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of scenic products for the property requirements ) , such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable . &quot;
it is difficult to come about the laps .
&quot; in winter , the district administration supplies candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini &quot;
&quot; ten years ago , an older woman was named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as they are called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left to leave Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept any financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she has supported her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are we visit us .
&quot; but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with its own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya to her . &quot; they said , we could build cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot;
I already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; you can get to everything , &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ asha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds of the village of the war .
&quot; despite the relatives who live in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia simply broke out ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but that will last something , &quot; explains it . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 child money for every child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten once was found , they hold pigs , cows , ha@@ iling and h@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; she tells that there was a very frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village . &quot;
&quot; but in the course of time , she lost their fears . &quot;

&quot; we don &apos;t worry about the dark road or the few people .
you can get to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it rather has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; after the war , there was hardly work and everyone who lived it was right . &quot;
I remember every day as the city and the war once were .
&quot; as our conversation passed by the end , a small boy is passing by us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hiding .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him back .
he plays with the ball , then rolling the hill . &quot;
&quot; a group of children , now write the ball . &quot;
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the falling buildings . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood who care for in@@ descri@@ b@@ ness in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; lives on their long journey &quot;

&quot; on the path of migrants attemp@@ ting to cross Europe or Latin America , certain places for their hospitality are known . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tap@@ ach@@ ula . he is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
&quot; it is directed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican , a small woman with a cor@@ ding pink bre@@ wer frame and gold colored earrings in ted@@ dy bear form . &quot;
&quot; she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather she ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on transit .
the hotel has rather no charm .
&quot; for approximately 2,50 Dollar the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , br@@ illed walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - still hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez told us that people are coming into full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; mom Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
&quot; at present it is rather quiet , but in this year Ram@@ í@@ rez had already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
there are only 24 rooms but some have already slept on boxes .
she wants to refuse .
&quot; she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they are buying them medication that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m that are exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived at a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a jog@@ hur@@ t@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hoping to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cks .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; I really feel it suits her , as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao is traveling with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and her three children .
&quot; they have lived already in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had owned by other tracks from Mama Africa . &quot; m@@ um Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
&quot; he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ kan@@ ers often go together the track and that the Afri@@ cans speak already on What@@ s@@ App of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; like many of his companion , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey into the United States . &quot;
&quot; for months , he has been a guest at Mama Africa : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus to Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I wonder if he is contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; he answers sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez told that her guests are often sending text messages when they are gone to gr@@ ate them or to report about the course of their journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spar@@ king hope for migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a sc@@ ou@@ g@@ asse leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valencia and his family stayed in her small house . &quot;
he is polic@@ eman and has found that Bust@@ ick@@ ets sold to numerous African migrants too expensive .
&quot; he began to help them to receive a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar one dollar . &quot;
&quot; at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ an . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking site outside . &quot;
Valen@@ cian explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled after a raid on his work in the United States after a raid on his work . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents , also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to press money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for a accommodation and an unknown , an All@@ ergy , has offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family stays still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again .
&quot; in the gears , trav@@ ellers consult their phones quietly . &quot;
&quot; a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away . &quot;
as a proud Grand@@ mother bare her in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair fol@@ ks that you made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and elderly . &quot;
&quot; she laughs sad , while she briefly introduces her . &quot;
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; she repeated every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ in@@ jiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check @-@ Point for personal communication equipment in X@@ in@@ ang from Twitter users , users &quot;
&quot; the residents of X@@ in@@ jiang , an ethnic minority interests in Western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July , the mobile phone users received a mobile notification in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi a mobile notification made to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the release , the app is said to have access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities blocked the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had replaced the app messages with a private sage group . &quot;
&quot; in the release of the police that the app would determine the sources and distribution routes of terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , Trojan and Ph@@ ishing pages to make user attention to how much time they spend online , and remote control its own home network . &quot;
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; of course , an app with these functions can be used in various ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; Remote Commander &quot; could potentially manipul@@ ate the home network or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal it . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while noti@@ fications of digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China most often focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant , oppressed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ in@@ jiang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme ti@@ dings and surveillance measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ ely internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; based on Twitter based media out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; A@@ liz@@ ards &quot; &quot; ) , the cen@@ sored news in China released , showed photos of a chec@@ kl@@ ist , where police in@@ discri@@ min@@ ate the residents , whether they installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ in@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected on a Check@@ point with a device without these software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; they have forced the people to use devices , which are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of captivity by the rest of the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; e &apos;@@ ies &quot; &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ product description , from which the software can lift the knowledge requirement of a Windows operating system , thus making un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard disk . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones are used in X@@ in@@ jiang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may have a reaction to the instructions of the City party Council to minim@@ ize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all government branches , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office at operation of their computer and communication equipment . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned this new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ in@@ jiang the authorities released on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable disks , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible compar@@ isons , such as those who refer to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the number of sleep or death , in which activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane finds his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and make sure you are alone at a place in which everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has to be revealed after and after , and a truth revealed clearly , both inside and from outside . &quot;
one who makes her name every honour .
&quot; one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions , which allow no met@@ aph@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; but when looking back the reality , you look behind the scenes , beyond the theater , the beautiful scenes and the performer - turn the characters in essence of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt det@@ ach themselves in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is caught on the axis of the monster . you will clear that you are caught between walls and your grand@@ parents , stone for stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that &apos;s not yet enough to make my lesson , so that I was form@@ ulated with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
&quot; he set his power over us , as he even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew . &quot;
five young people were torn during a peaceful protests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was enough to break the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all the quarters were cov@@ eted , but my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was silent , mot@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I have no high demands to a city that is up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; during the third night , things have been so@@ othing something , after the power supply stopped in the quarter . &quot;
I broke the silence by playing several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I listened to my voice through the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt cour@@ ageous enough to collabor@@ ate together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends closed to me ; we are taking us to a splendid picture , filled my expectations fully and completely fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you are free the Spirit from the lamp , but it simply don &apos;t interests you in the barley . &quot;
I received a call from my father : &quot; do you ready to meet us at the military safety building . &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low down - nothing can return to you , after you have pushed all the way up to the office of security from the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I was now . &quot;
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to talk : &quot; let me hear how you can hear &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you &apos;re only cour@@ ageous enough to scre@@ am , if we are not near . &quot;
his eyes fulfilled her eyes on me .
&quot; and you dream of what , look to me in the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fool@@ is@@ hness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my job as I answered : &quot; I haven &apos;t thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped to watch you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such dis@@ astro@@ us consequences for me , and yet I regret not regret one word from what I said . &quot;
&quot; he is in sol@@ itary and his father , with it . &quot;
&quot; his father is like this . &quot;
the fl@@ ank of this curse is far from me until today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture that was exposed to months . &quot;
I sc@@ r@@ assed the farm .
&quot; in the first office , I leave everything I bear with me . &quot;
&quot; after that , through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a motion to the individual cells . &quot;
I appreciate all the details exactly before I care the room .
&quot; otherwise , they probably have assigned a greater cell to me this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one another prisoner , and may immediately put me immediately , without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I returned to an old @-@ proven communication method : to beat the fist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell en@@ ra@@ de was a &quot; Er@@ sth@@ ä@@ ft@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after long hes@@ it@@ ators , he answered me . &quot;
&quot; apparently there was none of the surrounding cells a prestigious man in the middle age , which is similar to me and &quot; doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , no distinctive facial features can be seen in me , and doctors are not available here ; we are all the numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to me ? &quot;
all answers connected its existence .
perhaps he was transferred into one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would be pleased to leave him if I stay . &quot;
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
&quot; I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to distribute all these cro@@ ws , who have l@@ acked the fruits of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; still . &quot;
&quot; it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black the color of corruption is until I saw the yellow light , which presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ unders , &quot; playing on the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
&quot; they are here , to be heard . &quot;
&quot; it was the secret to protect the state of state in front of us and prevent the terrorists and terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wit@@ ian dial@@ ect - so they played their denomin@@ ational creation card and made the tight view of view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , here is no country ; it is a curse which they call co@@ existence to transform their cl@@ ans into a mighty hero . &quot;
&quot; I cared for the hearing , and meet Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; he cap@@ tures a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that escaped him : &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can join this t@@ age@@ di@@ ly and protest against demonstrations , which will soon be found in an end . &quot;
I didn &apos;t reply .
I have used it to answer .
I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes after a friendly discussion for me to become a normal communication tool .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to be punished , punished , even though I had done nothing to make this sentence . &quot;
to be a penalty in all of its diversity .
&quot; his command is to tear me as much as possible from the body , as possible . &quot;
he calls the loving &quot; confession &quot; . &quot;
&quot; it begins with a plastic pipe , probably from the clo@@ ak . &quot;
your h@@ ker gro@@ ans to your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you can not measure you with him , and you can &apos;t hold your scre@@ ams . &quot;
my scre@@ ams were still not enough : why they inter@@ changeable the pipe by a cable .
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had flo@@ cked four cables in each other to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour , three of them changed , while I still lived in the series . &quot;
I had lost every feeling in my body - and my voice is why I heard up cry out .
&quot; the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling down and didn &apos;t find a favor , why he is the next to a electrically charged staff . &quot;
&quot; electricity passes my whole body , enough to supply my whole quarter . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
&quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night . &quot;
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep myself again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours passed , which came to me as minutes . &quot;
then call the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I reply with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; my lord , my father has to worry fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk away , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ on H@@ da@@ ib speaks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community . free expression of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib rough a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sl@@ oth@@ es to his screen , sometimes on his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; what you can rely on , is a cigarette between his fingers or his nic@@ ot@@ ine lips to discover . &quot;
he lives in the highest bul@@ let of his family house which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank and had lived in Palestine from their village in Palestine in which she lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmer ) .
&quot; since now , H@@ da@@ ib has been a passionate activist , the conservative majority transferred to the conservative majority of gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression through art and rap@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; with his music that often deals with topics such as Orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of the whole Arab world , he also urges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only finding out in his home town of Amman , but also in cities committed by Damascus in Yemen until the whole of San@@ aa . &quot;
&quot; at his 25 years , H@@ da@@ ib sees himself as someone who is not affected by boundaries in his mind , and he can participate in his own statement with people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if it is not open to the US foreign policy , he swe@@ eping against the US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ ib considers his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , something with his identity was born as &quot; Palestinian ge@@ aring of the second generation &quot; - so he himself was born in Jordan and never before Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own living circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ ib . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so because I &apos;m a man , while he sho@@ ok in water . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; at that time it is intended for Muslims to fa@@ sten from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ ib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee is little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; in general , the sle@@ dge of the warm coffee and the cock@@ ro@@ ar of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose are primarily associated with freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially when one throws a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one avo@@ ids it easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to land not in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has cancelled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; a few Parliament ordered that support the Islamic branch &apos;s front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the country , Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert chart . &quot;
the MPs and former press @-@ spokes@@ woman of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert was &quot; straight &quot; due to the sexual orientation of the singers .
&quot; in addition , many claim that the involvement of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is a dangerous acti@@ vism that represents the established legitim@@ acy author@@ itarian regim@@ es throughout the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to use themselves &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is probably not easy to be a shallow rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually , a clear@@ er @-@ cryst@@ alline reality is reflected in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs work clearly . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib came back to traditional gender standards that made his vision of the fate of Arabic women that have vo@@ wed sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a manifest @-@ lighted unknown woman , whose arms and legs are stretching up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red sea , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who should have confidence . &quot;
&quot; over the past years , Jordan has increased the number of &quot; Hon@@ our mor@@ de &quot; - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , Jordan was still lacking to support the institutional infrastructure to support women who tried to support murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on frag@@ ile violence in 1954 , women who are subjected to the risk of intern@@ alised violence in prison , and for their release is often necessary for a year long bureaucr@@ atic expend@@ itu@@ res and the guarantee of the family that the woman will not happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music also enjoys great popularity and is known for it , even to back on topics , which are long known as tab@@ u in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib asser@@ ts that his work is politically , but dreamed that he is his music that is full of explic@@ it stories on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; he was buried in politics , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ ib takes the question of Palestinian identity in an attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; is the focus on poverty .
&quot; the list of songs that are politically politically , can continue . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ ib published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse is often repeated : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and any other is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind of market , in which you can , in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - is faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gene@@ ity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he not@@ ices that hardly anyone in Jordan was talking about the rights of gay and les@@ bian , and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cen@@ sored in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib introduced an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ Program Ro@@ ya , in order to notice that his comments were torn from the context , twi@@ sted and cen@@ sored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but only one worked version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ ib is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he menti@@ ons Abu Nu@@ a , a poet of the eighth century , which still remained in memory today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib is asking himself : if Abu Nu@@ a , who was later to work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , in the eighth century could write openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians be this ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ ib , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian Kingdom , there is nothing new anymore that the government attacks the free expression of expression and that progressive votes will be added to silence . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Agency took several former government officials and members of the teacher , with the reas@@ oning that they would be related to comments in social media , which coinci@@ des with the deep in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of what is the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs , only the top of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians . &quot;
&quot; for him , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila returned to the second time in a row but the way of progress - this is that H@@ da@@ ib - consists of slow , thought and inner changes . it is certain that these changes took place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian Society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ ib dre@@ amt , like millions of other Arabs , also from an Arab world without interventions abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dreams about his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is characterized by music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental op@@ enn@@ ess - and not by bombs , spreading un@@ itions and artificial art . at least , he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; so far as far as far as far as far as it is , H@@ da@@ ib will continue to resist . &quot;
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting as a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these great , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one assumes that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory states that the trucks , the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years were invaded , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to the knee . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
&quot; one can imagine only difficult , how large these parts are ... &quot;
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have a look at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again : two festive cars are straight to see .
&quot; nonetheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only tru@@ e - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the North of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre high fixed car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of summer !

&quot; rarely , external appar@@ ition and body care were so important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitim@@ ate profession like the hair@@ e@@ urs . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where traffic noise and illegal drugs trade are daily . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - increasing demand for men &apos;s aesthetic services . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers who can form this complex hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the ultimate limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
there are experts on each other to show who can create the ec@@ cent@@ ric L@@ ooks as you can see in the following video ( more videos for current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to share their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice to get an apprentices@@ hip in hair@@ dres@@ s@@ art , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and offering great opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can seize a profession that is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school offered special training workshops in March of the school year and reported some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only technical school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because of love to the children we have built this education community . &quot;
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters
photograph : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the working version of the Beit@@ er &apos;s Message for gu@@ err@@ illa fighters that published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who stum@@ bled to counter@@ ing aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; this question was the two young Colom@@ bian activist Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Young Youth Foundation , inspired by the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , inspired by the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to write young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa letters . &quot;
&quot; recently , her country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces Colombia ) , which forms the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; international was considered as important for the signature of the peace agreement as significant , that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Colombia , it is still a long way , until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who lived for many years in illegal stocks , were exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ oric , and around the clock their weapons was carried out into the life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases profound hatred opposite gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , have to support them in their rows and support them in construction of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colombia would have to close together and assist with integration process .
and exactly this did they : until now they have written thousands of young people letters - lovers of former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them again in the company .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters which will then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates that was held in Bog@@ ot@@ á in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
&quot; this declared that we love the people , which we love to write thousands of love letters , but those who forget it much more necessary . &quot;
&quot; he plan , he continued to share his love with people in this year , needed . &quot;
&quot; thus , the plan to write letters filled with hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC which now find their place in society and create a new life to make the dis@@ course from a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2000 letters were collected in the framework of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I never thought that someone would be forgiven
the first 500 letters were handed over in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipal authorities of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled to the camp to personally put the letters personally . &quot;
members of the F@@ ARC presented themselves as they had done earlier in order to oppos@@ e the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of sub@@ jection of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is between &quot; , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Governor of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we had handed over the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , where gu@@ err@@ illa lives ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go away , because next to him there was a M@@ GL pomegran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in a thorn . &quot;
&quot; and I said to him , &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing now ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I reply to a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never before me in my life , someone wrote something so nice , that &apos;s why I reply to it . suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I firmly embra@@ ced him and put me beside the pomegran@@ ate .
&quot; perhaps he was too sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all those years of faithful companions of this fighting , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life as a war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to store him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would give me my mistake .
&quot; but now , I know that there is a society outside there , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
until now I have learned how I have to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace is prev@@ ailing , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the opening ceremony , students and some leader of the F@@ ARC came together for a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already existed in secret .
&quot; this is why the leader of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how the social in@@ justice worked on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a destination of these magn@@ itude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; those people have never heard that had yet never found hearing , and to recognize that the people who I have seen as monsters and even hate people who were surrounded by their living circumstances and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does hurt me . &quot;
&quot; but he comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused many harm to give us something , and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
&quot; the Colombia was made , that after the dis@@ armament of peace would rule peace . &quot;
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to rise up and to protest against their rights , and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter which breed , religion or ide@@ ology they hear - to rise over all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and offer sacrifices , because we know from its own experience that nothing is simple . let those amongst us who defend life as foundation of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ min@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Caucas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and discretion . &quot;
&quot; with fear , activists have witnessed the coverage of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that depends on the LGB@@ T@@ Q community about the dor@@ m LGB@@ T@@ Q community is not until night .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us , and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago , following reports which the dis@@ car@@ ing , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic of them@@ at@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gaz@@ eta , and she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , the susp@@ icious que@@ er men and they put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; have brought a monster to the world , &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a trans@@ gression , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and grew up there . &quot;
she felt a woman since her childhood .
&quot; when she was grown up , you became aware that Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after having experienced a group of Che@@ chens from the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sabrina was opened . &quot;
&quot; from fear to their lives , they moved the final end to the US . &quot;
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ gression that was stuck into trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help you , someone , from whom I thought , he would be a friend , a copy of my documents , and spread them everywhere in the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . so there are no men more in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya who can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos taken from my documents by all the What@@ s@@ App round . &quot;
&quot; on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was right there was a couple of shopping in my car &apos;s back seat , I heard a male child : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya : &quot; how long will you honour the family yet , you ins@@ ult ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
I know only that there was a young man there was no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and aw@@ aking up the last end of the hospital .
apparently some women had received everything and started scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two j@@ ig@@ old in my right lung wings . &quot;
OC Media : what the wings were they laid - in whom the men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name ; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women . &quot;
I am very grateful to him .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it to do with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Caucas@@ ian name . &quot;
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they call me , wrote me - Rel@@ ated , strangers and some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; the desired , send me back to Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they presented absur@@ dity recei@@ v@@ ables : some told me , I have to prove it by the road without through the streets ; others wanted me to change my sex in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and that I had not changed my sex , that everything was only bad , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what should I say in television ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some older people said once my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , that not only your family , but the whole republic is ashamed . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she put a stri@@ ck around the neck .
&quot; fortunately , the neighbours came and saved them . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
&quot; I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window there was a car with dar@@ ken@@ ed window and a number plate with one 95 . &quot;
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it was clear to me that something was la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights friends tested the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help , I left the country , but then something un@@ credible . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
&quot; just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought it without , without identification , without identification . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the tr@@ ash .
came and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a strange woman .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you are going in safety , just because you have forsaken the country ? &quot;
people know you know in which hotel you stand . you even know your room number .
only about it to prove to you : it &apos;s the number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
this actually was my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality . &quot;
some traditional Caucas@@ ian elements I still bear in myself .
&quot; so much as I wish , this se@@ el@@ ic barrier may not be overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; in fact , if we chat with camera , I give myself trouble as the person remembers , that she reminds of her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
&quot; for this , I needed more information about the situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
I talked with someone who had dinner one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an was not arrested and tortured , but also that all the Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait until the end of the Ram@@ ad@@ an could not wait . &quot;
most likely they are now focused on family and relatives .
&quot; that I mean , they probably invite their relatives , who take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced by blood . &quot;
OC Media : will men now have gay men detained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
&quot; Sabrina : a friend of mine says , that &apos;s not very many . &quot;
&quot; if , especially those who have no rich relatives or have dropped from their relatives to present the Kad@@ y@@ &apos;s court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there , so that they can be present later than terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people had not simply disappeared , but specifically sub@@ merged to radic@@ alise . &quot;
OC Media : is this only a guess or have you a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard had grown .
&quot; since then , there was nothing new from them . &quot;
they simply took them away .
&quot; this so @-@ called Lord , this person was involved , when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , they were not presented as band@@ its , but there were no reports so far . we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why else could it not allow this man to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these persecutions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who were living in a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , which took place in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think before 2003 , I was already familiar with a great deal , when I lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia initially wanted to lead us to the &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vili@@ zation &quot; &quot; but eventually came back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were p@@ umped ; I had colored eyelashes , wore tube je@@ ans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Security of the Sh@@ aria has not only curved me a hair .
&quot; before the Russian Theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks were standing , and all the city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a language requirement : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; mo@@ ck is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
&quot; they often say to children , when they are fun about sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they simply shut up their eyes from you , because they believed , you are sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they never ins@@ ulting me , never hun@@ ted , and never sm@@ itten me . &quot;
OC Media : how long kept this grace time ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row appeared on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ ality in television . &quot;
&quot; he did not say about us , but above the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless - it could sense , as people began in the city to change . &quot;
&quot; who previously claimed and laughed , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot;
in the time I left Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the republic is constantly wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I &apos;m working as a wa@@ iter .
I won &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the United States .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as a activist activist . &quot;
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I agree with them as a kind psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we perfectly organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , past@@ ures , I invite them to hospital and help them to get medical cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t leave for a p@@ enny .
I discovered these people themselves when I cli@@ cked out .
I am Muslim . I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ um@@ ber .
&quot; so , nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Che@@ chens that w@@ ishing you with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no tails with them . &quot;
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the cab@@ aret which Russians have also known ; on the whole planet it is - but &quot; not in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s un@@ pleasant to hear what to hear . &quot;
I meet here as many men from the Caucas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims that go into the mosque and during the Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think of transp@@ os@@ ity to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experience . but that &apos;s a tru@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different species of emotion to be exact , different living settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body . &quot;
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I will personally get here personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not so sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warned against an increase of suicide in the poor Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; for the last months , there has been a strong increase of suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the South West of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under Ang@@ st@@ ats , depression , and he was ashamed for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that would come to life as Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups that would like to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anonymous . &quot;
&quot; on YouTube , a video held the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself . &quot;
&quot; some people made it fast to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ ulation hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the combustion were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only one committed suicide in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists warned that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hung up . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing in common : there were all family members who felt themselves because of persecution on Iranian government , hel@@ pless and unable to pursue their families and pursue a safe job . &quot;
&quot; Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult to take their lives in the local Arab population . &quot;
&quot; one century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was an autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and became great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran such as oil and gas fields as well as some of the most influential and most valuable areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , regional economy is still developing slowly , and the native population gets only little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; they are often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and ab@@ ili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime ref@@ uses Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arab@@ ians systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a multitude of d@@ men , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom are located . &quot;
these d@@ storms have led only to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region caused by dr@@ y@@ ness and destroy the local agriculture as well as fish and pal@@ ms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ Hawai@@ ian boys now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian director for cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is that seek a work , completed the primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activist with residence in London , Global Vo@@ ices declared that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic origin , and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot;
&quot; as officials and institutions do not prefer@@ ring the labour force , the local Arabic Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to business opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to anni@@ hil@@ ate the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and to force them to earn their lives outside of their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to hide their pre@@ - and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arabian names will not be toler@@ ated , because the speech of the Arabic language or the Arabic clothes are not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in view of the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i must endure , human rights activists strike out alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot;
&quot; it remains to wait , whether the world wake up and know of it . &quot;
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avo@@ id@@ able .

&quot; why I do not uni@@ denti@@ fied myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot;
&quot; detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License . &quot;
&quot; the following article is an revised version of the comments published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i , and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions were expressed . &quot;
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who refer to themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fr@@ ust . &quot;
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , that women still earn less money in spite of the same education . &quot;
&quot; if women are still under str@@ ingent observation , if therefore , what they are allowed to do with her body . &quot;
violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social nor@@ ms are still ensuring that women sooner or later , in various areas of life to a gl@@ itter@@ ing blanket , and that discrimination are still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is conscious and well @-@ known .
I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : if I come to skin color , rac@@ ism , on black C@@ is @-@ women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ IQ community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I promise , as we have always been suffering physically , se@@ el@@ ic and verb@@ al , many white femin@@ ists were silent and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; yet , however , all agree that women - all women - come together to sing &quot; their voices , and &quot; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord , &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , an institutional form of r@@ assi@@ fying violence gives up black women to two times . &quot;
&quot; or beyond that , black women and women may earn less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls with migration background often rejected the school as a white girl , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black mo@@ ve@@ ars and women with a migration background are subjected to higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all the women , all men and all men , neither any skin colour that have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot take into consideration as a black woman who ref@@ uses to take into consideration the white woman who ref@@ uses to face both sex as well as the skin colour of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and I will not fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere , who always and countless others black women always rejected . &quot;
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in 1851 in their speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain a ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ g@@ inal being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , in order to drive their eg@@ o@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to put white women the importance of over@@ cutting skin colour and gender . because some of them will continue to be silent for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women with different origin and grow from white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself full of femin@@ ism and to set me the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , who was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m , that is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we define black women looking forward to our own ideas and take us into the shareholders , which are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , in which we can also defend ourselves in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be ad@@ mi@@ red that make the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call themselves separ@@ ati@@ ism and exclusion after these lines have read , I pray you about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a bl@@ ur@@ istic environment , I can ass@@ ert black women and women of other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m I exist . &quot;
&quot; because of my dark skin , I recognized as part of this paradise as part of this para@@ dig@@ m . &quot;
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life is neither over@@ taken , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;

&quot; in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his church . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of tur@@ ally . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ g@@ oll@@ us@@ bin ) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected people .
&quot; a police officer said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she was nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who has become violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship there was a little time , and the police said that their testimony would be laid to the files , but they could not do . &quot;
&quot; when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed because of abuse , the ak@@ h display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did not use anything . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second wife with@@ drew its display . &quot;
the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women had any display , they do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men who abuse them . this explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all in the prosec@@ utions authorities . &quot;
&quot; In@@ scri@@ 1 stro@@ kes and Statist@@ ic en@@ 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ uses and a legal system that doesn &apos;t sub@@ merge sub@@ t@@ 3 of the laws : good approach , fl@@ a@@ wed implementation of stro@@ kes and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to see how many women are really har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at Centro de Document@@ ay y E@@ studios , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that have not even an@@ dest@@ in@@ ise the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; explains them . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures are al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were 9@@ 600 ads due to domestic violence . 70 % of them went violence against women . &quot;
86 % of ads on the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence in peace . here , 86 % of the ads came from women . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women say that they were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen woman minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only few of these off@@ ences are actually indicated . &quot; on each woman who will not be ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women will not do this . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2014 , two women who do not do this because of physical abuse , will come to the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since the murder of women in Paraguay cannot be a criminal off@@ ence , the prosecution authorities could not adequ@@ ately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; alone until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women in the country . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases , in which women were murdered by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence . &quot;

invisible fail@@ ures and a legal system that doesn &apos;t under@@ take anything
&quot; before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the solid friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do this , but then she was going to regret it . &quot;
&quot; today , Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos . but for two years she carried the psych@@ ic violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ zable : &quot;
I have never thought that I would become a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read it about it , I thought that the only women happened to be sub@@ jug@@ ated , because they are fool@@ ed by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mariana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ oric , whether he ever had the hand against them , refused to en@@ roll that his behavior was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mariana , why they had fallen so long from Carlos and left him not earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost like that , as they wanted to say that victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ uses had at least some complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Victoria Santos , who was not from Paraguay , fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner she har@@ assed her . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group they can speak with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
&quot; finally , her wealthy partners managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he started to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as ads added to the authorities without a result and also from their relatives . she received no support .
&quot; it led a process against their former partner who developed into a non @-@ thou@@ ght@@ ful jur@@ ist struggle between Paraguay and its home country , in which it mainly went to money , power , and influence of their former partner . &quot;
&quot; laws laws : good approach , lacking implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of missions is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; said Victoria Santos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems with the use of the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ E@@ lla ( # Princ@@ ely ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ ref@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; the original design of the law en@@ vis@@ aged Fem@@ izi@@ d to explain to an independent criminal off@@ ence and tou@@ g@@ her how it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; thus , the legisl@@ ature has changed in some points to win the dep@@ uties for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions must be banned in Paraguay and pun@@ ish@@ able by up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had fore@@ seen , most of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) process cost that the victims of violence currently have to bear , if they simply wish to receive the state and receive a safe accommodation to the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature is no sufficient financial resources available :
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of human relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , there must be a re@@ thinking , that violence is not considered to be considered a bit . &quot;
&quot; in view of these facts , he is found guilty and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators are gone . &quot;
we have to restore so long display until abuse are no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed . among other things , a passage of the law had been canc@@ eled to reconc@@ ile the partners in cases of domestic violence . &quot;
opinions of the changes go apart .
&quot; the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ gres@@ sor , to attack his victim again . &quot;
&quot; the string of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great decline . &quot;

most names were changed to protect the affected people .
&quot; in Oman , independent media in Oman had continued to ban a newspaper in attacks &quot;
&quot; this website was locked due to a decision of the information Minister , on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the British authorities have closed the independent Arab newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served a one @-@ year sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Za@@ her Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court , but later returned . &quot;
&quot; Oman has re@@ igns in Oman by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said , who came to power after he had buried his father , Said i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state of state . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the Sult@@ ans is characterized by the temporary efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic secret service , public liberties , including press freedom , inter@@ rog@@ ation and human rights defended , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities viol@@ ate peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , even activists , in order to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions online as well as offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its cl@@ amping and the prison three of her editors last year is a hard blow for the freedom of press in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , who has been reported in Oman at Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) since its inc@@ eption in 2007 , until they were banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , announced that in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 , an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties bound hands of Justice &quot; was published . there was corruption in judicial authorities and the mixture of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance . &quot;
&quot; issue of the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , 26 July 2016 , with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bound hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Za@@ her Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Board Committee , was charged before the special department and was arrested by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the deputy chief editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who moved to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is Fest@@ ing as Chief Editor . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed at irregular time after the information minister had given the assignment that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 is forbidden . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i trial . &quot;
the court sentenced the three Journ@@ alists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both sentenced to mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; excav@@ ation of the State of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violations of the association &apos;s ban and sl@@ ander guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year detention sentences and pen@@ alties in the amount of 3000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition a single @-@ year prohibition against the two journalists was hanged .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year of jail and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after spending the use of an information network for the distribution of material that could be found guilty of public order .
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i was set up a security deposit of 5000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) , and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appeals Court acquitted Al @-@ Abr@@ i &apos;s appeal on 26 December 2016 , but Al Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after completing his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he served his sentence in jail .
the Appeals Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper sees itself exposed to attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Information Minister also dismissed a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister personally signed a further instruction in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , bringing the Minister for another time against the decision of the Appeals Court , announced the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the constant closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman in recent times the press of press was injured .
&quot; for further injuries , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ wat@@ in and the exercising of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to put their operations . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the media freedom of press freedom . &quot;
the Golf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j promp@@ tly release and unconditional release ;
&quot; 2 . create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their job ; &quot;
&quot; 3 . to protect the press freedom in the country , and &quot;
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances , human rights defence and journalists in Oman will im@@ pose their righ@@ t@@ ful human rights work and without fear , including judicial barriers , can be pract@@ ised . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Figure takes place with his agreement &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely seen or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses the urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need on @-@ site medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack of global health services , many medicines and vacc@@ ines which cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have a major problem in the poorest countries of Africa &apos;s poorest countries , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research that is carried out by African scientists themselves in establishing its own research capacity in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is the director of the Centre for the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research , Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic was first engraved on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Sam@@ bia for a study in the United States , first in Louisiana , later in Indiana . &quot;
&quot; as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he studied at the HIV @-@ virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media on these research . &quot;
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private owner ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests . &quot;
I also launch a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens . &quot;
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important scientific topics in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research . we only rely on solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers instead of being mo@@ vers instead . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get , are often un@@ suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here . &quot;
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
projects are well supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to return or go , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work which you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have continuous supply of electricity , water and Internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it lasts months to import from other countries . &quot;
g@@ v : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; g@@ v : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they concentrate , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age classes .
&quot; demand for special scientific training , starting in every age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of the space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa from western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often , they are limited to do things to do things , and experience access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and speed of research . &quot;
from the United States to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine which reports solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ths , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA &apos;s ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only produced by its own in@@ fest@@ ation and the question how many salads you can get limits . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them . &quot;
&quot; patents are not only for individual varieties but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special rot@@ or or green leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the last years , more of such patents have been registered for more plants such as grain or cart@@ ons . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts have been ensuring food security in the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on is still a salad , but needs more than always longer , since his work is becoming increasingly difficult due to its work . &quot;
&quot; it is , when I would lie in a river a b@@ oul@@ ders , around which I have to p@@ umping . &quot;
&quot; so we must do this now , but it is a break with the breed tradition , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; I think this patents go too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they withstand judgment , no one can breed any more than new salads , because all features are already patented . &quot; he makes as good as possible and tries to breeding those characteristics that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ving to use no material protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have been bred and eaten red Rö@@ mer@@ s@@ ate in the greenhouse . there is being tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name might sound as sounds , then the movement from the IT area should come and not from the field of plant breeding . &quot;
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
&quot; it was set up in life to ensure that some plant species and species are not protected as intellectual property , and for plant bre@@ eders permanently usable . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , U.S. bre@@ eder can be mandatory that others can use seeds from them far@@ med seed freely . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they can not do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow only others to breed their seed , it can be crossed in order to breed as own sorts - two aspects that are forbidden by many plant pat@@ ents . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for emer@@ itus Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed , and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to seed , seeds plays a role in major merge such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would attempt to breed the latter not or only little to use with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open source &quot; movement doesn &apos;t work with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . to buy our goal of ecological agriculture , it also says that the way is being offered to farmers in August and September 2016 , should also know that the way that this vegetables is cultivated , is threatened . &quot;
nutrition sovereign is not possible without seed sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to provide other seed companies in order to provide access to other seeds , as opposed to it , seed and plant features . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argu@@ ed that the future of food supplies are at risk , as the available genetic means due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights on the plant material which is therefore always restricted . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , CEO Director of O@@ ss@@ i , engaged in her doctoral thesis with gen@@ etic variation on carrots and their availability . it found out that about a third of all cart@@ on features are protected as intellectual property , which is either impossible for plant bre@@ eders either . &quot;
&quot; there are no estimates for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggests that mass@@ inn@@ ate plants like wheat in even larger style are patented as a salad or carrots . &quot;
a Question of Vis@@ ions
plants are so far@@ med that they feature targeted characteristics - of such as their flavor or their color improved to such as they thri@@ ve in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
&quot; patents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is decreasing due to increasingly more patents . genetic diversity is currently unnecessary than ever since the changed conditions are worse than ever before climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to believes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four geni@@ uses and cooperation with institutions such as the Federal Ministry of Agriculture in the United States , the company established itself for maintaining the genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property comprises other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant di@@ ets innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expired . &quot;
&quot; often , these instructions often help others to come to the same result . &quot;
&quot; so , innovation does not in@@ hib@@ its innovations , but encour@@ ages them to be provided by public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees that differently : 20 years to wait until a patent of patent , there are certainly no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long on plants to breed plants , which are adapted to the changed environment conditions , one would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources always have been a general good and it should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ aries inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; it is what drives us , and it is impossible to us if we continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es on the concept to patented plant features : &quot; we do not create the characteristics . &quot;
&quot; the plants form themselves out and as bre@@ eders , we have no idea how the plants do it . &quot;
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; in the U.S. state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety , breeding his own values into it . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation may be used her@@ b@@ icide , bre@@ wed in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is accurate . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than such as Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject it or hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eders Frank Mort@@ on is looking for in his breeding garden salad .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; Mort@@ on is also the opinion that Bre@@ eders is highly innovative by preventing plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like that , with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that are pat@@ enting . &quot;
&quot; I need a new material for my catalog , since I know my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years itself , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , with what you can easily make it quite nicely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the USA seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept spreads rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as professional organization in the field of resources , the centre with farmers working together and helps them to breed new varieties to breed certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports it to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organization Agre@@ co@@ l works in an Open Source License , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding ) differ from land to land , due to the O@@ ss@@ i commitment not simply being taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventi@@ onally bred plants should not be patented . thus , they are permitted to fight against the current practice of the European Patent . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not a law yet ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch Organisation H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives from all East Africa to experience something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and global trend towards crops of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos;s program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems explains that the organization is currently being a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for the scheduled next year of the official starting signal . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to plant and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Ess@@ ens - an Verb@@ und from aux@@ iliary organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - have to contribute to seeds and improve the seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food . &quot;
&quot; in this report , the importance of a diverse , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems are emphas@@ ized - a connection between the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that soon more people will recognize him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has been specially cultivated , where and how little is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we try now to make human beings that even more behind her food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ locking the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend around the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government issued the website of the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information &quot; ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network released a statement on Facebook , in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Network for Human Rights Information lead &quot; &quot; despite this attack and the potential of the Egyptian right and the constitution of the authorities to defend this goals , even though it was never so difficult to overcome this goals , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all technical possibilities were to overcome , and not to admit that our task will continue to meet our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jazeera based on &quot; &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : first human rights organisation of the wave of Web@@ lateral bul@@ locks . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ M@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and Human Rights Research , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada , has no access in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada took his blog for the spread of colum@@ ni@@ es and articles , which he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , whom he set up to deal with the Egyptian government , is the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider at which also Zi@@ adas blog is home , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 and took up a video as the police officer physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly turning around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed itself with the blocking by the government and reflecting what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; this , blogs to lock is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningful to the world , so it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded in con@@ vey the feeling of a siege to me ; An arrest , an attempted murder , un@@ loading of the national Security Council , the lock blogs , and any other web site that I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I wrote not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to the post of articles to deal with c@@ ens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; now , however , after they locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mud will go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 pages . this is the technical test in the networks of different Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in addition , AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers through which the conversion of internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing was possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 we saw how the lock of websites , which we offer V@@ P@@ N@@ s started . &quot;
&quot; such practices suggests the intention of the government to block and filter content , which could have access to the Egyptian users . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the situation will fail to hit the fence behind closed doors , causing the Egyptian population to have no legal basis with which they can proceed against this actions against the court . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants fight .

&quot; day for day newspapers in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard drawing . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Je@@ den second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro murdered , &quot; &quot; th@@ ie@@ ves pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8,@@ 8500 soldiers of the army , marine and air@@ crafts to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tan@@ gible financial situation , the power wave in Rio reached the highest status for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
&quot; reports like these are everyday , and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper . &quot;
&quot; for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , the Editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which they proclaimed a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in town are now published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision stated the newspaper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes reports that happen in every big city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual violence , etc . everything , however , will be published in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we don &apos;t close our eyes as journalists in front of the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ ess , chief editor of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognise the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper declared that there are 8@@ 43 territories according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 territories . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war dis@@ course , when it is dist@@ orted , will also be used to disgu@@ ise the atro@@ cities of the police , who only sho@@ ots and ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the struggle against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and their partner . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; have more than they benefit ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bras@@ il , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ ed that the violence as &quot; war &quot; argu@@ ed that this is a just@@ ification of failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to draw responsibilities in the police . &quot;
this is no war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and worse planning , as extra in the analysis of military re@@ interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , education , and historical and self @-@ fake negle@@ ct of public service . &quot;
&quot; reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just his capital . &quot;

&quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 non@@ violent cities in Brazil are false , according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north east of the country . these are the most recent data available . &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the murders per state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which has been emphas@@ ised as Cec@@ í@@ lia , which has repeatedly been repeated for years . &quot;
&quot; to these safety policy measures also belonged to the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer the fav@@ ela of a massive police plan and to stationary a unit permanently there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP had to protect the U@@ PP after several reports about Sch@@ ik@@ anas and repression against the poor municipalities which should actually protect the curious police unit , increasingly under fire . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his article from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the &quot; &quot; civil war &quot; &quot; by the Geneva Convention . &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for human beings . &quot;
&quot; because this calls for the state to use resources and ways that are typical for a war . in addition , the int@@ ru@@ sion is in the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the countryside and the object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ ally damage &quot; and &quot; dist@@ orted balls . &quot; &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blocking , mainly due to the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , in Damascus and surrounding , Homs , D@@ eir ez and Id@@ li@@ b currently stands around one million Syrians in a state of siege . &quot;
&quot; the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack with chemical weapons caused the lives of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition come from , based on investigations of the UN and other human rights organisations , that the massacre was carried out by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these are controlled by the rebels controlled areas outside Damascus under siege , which led to citizens to be transported on locally or through tun@@ nels and control points . &quot;
&quot; by the lon@@ gl@@ asting block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat has become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as a li@@ fel@@ able food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ seam@@ da and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; the fung@@ i are not part of the conventional , plant @-@ planted foods and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , they make it an attractive natural source for many residents of the besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the result of the project , subscription Nabil , said opposite the French news agency AFP : &quot;
&quot; we opted for the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years that this project has been fighting and pushed his relief , that it now wins more and more . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative we use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ seam@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
&quot; it is planned to mediate 125 families &apos; knowledge to plant mushrooms , such as Dr. L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do on Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is based on generators which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C , and humidity levels of 80 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the fuel short@@ age , locally produced fuel made of plastic used to supply generators with the necessary power . &quot;
&quot; Dr. L@@ eila said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with &quot; &quot; production of the fung@@ us seeds &quot; &quot; before they tested their quality and if they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; they then planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as this , they used a bigger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; apprenti@@ ce yard for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , it is distributed throughout East G@@ hou@@ ta for free . &quot;
Dr. L@@ eila declared that it is part of a bigger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach us the fung@@ al @-@ breeding of various reasons &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot;
provision@@ ing a new source of food on the market .
&quot; spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , eating food remains ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new food . &quot;
&quot; new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs for people with disabilities , which are bound to their home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege is visible . &quot;
we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese calls for justice to the victims of the fires in 2017
&quot; on 21 October , several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts of capit@@ als in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that are pri@@ med in the north of Portugal during the week . &quot;
&quot; some forty @-@ two people died , and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government that the government proclaimed the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ flies that spread over the country in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
&quot; in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande took place in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitored the forest areas by satellite photos , in 2017 alone around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make you a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there is no fires in 4 districts .

the se@@ clu@@ able tragedy
the target of protests from Saturday was the demand for better relief and fire fighting measures by the state .
&quot; people asked why the civil protection was not able , the extent of the tragedy was so far as possible &quot;
João So@@ ver@@ al of the federal government of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday , they did this nowhere : there are dozens of roads from open streets that were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again in June , as the streets became very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , construction permits are under@@ lined with high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ sufficient proposal for the Wal@@ dre@@ e , which had brought the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was forced by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle for investment . &quot;
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity of the case , if the applicant had an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , led by João Sor@@ val in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made sure that large surfaces with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of light of light wood , like in a v@@ icious circle , according to fires of this species always spread further . &quot;
&quot; regarding these problems , the website of the Civil Protection Act of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when people sought information or attempted to contact members who were offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used the population using f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time via the location and the spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer of João P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade , so that the server pursued the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400,000 users that followed the fires , didn &apos;t count the website more than half a million . &quot;

for a few years he worked in a co@@ ach@@ ru@@ be . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left from his low wages , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and to@@ wed sacks with mort@@ ar , the heavier than himself to make himself up his life . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran were min@@ ted by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; remembered A@@ shar@@ ks in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , which we also worked . &quot;
there was no facilities there and no heating . we hung nylon before the open windows that we do not extingu@@ ish at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; with the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ el@@ essly , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that divided twice a day food in needy patients . &quot;
&quot; true , Italy is true that Italy is a second chance for emp@@ tied asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is also true that the conditions that apply asylum seek@@ ers in the country is dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centers . &quot; this is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff .
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a recording centre if they officially have an application for asylum - which can still be sent for months after the register of asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; until then there are people who have no money for any accommodation , to depend on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ fortunate lifestyle helped A@@ shar@@ af to free himself out of these conditions .
&quot; after having made various works in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he opened a second hostel for a while and opened a rapi@@ ds .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now subject of the documentary &quot; Behin@@ d Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - an Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award for the first time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , about 20.000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of Afghanistan operated companies , including tail@@ or , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient experience in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells us through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes , the history of their journey to Italy . &quot;
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua up the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to submit far beyond the italian gastronomy industry and retail , and aim to return to the country that he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ ks with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I never forget my country , and I can &apos;t live , if I know my people suffers . &quot;
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of the society and must get the same possibilities as all others .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af decor@@ ate plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can learn packaging and preserv@@ ative techniques . &quot; so they can sell their appointments on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepreneurs was a trip through in@@ security and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ti@@ zen &apos;s report is an international snap@@ shot that shows challenges , victories and forth@@ coming trends in worldwide internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a bill of bill , which predic@@ ts that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users have to be able to use the social networks within six months after the successful legisl@@ ature &apos;s decision on the website of the authority , as well as their ID number . &quot;
&quot; one who failed this step could be sentenced to six months in prison , or the final payment of a pen@@ al payment . &quot;
&quot; the law , which was recruited by sixty par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament , and shall deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another deputy filed a bill of law@@ suit , in which the harder pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the president or a high officials would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ulting of the president and state institutions is already fir@@ med . however , under the bill of law a der@@ mal deed would be imposed with prison and financial pen@@ alties , the right of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years in jail for the convicted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would have been a political climate , in which the right to free expression and assembly of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud &apos;s Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) on 13 August 2013 , when he demonstrated Egyptian police officers , who had demonstrated violence against protest@@ ers who had led against the military coup against the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest@@ ers who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in jail at a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed on the 20th of May because the prison lines of human rights groups failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison in the judicial hall . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups are embar@@ rass@@ ing , hypo@@ cris@@ y of other kind of arms , illeg@@ itim@@ ate assembly , murder and temp@@ oral murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal court in G@@ iza was the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting at the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
tun@@ ic activist to perme@@ ated documents
&quot; in May Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly heard by the President of the Republic , which expressly expressly accepted by the President of the Republic , according to the plan , according to the plan , backed by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali &apos;s corruption . &quot;
&quot; the document presented on 21 April at Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , casts a light on how to look the pre@@ diction plans for the support of the legisl@@ ature . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nomin@@ ation of his sources under indicating Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian Press release , which journalists accepts the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 0@@ 9th May as a witness . &quot;
is China wants to force social media to submit their identity ?
&quot; according to new rules of information offices of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China to write or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the rules , it is indicated that the registration will be required by the full re@@ tention name . &quot;
analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments in news will be reached within social networks . it is now un@@ clear how the authorities apply these regulations .
&quot; Chinese authorities have proposed only sel@@ ec@@ tively to protect these regulations , to protect civil journ@@ alism and independence . &quot;
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may closed the State c@@ ens@@ orship of Russia &apos;s access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat , to register in the state government as &quot; organizer of the information common . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a law dating back to 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government leads a list of online services to make the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows for removal of content and force them on request for compensation of user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently on websites like V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ classic ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most arbitr@@ ary social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has blocking Wikipe@@ di@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court disp@@ osed of the lock Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to er@@ ase two English articles that support Turkey and support the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication was locked to the site because they collabor@@ ated to &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ated with groups to start a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey is blocked the website completely . it is , besides China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
great Britain can &apos;t stop w@@ aking up
&quot; after this week , the British government passed the British government in the midst of a deliber@@ ate consultation on an increased security powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real @-@ time and to install digital programs to de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has cons@@ ul@@ ted telecommunications company and intelligence services relating to the proposal , however , has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation runs until 19 May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be re@@ directed to the Ministry of Interior . &quot;
