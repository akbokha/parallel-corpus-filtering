<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I had danced for American music, read American writers and worked for its sports."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a profound profound effect on me that I was mainly due to a American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless journalist who covered the murderous conspiracy of a oil-Magnum, who wanted to be inclined to his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after Method Man," I was like that the absolute truth is, forget everything else I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only been strengthened."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very narrow love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most exceptional aspect of his ascension is for me, as he walketh with his narrow-minded."</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as you say so nicely.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague it express, and explains openly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won with Republican Presidential elections, was the highest number ever reached by the party's nominated candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters with the people in order that I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, as for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme that people from around the world takes a deep glancing man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps World illustrative does not agree with the editor of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours to watch the "Phoenix Sus" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I experienced in Sandy Bahr, who fought for their life long, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with patience and grace, and helped my colleagues to accuse us to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me much with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those by they embodies my love in America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while dropping his way to the nominated Republican Presidential candidate, she gave me a stop and the counterpart to its limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or maybe just because of its contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for trump, because they were either convicted of racism and fanatism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair the trump electorate as roassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"arrange men, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficially and respectless, indicates an inability to understand those who take action on another way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities cannot be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of whom most knows are, for trump, because they want to gain control over a country that she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps. maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks with contempt upon those who look different."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(chapm.): as much as" Rejection of the White against all other ethnicities "; word play of white in play on the White and Whiplash, which means that great Van Jones had just killed what America has made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have, America is every welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country has chosen as his presidents, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the choice Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America's promise and says: hell with verseness, freedom of religion and all the term of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America, after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruin, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all this I have to think of khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"at a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have been my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd responded with a loud" No! ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" I roared the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried out, and their voices were louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone like you, who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and powerful "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan joined the words: "God is thanks to Mr. Trump is that not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"now Trumps country, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could no place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the outskirts of a large landfill, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular with tourists, but worlds apart from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years, the La Banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) has now been playing in the municipality: one out of children and adults, existing symphony orchestra, which with their musical instruments has an opportunity to overcome the surrounding poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos is known for their drugs and misuse violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after an accidental encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth had always offered a rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously (local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI):</seg>
<seg id="79">"once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the Trubel you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, horn horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that lies practically on the biggest garbage dump of Asuncion in the capital, based on instruments which are recovered from recovered waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with re-prepared instruments which consist of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recycled keer under management of Favio ChÃ¡vez began to transform parts of the query into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violin, viola, celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trumpets and drums that were produced from rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura, remembers the initial season:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place the children had no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: made up of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from re-prepared material and called the Recycled Orchestra."</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing fights.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, a magazine that targeted specifically on international, practiced solutions for environmental issues."</seg>
<seg id="99">"the republication occurs in the context of an agreement with Global Voices, together with Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia, before reaching the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were applied accordingly, and little inclined, a bill of legislation to be welcome to its coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the tumors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they refused to share one of their harbors, and refused to share a fishing licence."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything," "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fishing authority. it is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and persecuted."</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it didn't manage to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillaging the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Fishing Fishing (stop Illegal Fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"apart from Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are driven out of their waters by Somalia and Madagascar."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" thus, we have eight countries that are isans and work together. they share information and stand each other in where to be illegal fishing, says Tony Long, Head of Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden, absent because it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the intentional breach of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing once caused by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snow-empirio, with the information between individual countries, the actions will happen in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"the individual countries, for example, can exchange lists of existing licenses, news for suspicious activity or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursued the activities of ships also very attentive, if they move on the open lake, via satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"it enables the authorities to mark ships to mark ships that are protected in banned areas, such as suspicious driving routes, such as suspects that a ship carries its caught fish on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the ideal case, such studies show whether the involved ships have a fishing license, where they were on the way and possibly, whether they have a criminal complaint."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing may be based on the basis of this information, which means that the ships could not sell their cargo. and that even for the numbers of penalties, such as the Premier."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about significant financial losses for the owners, meaning that illegal fishing is not worthwhile anymore."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a Berners who supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to win over 20 million USD in lost sales, which will lose eight members of the HISH-i network every year due to the Illegal fisherman who penetrate the Eastern African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has put one of the most productive tuna fishing industry, which attracts the area of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also the same illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, counterfeit license documents, indication of phasienames, the fishing protected species and fish in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "you use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-mosquito control system", "says Long." "there could be a ship illegally fishing and a country could say 'You must not walk my port."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "" and exactly this legal conclusion is trying to close to FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="125">"so far, the finished front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">There has been criminals uncovered who used counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found winged ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to his collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crimes, FISH-i information can share information on illegal fishing via large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations show us pretty much in the networks of organised crime "," says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system that aims to help FISH, suspicious vessels of precise vessels."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed, helps to track the illegal ships to hide themselves."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the Illegal Fischer use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "" says Duncan Copeland, Chef analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO that also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"for example, some of the ships can turn off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be used by satellite."</seg>
<seg id="135">"this is why Copeland helps to build a system that combines different information of information. it should help FISH-i to help criminal act with larger precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team really influence influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oceana the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of each traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of it, who is doing where - this makes simple sense," "says he." "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources on the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this at global level. "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run on which a global system permits the persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals, but they also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships which previously confectionate and hardly have to count with consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i countries have a 33% increase in fisheries sales since then fishing boats more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped with Greko 1, the inspectors took place on the towing toe, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa, we will disappear several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there are six countries together in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they now also fight illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "with safety it is the goal of making even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's recently managed to report its first major triumph in Somalia: in October there was a ship sailing under false flag. and not only the ship was travelling without a license and were used for towing networks, which are now banned."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also located in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the take of measures against Greko 1, they were a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof of such a special, collaborative work mode to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. she writes on the subject of environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="351">"the mistake was like to the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also who placed the local loids on it."</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily newspaper Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult for older people and in an international city as Kyoto simply unacceptable," said Holmes. "</seg>
<seg id="356">"the incorrect English translation was first removed. the term" "Drivers" "(German:" "horrible motorist" ") was later replaced by the more appropriate if the grammatically" "Elder Drivers" "(German:" older drivers ") was replaced."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the Kyoto's police apologized to the Kyoto prefecture. furthermore, it declared that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from translators and that the translation was not checked in their correctness before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger was reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"it is very sorry that elderly people felt due to inadequate correction (the translation) for us," said the police. "</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News sat down somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of the "fearful" older drivers in Japan apart and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" terrible "was denounces as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved, but is quite a reason to worry."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture for example, 1,941 of a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, the seniors caused 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for spreading translators are varied.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for example, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to send him into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires active configuration of the target language - something that is in the case of native language. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from the French into English."</seg>

<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies don't employ employees with English as a mother tongue, who might make translations into English. this may be a misunderstanding of understanding, cost backgrounds, or relatively small number of English speakers that learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who even have no foreign employees, will still make translations into a company internally. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered the best to be made, translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>

<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely distributed - often with funny results.</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections have recently agreed to a draft bill of "regulators in terms of use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if he is accepted by Parliament, user may register social media in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, then a place would be established, which is instructed to use citizens to share social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with the adoption of the law, user would have to register their real names and staff numbers to use social networks to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if you fail to do this, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine of money."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill that consists of six paragraphs and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defines social media as" jedwede application defined on the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice, video editing and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is passed when it is assumed, as the design is supposed to be correct, as Egyptian authorities shall not register the user's users who are not able to register those who are not able to guarantee that the Egyptian government is unable to ensure that the Egyptian government is unable to ensure the regulation at level of social media enterprise."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Parliament of Parliament and sponsors of the law, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered user names and user received a user name and a password to get through the firewall to get the Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt plans to judge a firewall at national level around Facebook. due to those, it would be necessary to submit information on their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>

<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that same as they violently control physical public and private spaces that could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, then it means that they will be able to set up a strong surveillance system to support citizens that apply a authorization, or not. and that means a mad system to carry out the activities of human beings and to bring it to a trial process."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the Legislative Parliament and the Constitutional Committees before going into the plenary debate."</seg>

<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its seat in Sendai, located in the Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a popular prefect in Japan's Northeast which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighborhoods Fukushima and Iwate were forced to be evacuated because of the tsunami destroyed all the coastal towns of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, the Fukushima prefecture had already experienced a nuclear accident, because of this reason, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo showing progress under the local point of view which progress under six years later to rebuild the life of local authorities.</seg>

<seg id="550">"housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (the kinsatiai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the biggest success among the three prefectures could be found in Miyagi, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light at 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"still, six years after the disaster, evacuated by the catastrophe, evacuated by Behutaku, was evacuated in final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple disaster, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in comfort."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36 000 people still lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such guesses."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 per cent of the evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergencies, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuates that were evacuated after the disaster were moved into final homes."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number is here at 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools have been affected by the misfortune, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial building in the three prefectures is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 per cent of fisheries ports in Iwate and Miyagi, at Fukushima, only 30 percent of fisheries ports have been resumed."</seg>
<seg id="563">"tsunami and nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agricultural land, have moved large-scale stockpiles."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the farmland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that only a result of the atomic fact is, because only 690 hectares of 5 hectares destroyed farmland of Fukushima, lie in the nuclear plywood zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered far again, but also here Fukushima remains far away."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 per cent at the same level as before the misfortune. Fukushima, however, can only have 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that the disaster has almost half of the coastal inhabitants, as more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the indigenous population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>

<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness under the local population of experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey carried that 83.1 percent of local population, measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of those surveyed expect that there was still not enough in astrophal prevention."</seg>
<seg id="575">How about those who are evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition for the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also strengthened its attention to the position of evacuated Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima does not only have to experience the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, disastrophic atomic fact that Japan had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved in areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima off its home country prefecture."</seg>

<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>

<seg id="783">I can't be incorrect or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10 year old Cousin thinks that he is great. and it is not normal that people listen to songs about the" heroism "of offender, if they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, that, when would they have fallen to those who have lost someone, and those who have fear that something happened to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">"I see our weakness, when stories become blown out numbers in a statistic."</seg>
<seg id="788">"the crime of human beings is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students are justified in one neighbour that they were" growing. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to talk about this tragedies, if they don't touch and still be silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution" four months of express in the main city district: like a family with threats plundered, "she describes how armed criminals destroyed money from their business until the end not only destroyed the business but also their family apart."</seg>

<seg id="799">Journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the contribution "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a new generation of power.</seg>

<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was over two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody Leiche of his father saw that of armed men had been shot by an passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was organised by the organised crime and fighting with the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of citizens to public security and the government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Prosecution had 3103 murders per day. this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">"these are only some of hundreds of thousands of thousands of stories, which leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the country's soul."</seg>
<seg id="814">"few stories still live in view of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Apruna Vivir Con El Narco, "animal polÃ­tico has launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose aim is to illustrate the complex information behind the failed fight against drug dealers who has tortured the country in the past four decades."</seg>

<seg id="1207">"perhaps there was none of Bassels cultural prototypes as the work which he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005, to construct the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilisations and the Greek-roman architecture types with hiesky traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"Bassel could not know that ten years after working with this work, the IS was going to put everything about this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means Kichererbsis or Span Age.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network made its posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although about the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to reject people in eastern indian origin or generally used as adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" Kalar, "or more, (in Burmese Scriptures) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of Hasslanguage in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely slim connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word which usually uses ultra-nationalists as Hassspeak against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight Hasslanguage in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on his platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself calls not automatically hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that, in which they have discussed the use of the Word, or have doubts about the use of the Word, have been censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"moreover, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same accounting sequence like 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair in Burmese is also written 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spold), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The facebookuser Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends on the spirit of intellectual, whether they could not know how he could relieve his back pain by shooting a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the set ku la -" Cure "(ku) + the question word (la) to Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Hitt is the opinion that they can reduce Hasslanguage radically nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook has to be analytic before it extinguish all the posts that will bring racism in the suspicion of racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">The word will be used automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation will not understand what you are writing on factions.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what to do instead, is carefully analyzing the mail and control it by checking the opposite words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae "(spheres)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that this dirty nationalists, spread hate-language, received a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action is able to send a strong signal to all, the hate language, the efficiency of this strategy can not stop long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of percussion often becomes a catz- and mouse game, with the users' social networks simply start to use a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook has started to erase his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was watching this new guideline of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends, that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post office is removed from Facebook and told me the liken, post and sharing of content for 24 hours, because the post office" "the Facebook Community standards did not excuse."</seg>
<seg id="1317">"Facebook has a multitude of posts from people away, which have no negative intentions, or who just try to show their opinions against the enemy radically nationalists."</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail has been removed, which has nothing to do with Hasslanguage:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hasstalk of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author divided his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"on the beginning of the initiative, Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook would have to do more about the beginning of the initiative, for example:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a pleasant intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words become censored only even more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, as if they have started this without local context or technical support, and so words like" chair "or" Erbsencurry "have banned."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they did not have mistakes, they did not attempt to report the falsely dissolved Posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they only have something more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would make them a large turnover, would that be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks Auto censorship has provided a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make more fun and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasslanguage to see if their posts will be taken from the net."</seg>

<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to talk to his Burmese pages under control.</seg>

<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronouns or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect the husband because of the social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should use the norm to maintain this practice alive."</seg>

<seg id="1480">It reports about how this clubs have created a safe place for this women and they have made them at the same time as ambassador inside the mural.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini shows in their discussion group, did women who call their husbands at the name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">"she decided this topic, because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem, with which women can identify easily."</seg>
<seg id="1483">"according to the names of their husbands, there is a customs which they pleaded not guilty to all the liability and never challenged."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition tells us that a woman respects her husband and wish him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who doesn't hold this, is viewed as a mistice as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made thoughts about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini wanted to try her husband so far at the name, who had never tried at home with her husband as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "before. some believed that there was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to bring discussion with a exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked any participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then asked them all," If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Paine of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the Brechen of a century-old tradition in which married women's names never to speak. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy, that during the whole exercise, she only decided to tify it; another decided to release all his frustration against him and his family, confessing it."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in addition to that, in the Adrenalinan exchange with an ancient breeder, the women decided that they would actually try to be home their husbands at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they stopped their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a lot of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put the women in his head: his wife could not cease to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at supper before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she was stubborn, she was afraid, and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said that I should do it.</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of an participant in was less understandable and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reported how women tried to stop other practices, such as the carrying case of interest in the forehead, which shows the marriage status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would bear the zinnoberred dot if he would do it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I heard him to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women stopped not complete with it, but they, they are now in a better position to choose himself, not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the Discussion-lub is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we do a trip with every Discussion lub.</seg>
<seg id="1520">"normally, we pack lunch and water and go out to the box."</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to take care of the women, who could hear what could hear," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in recent months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; dancing and sang and spoke about things that they never had thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working for so many years to these problems and yet, I have been working on some things, for example as our identities to our husbands, never so honestly."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great, certain things can say loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"most of them is okay, but some wanted a Salad-Kurta, wearing a wide shirt of a trousers; they have not dared themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of dispute and discussion about the merits of its own wardrobe, morality associated with the Saris and much more, decorating Rohini her own couple Curtas (upper hemden) in a discussion round, so that women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan to plan a trip to Goa where they can carry Jeans and Rohini is sure to get it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether, in the five months since their first discussion was already changed, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into the roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have done only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times but then they stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women carry out Zinnoberred in their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"the women in Discussion lub know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the fetch of freedom of movement or its own wardrobe - at the end of a hard to navigate the river."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tell other people about what we're talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video Volunteers Community come from unlimited groups in India and make videos about stories that will not be reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" News from those that they themselves experience, "and offer a hyperlocal context to report about global human rights and development demands."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may seem silly, since Singapore is recognized as an independent state."</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam should be considered a town in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark was triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting at the International branch of the State Association of New York, the minister said that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore as compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He is supporting that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">No one has asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that is, with most people a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accuses the Minister of Justice to turn "logic" to defend the existing authorization of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable country, we hear that we are finally no country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the note of a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory breach."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons stated by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of that, he appeared irrevocably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, both cities that are permanent from a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as you reach the main point of the theme, the good old suffering from the authoritative machiners come up to be the first democrats, leaving the twisted logic as they fit better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the last week of Shanmugam, the answers to his American guests were given answers to our press, our judicative, our political system truly non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Related questions he blended with non-responses rational kind.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to illustrate his opinion because they didn't understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it's a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so is our city belongs to..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our advertised K Shanmugam would take on the effort to clarify this point when he was paid highly, in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by clicking on the blog his comment posted a comment on the critics, that one should start to read the entire transcript of the conference, in order to understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam better, according to which Singapore is a city or not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the script.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" "city" "as a country," "said that the elections in Singapore would be so unacceptable, even if we are looking for free and righteous elections."</seg>
<seg id="1712">He was able to see Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said, Singapore" is not a country, "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam as leader of a herald-growing generation that makes such polemic statement.</seg>

<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde that awaits me - I agree with them or not but that's another matter.</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not sure whether he really believes it is true, and aware of what he is defended."</seg>

<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the path of migrants attempting to cross Europe or Latin America, certain places for their hospitality are known."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tapachula. he is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is directed by a 59- year-old Mexican, a small woman with a cording pink brewer frame and gold colored earrings in teddy bear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula, and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather she) has become a goal for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has rather no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for approximately 2,50 Dollar the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, brilled walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - still hundreds of African and haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms. RamÃ­rez told us that people are coming into full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call:" mom Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at present it is rather quiet, but in this year RamÃ­rez had already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms but some have already slept on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She wants to refuse.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they are buying them medication that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm that are exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived at a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hoping to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracks.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answered with a smile. "I really feel it suits her, as African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao is traveling with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and her three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived already in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had owned by other tracks from Mama Africa." mum Africa is a well-known name on the route, "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"he tells that Haitians and Afrikaners often go together the track and that the Africans speak already on WhatsApp of Mrs. RamÃ­rez."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companion, Michelet has lived in Brazil before and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey into the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">"for months, he has been a guest at Mama Africa: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus to Tijuana."</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he is contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," "he answers smiling." "we will always be in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez told that her guests are often sending text messages when they are gone to grate them or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only sparking hope for migrants traveling through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a scougasse leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valencia and his family stayed in her small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that Bustickets sold to numerous African migrants too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he began to help them to receive a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar one dollar."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitian."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking site outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valencian explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after he lived for three years, he was expelled after a raid on his work in the United States after a raid on his work."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other residents, also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to press money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for a accommodation and an unknown, an Allergy, has offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family stays still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the gears, travellers consult their phones quietly."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"RamÃ­rez seems happy about that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">As a proud Grandmother bare her in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair folks that you made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and elderly."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"she laughs sad, while she briefly introduces her."</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-Point for personal communication equipment in Xinang from Twitter users, users"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority interests in Western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on 10 July, the mobile phone users received a mobile notification in the Tianshan district of Urumqi a mobile notification made to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the release, the app is said to have access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities blocked the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had replaced the app messages with a private sage group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the release of the police that the app would determine the sources and distribution routes of terrorists, together with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, ebooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom. "</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, Trojan and Phishing pages to make user attention to how much time they spend online, and remote control its own home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"of course, an app with these functions can be used in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" Remote Commander "could potentially manipulate the home network or even hackers to manipulate the home network of a person or steal it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while notifications of digital censorship in China most often focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant, oppressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme tidings and surveillance measures, as well as routinely internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"based on Twitter based media outlet" Images from Mainland China "(" "Alizards" "), the censored news in China released, showed photos of a checklist, where police indiscriminate the residents, whether they installed the monitoring app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinian make sure that people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected on a Checkpoint with a device without these software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"they have forced the people to use devices, which are intended for older people."</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest of the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China again.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" ("" e'ies "") also published a Jingwang-product description, from which the software can lift the knowledge requirement of a Windows operating system, thus making unrestricted access to the computer's hard disk. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and cell phones are used in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">"in Jingwang, the provisions in Jingwang may have a reaction to the instructions of the City party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content."</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity office at operation of their computer and communication equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned this new monitoring methods:"</seg>

<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist videos ". however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole range of other possible comparisons, such as those who refer to peaceful religious or political communications."</seg>

<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator had worked as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had flocked four cables in each other to present us, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>

<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib rough a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he slothes to his screen, sometimes on his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"what you can rely on, is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine lips to discover."</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the highest bullet of his family house which had belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank and had lived in Palestine from their village in Palestine in which she lived as felahyeen (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">"since now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, the conservative majority transferred to the conservative majority of gender roles, sexuality and free expression through art and rapist."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music that often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of the whole Arab world, he also urges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only finding out in his home town of Amman, but also in cities committed by Damascus in Yemen until the whole of Sanaa."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"at his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not affected by boundaries in his mind, and he can participate in his own statement with people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if it is not open to the US foreign policy, he sweeping against the US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, something with his identity was born as" Palestinian gearing of the second generation "- so he himself was born in Jordan and never before Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own living circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so because I'm a man, while he shook in water. it is the holy month Ramadan; it is the holy month Ramadan; at that time it is intended for Muslims to fasten from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee is little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"in general, the sledge of the warm coffee and the cockroar of the Kent cigarette in the nose are primarily associated with freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially when one throws a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, one avoids it easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan water - to land not in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has cancelled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"a few Parliament ordered that support the Islamic branch's front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the country, Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert chart."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MPs and former press-spokeswoman of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "straight" due to the sexual orientation of the singers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"in addition, many claim that the involvement of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism that represents the established legitimacy authoritarian regimes throughout the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to use themselves" for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is probably not easy to be a shallow rhetoric, but actually, a clearer-crystalline reality is reflected in Jordan, which occurs in Hdaibs work clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib came back to traditional gender standards that made his vision of the fate of Arabic women that have vowed sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a manifest-lighted unknown woman, whose arms and legs are stretching up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red sea, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who should have confidence."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past years, Jordan has increased the number of" Honour morde "- the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary killings reached its peak in 2016; however, Jordan was still lacking to support the institutional infrastructure to support women who tried to support murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on fragile violence in 1954, women who are subjected to the risk of internalised violence in prison, and for their release is often necessary for a year long bureaucratic expenditures and the guarantee of the family that the woman will not happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music also enjoys great popularity and is known for it, even to back on topics, which are long known as tabu in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib asserts that his work is politically, but dreamed that he is his music that is full of explicit stories on sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"he was buried in politics," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of Palestinian identity in an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" is the focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs that are politically politically, can continue."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, a verse is often repeated:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and any other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which you can, in his words," what you want "- is faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan was talking about the rights of gay and lesbian, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular Jordanian OnlineProgram Roya, in order to notice that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but only one worked version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals does not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nua, a poet of the eighth century, which still remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib is asking himself: if Abu Nua, who was later to work on behalf of the Caliph, in the eighth century could write openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanians be this?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemian Kingdom, there is nothing new anymore that the government attacks the free expression of expression and that progressive votes will be added to silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Agency took several former government officials and members of the teacher, with the reasoning that they would be related to comments in social media, which coincides with the deep in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of what is the concert of Hdaibs, only the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, Mashrou'Leila returned to the second time in a row but the way of progress - this is that Hdaib - consists of slow, thought and inner changes. it is certain that these changes took place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian Society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib dreamt, like millions of other Arabs, also from an Arab world without interventions abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dreams about his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is characterized by music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, spreading unitions and artificial art. at least, he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"so far as far as far as far as far as it is, Hdaib will continue to resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These great, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!! "</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one assumes that there is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the trucks, the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years were invaded, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knee."</seg>

<seg id="2157">I have a look at the Meguro Gajoen again: two festive cars are straight to see.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nonetheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the working version of the Beiter's Message for guerrilla fighters that published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who stumbled to countering affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question was the two young Colombian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Young Youth Foundation, inspired by the Young-Youth Foundation, inspired by the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to write young people to write guerrilla letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently, her country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces Colombia), which forms the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"international was considered as important for the signature of the peace agreement as significant, that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the Colombia, it is still a long way, until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrilla fighters, who lived for many years in illegal stocks, were exposed to a war rhetoric, and around the clock their weapons was carried out into the life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases profound hatred opposite guerrilla fighters, have to support them in their rows and support them in construction of a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombia would have to close together and assist with integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly this did they: until now they have written thousands of young people letters - lovers of former guerrilla fighters to welcome them again in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters which will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Laureates that was held in BogotÃ¡ in BogotÃ¡. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk short with Kailash Satyarthi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this declared that we love the people, which we love to write thousands of love letters, but those who forget it much more necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, he continued to share his love with people in this year, needed."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus, the plan to write letters filled with hope and support for former fighters of the FARC which now find their place in society and create a new life to make the discourse from a war history to a common history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2000 letters were collected in the framework of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought that someone would be forgiven</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipal authorities of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt traveled to the camp to personally put the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">Members of the FARC presented themselves as they had done earlier in order to oppose the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of subjection of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's unbelievable how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is between "," told the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had handed over the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut, where guerrilla lives), I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go away, because next to him there was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in a thorn."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said to him," Hello, what are they doing now? "he answered," I reply to a letter that someone has written to me. ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It's a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before me in my life, someone wrote something so nice, that's why I reply to it. suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I firmly embraced him and put me beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was too sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all those years of faithful companions of this fighting, and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life as a war. the FARC was the only way to store him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought that someone would give me my mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now, I know that there is a society outside there, waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace is prevailing, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the opening ceremony, students and some leader of the FARC came together for a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already existed in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"this is why the leader of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how the social injustice worked on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a destination of these magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"those people have never heard that had yet never found hearing, and to recognize that the people who I have seen as monsters and even hate people who were surrounded by their living circumstances and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but he comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused many harm to give us something, and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">"the Colombia was made, that after the disarmament of peace would rule peace."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to rise up and to protest against their rights, and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call all the defenders of peace - no matter which breed, religion or ideology they hear - to rise over all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and offer sacrifices, because we know from its own experience that nothing is simple. let those amongst us who defend life as foundation of existence, many difficulties will be imminent."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2288">Some older people said once my mother on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world, that not only your family, but the whole republic is ashamed. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she put a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"fortunately, the neighbours came and saved them."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"at that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window there was a car with darkened window and a number plate with one 95."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it was clear to me that something was lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends tested the numbering signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help, I left the country, but then something uncredible."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">"just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without, without identification, without identification."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a strange woman.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't think about, you are going in safety, just because you have forsaken the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">People know you know in which hotel you stand. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only about it to prove to you: it's the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This actually was my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about the gender equality."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still bear in myself.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"so much as I wish, this seelic barrier may not be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"in fact, if we chat with camera, I give myself trouble as the person remembers, that she reminds of her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for this, I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone who had dinner one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan was not arrested and tortured, but also that all the Ramadan could hardly wait until the end of the Ramadan could not wait."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now focused on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"that I mean, they probably invite their relatives, who take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called" honour "has experienced by blood."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: will men now have gay men detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend of mine says, that's not very many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, especially those who have no rich relatives or have dropped from their relatives to present the Kady's court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there, so that they can be present later than terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people had not simply disappeared, but specifically submerged to radicalise."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">"since then, there was nothing new from them."</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"this so-called Lord, this person was involved, when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not allow this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who were living in a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, which took place in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think before 2003, I was already familiar with a great deal, when I lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia initially wanted to lead us to the" "Civilization" "but eventually came back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were pumped; I had colored eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of the Sharia has not only curved me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian Theater in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks were standing, and all the city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a language requirement: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "mock is not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"they often say to children, when they are fun about sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply shut up their eyes from you, because they believed, you are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulting me, never hunted, and never smitten me."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long kept this grace time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow appeared on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality in television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not say about us, but above the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless - it could sense, as people began in the city to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who previously claimed and laughed, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel like the situation in the republic is constantly worsened."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I'm working as a waiter.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I won't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as a activist activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"at present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I agree with them as a kind psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we perfectly organize teetreffs, pastures, I invite them to hospital and help them to get medical cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't leave for a penny.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I clicked out.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim. I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alumber.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so, nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens that wishing you with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no tails with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have those who have the cabaret which Russians have also known; on the whole planet it is - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it's unpleasant to hear what to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here as many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims that go into the mosque and during the Ramadan fasten - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think of transposity to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experience. but that's a trusting."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different species of emotion to be exact, different living settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"I'm sorry that I will personally get here personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not so sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warned against an increase of suicide in the poor Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>

<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the South West of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered under Angstats, depression, and he was ashamed for his own helplessness that would come to life as Ahwazi human rights groups that would like to work in Ahwaz and anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"on YouTube, a video held the moments after he had ignited himself."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people made it fast to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Talegulation hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the combustion were so strong that doctors could do nothing more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only one committed suicide in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists warned that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - hung up."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have a thing in common: there were all family members who felt themselves because of persecution on Iranian government, helpless and unable to pursue their families and pursue a safe job."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arabian Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, in which a large majority of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to take their lives in the local Arab population."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"one century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was an autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and became great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest in Iran such as oil and gas fields as well as some of the most influential and most valuable areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, regional economy is still developing slowly, and the native population gets only little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"they are often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and abiliation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime refuses Ahwazi Arabians systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government also built a multitude of dmen, the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are located."</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dstorms have led only to destroy the devastation in the region caused by dryness and destroy the local agriculture as well as fish and palms industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab AHawaiian boys now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian director for cooperation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis that seek a work, completed the primary school, completed 55% of a secondary school and 45% have a university degree."</seg>

<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residence in London, Global Voices declared that the present situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "of suicide among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">"Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic origin, and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:"</seg>
<seg id="2424">"as officials and institutions do not preferring the labour force, the local Arabic Ahwazi will have access to business opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to annihilate the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs, and to force them to earn their lives outside of their homeland."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to hide their pre- and surnames to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, as even Arabian names will not be tolerated, because the speech of the Arabic language or the Arabic clothes are not tolerated."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"in view of the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi must endure, human rights activists strike out alarm before the situation is explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">"it remains to wait, whether the world wake up and know of it."</seg>

<seg id="2435">"the following article is an revised version of the comments published by Ayomide Zuri, and originally published on the website of AfrofÃ©minas. the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions were expressed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who refer to themselves as intersectional feminists - with frust."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, that women still earn less money in spite of the same education."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"if women are still under stringent observation, if therefore, what they are allowed to do with her body."</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women sooner or later, in various areas of life to a glittering blanket, and that discrimination are still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is conscious and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: if I come to skin color, racism, on black Cis-women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I promise, as we have always been suffering physically, seelic and verbal, many white feminists were silent and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"yet, however, all agree that women - all women - come together to sing" their voices, and "Kumbaya, my lord," to achieve equality (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexualised violence, an institutional form of rassifying violence gives up black women to two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or beyond that, black women and women may earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with migration background often rejected the school as a white girl, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black movears and women with a migration background are subjected to higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all the women, all men and all men, neither any skin colour that have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot take into consideration as a black woman who refuses to take into consideration the white woman who refuses to face both sex as well as the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and I will not fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, who always and countless others black women always rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner complained in 1851 in their speech:" am I not a woman? "and I also refuse to maintain a ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginal being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join me groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, in order to drive their egoeccentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to put white women the importance of overcutting skin colour and gender. because some of them will continue to be silent for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women with different origin and grow from white feminism, still the word" Feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself full of feminism and to set me the movement of Womanism, who was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of a white-feminist paradigm, that is so stubbornly is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever, that we define black women looking forward to our own ideas and take us into the shareholders, which are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: how we can defend ourselves, in which we can also defend ourselves in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be admired that make the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call themselves separatiism and exclusion after these lines have read, I pray you about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a bluristic environment, I can assert black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">"because of my dark skin, I recognized as part of this paradise as part of this paradigm."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of turally. the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# weigollusbin) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police officer said Ada BÃ¡ez, that she was nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who has become violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship there was a little time, and the police said that their testimony would be laid to the files, but they could not do."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another wife Balbuena showed because of abuse, the akh display of Ada BÃ¡ez did not use anything."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second wife withdrew its display."</seg>
<seg id="2486">The vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women had any display, they do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all in the prosecutions authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"Inscri1 strokes and Statistic en2 Invisible Misuses and a legal system that doesn't submerge subt3 of the laws: good approach, flawed implementation of strokes and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to see how many women are really harassed, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at Centro de Documentay y Estudios, a social research institution in Paraguay." there are various information and reports that have not even andestinise the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay, "explains them."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the figures are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, there were 9600 ads due to domestic violence. 70% of them went violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads on the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence in peace. here, 86% of the ads came from women."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women say that they were physically harassed, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayischen woman minister Ana Baiardi, only few of these offences are actually indicated." on each woman who will not be refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women will not do this. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"at the end of 2014, two women who do not do this because of physical abuse, will come to the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since the murder of women in Paraguay cannot be a criminal offence, the prosecution authorities could not adequately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"alone until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">"the co-ordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases, in which women were murdered by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence."</seg>

<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read it about it, I thought that the only women happened to be subjugated, because they are fooled by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetoric, whether he ever had the hand against them, refused to enroll that his behavior was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen so long from Carlos and left him not earlier."</seg>

<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine which reports solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredths, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA's astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was only produced by its own infestation and the question how many salads you can get limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents are not only for individual varieties but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special rotor or green leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the last years, more of such patents have been registered for more plants such as grain or cartons. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts have been ensuring food security in the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton is still a salad, but needs more than always longer, since his work is becoming increasingly difficult due to its work."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, when I would lie in a river a boulders, around which I have to pumping."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we must do this now, but it is a break with the breed tradition," "he says." I think this patents go too far. "</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they withstand judgment, no one can breed any more than new salads, because all features are already patented." he makes as good as possible and tries to breeding those characteristics that he wants. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and striving to use no material protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have been bred and eaten red RÃ¶mersate in the greenhouse. there is being tested whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>

<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name might sound as sounds, then the movement from the IT area should come and not from the field of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open-Source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was set up in life to ensure that some plant species and species are not protected as intellectual property, and for plant breeders permanently usable."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"within the framework of the initiative, called Ossi, U.S. breeder can be mandatory that others can use seeds from them farmed seed freely."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they can not do business with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders allow only others to breed their seed, it can be crossed in order to breed as own sorts - two aspects that are forbidden by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for emeritus Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed, and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to seed, seeds plays a role in major merge such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to breed the latter not or only little to use with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open source" movement doesn't work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. to buy our goal of ecological agriculture, it also says that the way is being offered to farmers in August and September 2016, should also know that the way that this vegetables is cultivated, is threatened."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutrition sovereign is not possible without seed sovereign. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to provide other seed companies in order to provide access to other seeds, as opposed to it, seed and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argued that the future of food supplies are at risk, as the available genetic means due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights on the plant material which is therefore always restricted."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, CEO Director of Ossi, engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation on carrots and their availability. it found out that about a third of all carton features are protected as intellectual property, which is either impossible for plant breeders either."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are no estimates for other plants, but experts such as Luby suggests that massinnate plants like wheat in even larger style are patented as a salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visions</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so farmed that they feature targeted characteristics - of such as their flavor or their color improved to such as they thrive in certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">"patents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to increasingly more patents. genetic diversity is currently unnecessary than ever since the changed conditions are worse than ever before climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto believes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. with a total of four geniuses and cooperation with institutions such as the Federal Ministry of Agriculture in the United States, the company established itself for maintaining the genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property comprises other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant diets innovation. "" a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">"often, these instructions often help others to come to the same result."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"so, innovation does not inhibits innovations, but encourages them to be provided by public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees that differently: 20 years to wait until a patent of patent, there are certainly no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long on plants to breed plants, which are adapted to the changed environment conditions, one would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources always have been a general good and it should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetaries incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"it is what drives us, and it is impossible to us if we continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interferes on the concept to patented plant features:" we do not create the characteristics. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form themselves out and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do it."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"in the U.S. state of Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" those who breed a variety, breeding his own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation may be used herbicide, brewed in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is accurate. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than such as Monsanto are) patents, the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject it or hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding garden salad.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the opinion that Breeders is highly innovative by preventing plant patrons:" it looks like that, with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that are patenting. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need a new material for my catalog, since I know my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years itself," "he says." "with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years, with what you can easily make it quite nicely." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the USA seem to be a leader in the" open source "breeding, the concept spreads rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which itself describes itself as professional organization in the field of resources, the centre with farmers working together and helps them to breed new varieties to breed certain requirements. "</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports it to come to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organization Agrecol works in an Open Source License, which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding) differ from land to land, due to the Ossi commitment not simply being taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. thus, they are permitted to fight against the current practice of the European Patent."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not a law yet; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch Organisation Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives from all East Africa to experience something about the" open source "seed movement and global trend towards crops of seeds."</seg>

<seg id="2692">"a merger of environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to plant and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Essens - an Verbund from auxiliary organizations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - have to contribute to seeds and improve the seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"in this report, the importance of a diverse, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems are emphasized - a connection between the Luby of Ossi hopes that soon more people will recognize him."</seg>

<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend around the 05.August, the Egyptian government issued the website of the" Network for Human Rights Information "(ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world."</seg>

ANHRI confirmed that all technical possibilities were to overcome, and not to admit that our task will continue to meet our task."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera based on" "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 and took up a video as the police officer physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly turning around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed itself with the blocking by the government and reflecting what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"this, blogs to lock is very old, however, has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningful to the world, so it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has succeeded in convey the feeling of a siege to me; An arrest, an attempted murder, unloading of the national Security Council, the lock blogs, and any other web site that I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I wrote not in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to the post of articles to deal with censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"now, however, after they locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mud will go the way up to the end.</seg>

<seg id="2743">"in addition, AFTE also documented the blocking of providers through which the conversion of internet censorship and private surfing was possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12 we saw how the lock of websites, which we offer VPNs started."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"such practices suggests the intention of the government to block and filter content, which could have access to the Egyptian users."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in addition, the situation will fail to hit the fence behind closed doors, causing the Egyptian population to have no legal basis with which they can proceed against this actions against the court."</seg>

<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coachrube. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>

<seg id="2890">"at that time, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran were minted by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," remembered Asharks in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no facilities there and no heating. we hung nylon before the open windows that we do not extinguish at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for travel to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"with the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
