that is James R@@ isen .
perhaps you may know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times reporter .
&quot; long before someone heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA heard illegal phones from Americans . &quot;
&quot; but there is another chapter , which should leave a permanent impression . &quot;
&quot; in it , he describes a dis@@ astro@@ us U.S. intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally handed down dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not look at the chapter ?
the US government .
&quot; for nearly 10 years , the government against R@@ isen has determined and asked him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became the symbol for the pattern of government , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to condemn and possessing journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to First Constitutional Treaty , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mu@@ gen , they give . &quot;
&quot; so when the government sli@@ pped in R@@ isen , he did something that many brave rep@@ orters had already done before him : he refused and said he would rather go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something unusual happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though they were for many years that it would be essential to their case , the demands of the government were dropped to R@@ isen . &quot;
the reason : in the period of electronic monitoring the rep@@ orters and sources can always hide less .
&quot; rather than to fail and rein@@ forcement to make statements , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so , investig@@ ators , without his consent , was concerned with his consent , &quot;
&quot; just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and banana information , its borro@@ wings , and even travel information with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA w@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and cra@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
President Obama spoke in his steps to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer . but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary convicted more than all the US governments in front of him .
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is home to much of their work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article about National Security was the result of that a W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; thus , we put forward the press work on the game , which should be protected by the first constitutional law , because the government has always more possibilities to con@@ struct all of them . &quot;
&quot; however , as technology of the government allows to b@@ ypass the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better . &quot;
&quot; from the moment on , they can contact us from the moment in which she contact us , rather than in the point of stuff . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that had not been written when R@@ isen had written his book , and it &apos;s much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source project for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , which was originally developed by the website of Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , which was developed by us today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , such as the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as in any ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot pro@@ claim more information secretly , and many of the information that would like it would not be available . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments always develop new sp@@ ying technologies that do all endangered us all over the world . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to ensure that not only technology , such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to as@@ sign ini@@ quities . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , &quot;
&quot; the excess of ab@@ normal@@ ities in the supply of soldiers must be modest and reported by over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alarm suggests the contam@@ inated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider that warns us before the coming financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&#91; 3 April 2016 the largest dat@@ le@@ ck of history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; have been hidden &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer by Global Wit@@ ness to have a statement . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to a declaration . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness to a Declaration . &#93; This Week we asked by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small gli@@ mp@@ se into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we receive an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you judge this ? &quot;
&quot; actually , we actually see the e @-@ mails , sharing the exchange of messages like the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has re@@ signed .
&quot; also , there are reports that a ally controlled by the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ al al @-@ Assad station@@ ery in tax ha@@ v@@ ens has . &quot;
&quot; it claims that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead over a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are waiting for the next publication , and on the next revealed documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of a agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems to weep from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in all over the world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some of them to hide and make their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and reveal themselves for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think of many people this whole world appears very conf@@ using , and it is difficult to understand how this tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always point it like a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so one company has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer . &quot;
&quot; it can really be difficult for prosec@@ utions and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society to understand what matters . &quot;
I also think it &apos;s interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
&quot; presumably , because there were no prominent Americans that occurred in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle , after which this tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a lot of data from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states to have less information to establish a company than to obtain a library . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the USA has allowed access to school children .
it has allowed bet@@ r√º@@ der to zoom in particular an@@ gling investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investig@@ ator in the offices of 13 lawyers companies in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ators gave himself as an African minister , the susp@@ ects money to the US to buy a house , a yacht to buy a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really sho@@ cked us , that all up to a lawyer of our investig@@ ators , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ ten@@ sions . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course there was no eman@@ ation to the money . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this as individual cases .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who sp@@ read@@ ed in our cover@@ tly investig@@ ators .
&quot; it is not about a single top pol@@ iti@@ ker , involved in sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , established through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound very good , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing has changed ever ; as if there is always the rich and mighty . &quot;
but as a safe optimization I see that something has started to change .
&quot; over the last few years , we have seen demonstrations towards more transparency , affecting the owners of firms . &quot;
the topic found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then the EU has grown in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them . &quot;
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the USA is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both par@@ liam@@ ent@@ als , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this giant insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to worry in the United States and global for more transparency . &quot;
&quot; for us , Global Wit@@ ness is this a moment for changes . &quot;
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their real identity behind pseu@@ do@@ ers .
we need executives in the economy that arise and say : &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use it , through laws this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot;
&quot; together , we can finally end this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
this is the story of how I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and in the boot of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; a day after I had completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
&quot; he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him to a beer . he told me what he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing even worse , &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him yet ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to land in the boot of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small luggage compartment !
then I heard me say : &quot; I have an air mat@@ rat@@ chet . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; How please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I looked at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what have I broken down there ? &quot;
a wild bo@@ oth@@ ful sleeps in my living room .
what if it is crazy ?
&quot; I got a fear that I went out of the bed , at Z@@ eh@@ en@@ pointed to the door , and my sleeping door shut down . &quot;
but he wasn &apos;t crazy .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the work of art , which he bought from me , is now in his class@@ room . he is now a teacher . &quot;
that was my first experience as hosts . it has changed my view angle completely .
&quot; perhaps people who were sold to me in childhood , are really friends who were waiting for waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accom@@ o@@ date people on my air mat@@ rat@@ ze , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mat@@ rat@@ chet with . &quot;
do we make a jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am jo@@ bless , almost ple@@ xed , my ro@@ omm@@ ates , and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can do it to transform fear in fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new fellow occup@@ ier Brian Ches@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think that we could earn something . our apartment will be home to a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; Air@@ mat@@ rat@@ ze and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at home for 20 dollars on wooden floors .
&quot; they found it super , and we also found it . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sure , our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot;
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we adopted our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I went to the castle . &quot;
had we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into rolling .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether you could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented our investors : &quot; we would like to create a website where people publicly tra@@ cked public pictures from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms , whose doors can be closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; on the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but did not put it out .
&quot; no one who is still in consol@@ ation , would invest in a business that is allowed to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we have learned them all that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; when you have a problem , you get on things that can be good . we could design@@ ate it . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just look and h@@ ap@@ tic -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense confidence , between people that never met before . &quot;
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
&quot; I would like to give you a cost sample , which degree is trust . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will comp@@ el you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone in the hand .
now I want to unlock your mobile phone .
type your un@@ locked cell phone your left seat .
&quot; this silent flight of panic , which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the doors first time . &quot;
&quot; for the only thing , what more personal than your mobile is , is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they &apos;ll see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; so , most guests feel if they stay elsewhere . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just like that , who actually has Al Go@@ res mobile ? &quot;
&quot; could you tell us on Twitter , that he dict@@ ates the president &apos;s office ? &quot;
you can return the phones now .
they have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had presented itself only once with his name ; if he would have told where he comes , how his dog or his children are hot ? &quot;
&quot; imagine , you would have 150 Be@@ ars , who can say : &quot; he really can hold on mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to release your cell phone ?
because a well @-@ made feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for the people to dis@@ agree negative gr@@ ass@@ essments .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest ratings were submitted before we ordered them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust one another , depending on how they are in terms of age and residence . &quot;
&quot; little surprising we trust the people most , which are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ essments .
&quot; if you have less than three ass@@ essments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , changing everything . &quot;
a good reputation for common par@@ ishes .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
&quot; in addition , we knew that confidence depend on how much you are priced . &quot;
&quot; here , you can see the reactions to the first news of a host . &quot;
&quot; for example , if one tells about how &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get a reply . &quot;
&quot; one tells us too much , such as : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- it is also not accepted by request . &quot;
&quot; so there &apos;s an optimal degree of op@@ enn@@ ess , such as &quot; T@@ olle art@@ works in your apartment ! I am doing with my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create it with design to create this degree ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips to which themes you should write something .
&quot; our whole company builds up hope that the right design can help , overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers . &quot;
&quot; with which we had not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than ready to dis@@ assemble these pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : one demand that had not been covered previously .
the business is running very well for us .
&quot; of course , there are times if not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have un@@ authorized parties and have devast@@ ated the apartments .
hosts have made guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when confidence was broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts if I just think .
&quot; dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the s@@ ru@@ fer , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us further . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily , only one fraction of the 123 million had ever had a problem . &quot;
because people trusted in one another .
&quot; when trust works , the wonder can be created . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his hosts drove him into the hospital .
he even sp@@ ends blood for the necessary operation !
here is its assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers , who tend to heart attacks because of sitting activities . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with plenty of hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Alej@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angel , who save one life , even though they do not know them . &quot;
&quot; you ride a car in the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they get books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without charge the extra @-@ nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , of course , not every stay . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to reach with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled across the term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the thought of part work together with monetary transactions ?
it is here about a economic trade .
&quot; but now simply to call &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; it is not just being righteous . &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay down a part of itself and that changes everything .
&quot; if you travel nowadays , that is to be compared to fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authenti@@ cally . &quot;
&quot; however , what if traveling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ? &quot;
&quot; what if in any place you visit , a group there would wait to show a group there , to show a thor@@ ough and one at a bar @-@ pent@@ ine neighborhood , of which one has never heard ; &quot;
or if you could learn a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are arranged according to the principle of privacy .
what would be if we would like homes of the reason to be shared ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would have thought of joint participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities before , which allow us to society and relations , instead of sol@@ itude and ten@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea , Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces included in the government &quot;
&quot; residents were offered now . students , who were searching for a stay , &quot;
&quot; they were con@@ veys in people whose children were pulled out , and they were incub@@ ator programmes , &quot;
&quot; to start new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . on our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people will be host in 191 countries with a fore@@ igner or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be so crazy as it was taught .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invented the wheel .
there was also a hospitality before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why did our work ?
&quot; aside from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the data of confidence . &quot;
design can help us overcome the deepest pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; I think that &apos;s amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da is over to me .
we know of course that design can not solve every problem .
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great impact , I wonder what we can use it soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think when you view me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , a brain la@@ under@@ wear , a terror ? &quot;
or simply a delay on safety at the airport .
this is actually true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; thus , the media people imagine how I look like . &quot;
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : Americans mean the Americans do not know Muslims .
probably the people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslims , it is great to meet you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double Espresso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
a se@@ al@@ ant fitness fan@@ ati@@ cian
&quot; and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I decided to decide .
&quot; when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ tw@@ ay me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as homosex@@ ual person , as some of my friends , but as a Muslim in . I decided to wear my head cover . &quot;
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ressed yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ust@@ ige was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , namely opposite the pressure that I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I felt a perfect and un@@ imagin@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought that , in question , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow de@@ vot@@ ion that deep@@ ened with each of the cor@@ ans .
the beauty of rhythm will sometimes bring me to weeping .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; ever did you ever feel that somebody is perc@@ ei@@ ving you completely , and yet really loves ? &quot;
it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , a child , I lived in the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream &quot; in essence . &quot;
then came that aw@@ ful morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had dinner at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; Breaking News . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ crafts in buildings , people sp@@ lin@@ ers out of the buildings . &quot;
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into indig@@ nation .
why should I do something like that ?
&quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country attacked , but in N@@ u transformed myself the deeds of others from a citizen in a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to travel through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as we drove me -- as we stopped silence -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid to become known as the Muslim . &quot;
we moved to our apartment in this night in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; and when I heard it looked , I saw the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful in well lighted areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t lead you . &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
&quot; then it was Friday in that week -- the day , on which Muslims will gather together . &quot;
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque might be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; feelings were understand@@ ably filtered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who were killed for Muslims , and struck the free . &quot;
there were really Bran@@ dan@@ es on Mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
&quot; because people , who had attacked this land , have attacked our country . &quot;
I felt the rage of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in that country -- it means Muslims .
when will we go ?
some people want Muslims to join Muslims and close the mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumour in the body of the United States .
it is just the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumour be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor just under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tum@@ ours in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , narr@@ ator and Olymp@@ ion@@ es@@ ics . &quot;
will the closure of Mos@@ ques America be safer ?
maybe there will be a few parking spaces but not stop terror .
&quot; regular visiting of a mosque leads to people of other belief toler@@ ant , and to show more ci@@ vic participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alized in Mos@@ ques . &quot;
you are radic@@ alized in your cellar or bed before a computer .
&quot; at the radic@@ alization process , it is found that it begins online . as a first person is cut off by their church , that the person believes that the person believes the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or belief . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still claim Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim in , as a mother , as a man , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their role @-@ creation if one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology at their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if you throw a look at them , it doesn &apos;t drive them what they are las@@ ered in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is its brut@@ ality that you can read these things into the Scri@@ ptures .
an outstanding im@@ m told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had imag@@ ined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy of which she had spoken , she brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of in@@ justice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given their anger sense , it was a major goal for the instrument of extre@@ mi@@ sts who spoke to a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m set the connection to God and their church .
&quot; instead of accused her indig@@ nation , he showed their construc@@ tive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she kept going to join the IS . &quot;
that was a gli@@ mp@@ se of like the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal American ?
how does it affect everyone ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ science studies -- show : when we fear ourselves to happen at least three things .
&quot; we accept rather a author@@ itarian government , con@@ formance and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if one reports about test persons , in which negative about Muslims were reported , they were more military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an acute problem .
&quot; when you look when the mood against Muslims are shot at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- it happened this three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run of the Iraqi War and during two election perio@@ dic@@ als .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manifest the public , to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , the sensible and well informed citizens . &quot;
the deal with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear may harm us all . &quot;
&quot; with the assignment of collective debt , it is not only to explain to themselves . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
&quot; he was in dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man , whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is such a young man , what has been a sealed young man ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit from Su@@ zanne during her brother and his wife , she was assassin@@ ated , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was assassin@@ ated , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had been on the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as in an execution after he had posted a statement against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
&quot; fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be moral , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or stayed at home ?
&quot; we sing it and for us it was not a slight decision , because it was about that America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can communicate our religion free . &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we left silent , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , my shoes went out , went into the building hall , and what I saw , left me . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then , the Ima@@ m made an announcement , and he welcomed our guests , because half of the meeting were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come to attack us , but to join us . &quot;
at this moment I am broken .
&quot; these people were there , because they had thought courage and compassion and pre@@ ju@@ dice . &quot;
what will you choose ?
what will you choose to choose anxiety and fan@@ at@@ ism at the moment ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you connect to those who mean : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have a nerve hit .
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who think that you are holding a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a monument with deep @-@ depth , therefore an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am usually as it is allowed .
&quot; if one looks on the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever carried out study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
they want prosperity to the family they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any way .
&quot; if people appear like an exception to rule , then the rule is usually broken , and they are not the exception to rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; as a platform for Bast@@ ers , a billi@@ ard store opens shortly before . &quot;
&quot; monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for professional dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research institutions around the world . &quot;
&quot; before the air packages begin in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flight machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they started to fly with ro@@ pes . &quot;
&quot; due to connecting flight machines , high speed and acceleration can be acceler@@ ating . &quot;
they can also build self @-@ constantly resi@@ li@@ ent structures .
you have learned to carry bur@@ dens to deal with turbul@@ ence and respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in autonomous flight .
&quot; with that a system autonomous system , it has to know colle@@ c@@ tively to know where the mobile objects are in space . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ET@@ H Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic definition tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our lab@@ ors . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest haz@@ ards . for example , &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a flight device which tries to strike two flying with a fl@@ ap .
&quot; like other starters , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most starters , it can float , and has great benefits from start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a flip side . &quot;
a limitation of tail@@ or is that they react sensiti@@ vely to turbul@@ ence like wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
&quot; the idea behind it is that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter in which location , the optimum position can be recovered , and the performance can be improved by practic@@ ing . &quot;
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask the fundamental abstract questions that penet@@ rate the core of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines , with a thousand moving parts that are gathered together to viol@@ ate you . &quot;
&quot; prior to decades , educated drivers were able to fly remote controlled air devices that had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern . &quot;
&quot; long ago , we discovered that flying with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple , remote @-@ controlled flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a movable part , an prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no valves , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only an prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , it happens in the inside life very much , so that it can fly stable , and can move in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear . to get it to fly , I just have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it exactly right if all of them is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleas@@ ant@@ ness , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this excess ?
they see that it is very symmet@@ rical .
this is why he is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; thereby , he receives the outstanding capacity , &quot;
&quot; in the room to move in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even like he rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some things can be displayed in models , the rest will be lear@@ nt from flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ ellers fly machines .
this is turning clock@@ wise .
and the other counter@@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; if you build it , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further if there is also restricted . &quot;
we will demonstrate this now by making one half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration was investigated synthetic she@@ kel .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows an aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took standard micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter - each single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with local technology and algorith@@ ms .
&quot; each unit knows where in space , and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
&quot; hopefully motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas . &quot;
the particularly safe machine da dr@@ ink@@ us wants to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us the salary is in the development and the creative activity .
&quot; it serves as a memory , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe , and that there is creative , smart creatures allowed to form them in a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the bag on the i .
thank you very much .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant galaxy two black holes are always faster , they turned so the mass of three s@@ uns in a tenth deal in pure energy . &quot;
&quot; this short moment , they lighten@@ ed brigh@@ ter than all the stars in all galax@@ ies of the whole universe . &quot;
it was a very big boy .
but her energy did not put them in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was given into space @-@ time @-@ feelings and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ation waves .
&quot; thus , we arrange the events for a time . &quot;
1.3 billion years ago was a multi @-@ cell life on Earth .
&quot; since then , Earth has produced some more : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God even arise with -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group decided to build a group of particularly mu@@ sty -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the C@@ alt@@ ech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most were they held for crazy .
but enough people have recognised them as a crazy gen@@ ius so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ omet@@ ric gra@@ vit@@ ation of gra@@ vit@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the subsequent time , the precision of lig@@ o could significantly increased significantly , significantly improved the detection performance . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run by some smaller , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ mat@@ ating black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and through the detector through .
Scott Hughes : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the goodbye to my to@@ d@@ ill father .
&quot; basically , these were the fruits of my life . &quot;
all that I had worked for what I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves like Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals for 23 years . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cr@@ us@@ ement in the emotions of space and time .
&quot; when over@@ flowing the shaft , the room and its entire content will be stretched in one direction and into the other . &quot;
&quot; to illustr@@ ate , lec@@ turers in courses for rel@@ ativity theory often perform a correct dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridic@@ ulous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us has been gro@@ unded and stressed out of us at the time of the waves . the stretching of an average people was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , the Lig@@ o employees declared a crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of a nuclear bomb . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about Gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties with the construction of such detectors are powerful . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are fin@@ anci@@ ally and with the support of the public , all obstacles are overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims that Lig@@ o is more than an eye than an eye .
I would like to explain what that means .
&quot; visible light has a wavelength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone . &quot;
this is quite practical . because so you can make a picture or a map of things to perceive that of multiple points forth@@ coming light around you .
&quot; with killing , it is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that make you very much : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain features like pitch and level , rhythm and volume to close behind the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now , Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; drummer Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot produce any simple pictures of objects in all .
but by paying attention to changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves we can listen to their stories .
at least there are the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so if we convert wave pattern in sound , we can hear the All literally . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circul@@ ated : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; the two bodies rotate very quickly , you hear the same circulation with an additional sound change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu : &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement of movement , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard Lig@@ o the following : &#91; Sur@@ render of sound &#93; Some@@ one who knows what he has to hear , know this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which are around as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what that means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in all , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , revol@@ ve each one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine this forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
this is the lasting meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o eb@@ net a completely new way to explore the universe as it never was possible .
on this way we can listen to the All l@@ ur@@ k and the invisible .
&quot; much in all , we can - practical or basically -- not to see . &quot;
&quot; Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why the stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about all .
&quot; these exciting physical processes occur in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers from iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never pass through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are penet@@ rated iron , as if it were transparent glass . the Ur@@ b@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it as the urine is conce@@ aled by his own night . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and most import@@ antly , I am optimi@@ stic that there we have never seen in all things we have never seen , which we can never see and from which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found right in the first run things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at the MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars , which produce black holes , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so , the dust particles are for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o allows us to look at a completely different perspective on the events in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the rust@@ ling and cir@@ cling of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ atories -- a brand new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ at@@ ories on Earth and in All .
&quot; for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ? &quot;
now the time is great dreams .
dreams with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; for a year , I would say &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of whom I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter whether it made me nervous , me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I was afraid , contempl@@ ated my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear to keep speech@@ es , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life changed . &quot;
&quot; yes , I changed . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain Yes that changed my life , an un@@ expect@@ edly article . it began with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; kit@@ ten , &quot;
as if she would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my bar@@ be@@ aker . &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the leap . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; a new life setting in my family . from there I swe@@ ars to me , always with them , as soon as you are going to do it . no matter what I &apos;m going to do , or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I make an effort . &quot;
&quot; it has a magic effect on me , my children , on our family . &quot;
but it also has a bl@@ oss@@ al side effect : only recently I understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ S@@ agen to play with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things from you aw@@ aken for life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I am TV . I manufacture television .
I &apos;m watching television as well as in large style .
in this TV @-@ season I am responsible for that 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each show offers hundreds of jobs that do not exist before .
the budget for an episode of television can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days and four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes , which are at the same time : 24 episodes : Grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run on Thursday night .
&quot; all over the world , my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I create myself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ ese . I have to find time , really st@@ ille , creative time to gather my fans into camp fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that are around the world . &quot;
do you know who that still does ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a titanium . &quot;
dream job .
I would not want to im@@ press you with this .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I tell you so that all of you who work so hard if you are now a company , a country or a class@@ room , so that I say that I &apos;m not only thinking about your computer , so that I say , I understand that there is no dream about dreams . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , everything reality , everything blood , everything sweat - no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ening into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; it is , when I turned up troops , as painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a dre@@ ad , one shows a high tone , love a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ √© .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ingly , clin@@ ically and foolish , cruel and sensible . and the best of it is the sum@@ s . &quot;
there is so a change in me when the work is going well .
&quot; a sum@@ s begin in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy street , I could always ride on her . &quot;
&quot; many people assume that when I speak to them the sum@@ s , that I would like to write my writing joy . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong she does .
&quot; but the Sum@@ ms -- when I began to work and work with TV production when I started working and working , I discovered this matter , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s ! &quot;
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum@@ s , you cannot stri@@ ve differently than to size . &quot;
&quot; feeling , not able to be different than to stri@@ ve to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it means to be a work@@ a@@ wing .
perhaps it is Gen@@ ie .
maybe it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I &apos;m not for the failure , and I know only that I love the sum@@ s . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear : the more successful I will , the more shows , the more episodes , the more things , the more things are , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
I love work not true ?
&quot; the land , which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s . &quot;
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
&quot; revised , revised , exagger@@ ated , over@@ driven . &quot;
the sum@@ s stopped .
&quot; now , my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth , that their Mama is a single working title . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people , &quot; &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; Bi@@ bs , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
they are the children of a titanium .
they are baby @-@ titanium .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum@@ s heard . &quot;
the sum@@ s of the engine was speech@@ less .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was out of .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ day , processed weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan sleeps does not exist , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a preview of Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I simply had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
&quot; so , what do you do when doing what you do , the work which you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you out , the author of Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know , you do , you &apos;re working to be a teacher , a teacher to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , if you listen to the sum@@ s , if you listen to the sum@@ s , who is it then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a titanium ?
&quot; when you hear the song of my heart , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ in &quot; puts me a question .
&quot; I am on the way out , late and she says , &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I want to say no , I will be aware of two things : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say Yes to everything and secondly , she called me not &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t call any more &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I miss it , if I &apos;m looking down to Titan and my Sum@@ ms , and here everything changes my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
nothing really special about it .
&quot; we play and meet her sisters , laugh so much and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of the sum@@ s , I can &apos;t do anything except . &quot;
I &apos;m focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country , which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , they do no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are stick@@ y fingers and mo@@ ist k@@ is@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Iron Queen leaves . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes up and an energy hub comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s . &quot;
and now I feel when I would know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is Love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we forgot .
&quot; the sum@@ s , the work@@ men , the m@@ um , that is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I say you , who I am , when I am writing through the programs and TV hours , and how working my brain , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is . &quot;
the sum@@ s is no power and it is not working specifically .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the river that comes from life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ awareness and peace .
&quot; the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , which are experiencing the present tasks , expect@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pered me God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this to the fixed rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ wing of any debt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
do not play me as working as working .
&quot; the truth is hurt , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer more at work than at home .
&quot; this objec@@ tion is painful , because what man is working rather than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I think . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we ras@@ en around the garden , before and back . &quot;
&quot; we do small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we grin@@ ded soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mainly stiff , absent , and confused . &quot;
I always take care of my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe ful@@ fil@@ s me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we stopped playing with playing ?
you can also say it ! do they always say Yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for na@@ ive for a meeting .
&quot; you &apos;re right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and you also know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mud @-@ show figure .
you will find less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they want to make something different .
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ √§@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaced me . &quot;
&quot; she speaks my te@@ ens daughter for 15 minutes , and I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more need not need . &quot;
&quot; everyone can bring 15 minutes on a piece , even on a bad @-@ mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes each piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no deposit . &quot;
the day is short : dinner and kids are done .
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my delight , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it is to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul peace . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
take the 15 minutes !
find out what makes you good .
find out and keep it out .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I victories . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass over myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes of play why not full 15 minutes away ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . the sum@@ s seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
work does not work without any games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opened up , and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , it ful@@ fil@@ s me and my soul . I listen to new ideas . I use it in full ga@@ ze and love my job . &quot;
I like the sum@@ s but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s that Sum@@ ms is not i ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and stick@@ y fingers with friends .
that is now my sum@@ s .
the Sum@@ ms of Life .
the sum@@ s of love .
&quot; the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful to that . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s easy to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything in the handle . my brain is still working yet . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land I run , the tro@@ phy , the tum@@ ours , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , li@@ fel@@ ess , naked and new feeling in me . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am author . I think about things I wake up to life .
&quot; that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ aming .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgical .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke , or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgery is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodies , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgical .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions of various surgical interventions .
&quot; it is certain that they have heard of one of the best known ones , the &quot; deep @-@ cereb@@ ell@@ um stim@@ ulation . &quot; there is a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improves . &quot;
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease affecting under hot trem@@ or and heavy pain .
&quot; Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ He@@ aling . &quot;
the dream of functional Neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I want to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help themselves . &quot;
history began 15 years ago .
&quot; at that time , I was Chief Financial Officer and worked day and night in the emergency recording . &quot;
I often used patients with skul@@ ls @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma .
you must imagine that at the brain @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mat@@ a the brain obli@@ ges the brain and incl@@ ined the cran@@ ial pressure .
&quot; to save life , one must decrease the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; rather than throw away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse with Jean @-@ Fran√ßois Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this tissues .
this is no easy task .
&quot; to grow cells from a tissue , it is comparable to very small children who will be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you need to find the right diet , temperature , humidity , and environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
precisely that we had to do with these cells .
after many experiments he managed to Fran√ßois @-@ Fran√ßois .
this he looked under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a regular cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you are still aware of the bi@@ ology classes , that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising that type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the OP can be preserved .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die they are immort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they were divided slowly and after a few weeks she even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population who looked like tri@@ bal cells but it was different . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came .
they origin@@ ate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ b@@ lec@@ tic in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ar cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fo@@ etus they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentrations at cereb@@ ral injury . &quot;
but this is not so secure .
&quot; one thing is , however , clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
&quot; in front of a potential cell source , the brain healing is possible . &quot;
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cul@@ ate the cells as cul@@ tured as Jean @-@ Fran√ßois opened
and it subsequently marking color to track in order to track them in the brain .
&quot; last step , we im@@ planted them at the decision of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transpl@@ antation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were completely taken out after some weeks , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so they disappear there . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we had a violation and im@@ planted the same cells and now the cells left -- it grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; here , see what we could see under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
&quot; proof that they show , are these small points . these are the cells we paint in vitro , in the culture . &quot;
we could not stop here .
can these cells be able to recover from a brain injury ?
&quot; so , we trained monkeys with a manual skill . &quot;
you had to take food pellets from a tray .
they did it very well .
&quot; when they had reached a stable level of skill , we achieved the motor mot@@ ion@@ ic range in the mot@@ ion@@ ic c@@ ort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to people , they relaxing spont@@ aneously up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover in plastic cereb@@ ral mechanisms , and they recover at a certain degree , just as in the monkeys . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left , they see the monkeys that invented spont@@ aneously . &quot;
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original power prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the her@@ m@@ pl@@ antation . &quot;
I can tell you that we were also very exciting results .
&quot; since that time , we have found much more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and later use it later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ic models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still being im@@ planted in humans .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives the means to heal himself . &quot;
thank you very much .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do this . &quot;
I definitely fall .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you need to fill in about two kilograms papers and forms to pass through this type of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ ate etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : take a look at the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission from the start of clinical studies . if you continue to see the future , how many years it will take until someone will come to hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us to allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to choose the patients , evaluate and evaluate the treatments , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multic@@ entr@@ e study . &quot;
&quot; first , you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment . &quot;
BG : and that &apos;s sure of course . J@@ B : of course .
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to look at it as of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as frag@@ ile plant , which is in reality , but as the inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable ge@@ ance .
we believe capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy appears in us in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was in@@ comprehen@@ sible to me as a financial minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- does not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought that there might be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my Auf@@ den@@ ial friends who would have repeatedly said that democracy would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you a economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy , our societies are in common , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies . &quot;
&quot; on the topic of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contra@@ diction that is currently threatened by our economies . &quot;
I called the &quot; Twin Towers @-@ Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the debt mountain , who casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt mountain , &quot;
but only a few know his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is , however , are to be anxi@@ ous to invest there where it would be productive and income to produce it with which you could produce the debt berg and also need all the things that are urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , in the US , in England and the euro@@ zone , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the prosperity of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; $ 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars is equivalent to a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the 5,1 trillion dollars , which were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to rub except the stock markets and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; so , debt and un@@ productive capital are the twin summit , which are not out of the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , who would not invest a low demand in which they do not invest . just like √ñ@@ di@@ pus Father , who would be true that his son would kill him if he will grow , &quot;
&quot; un@@ intenti@@ onally , the circumstances caused that O@@ di@@ pus kills him . &quot;
that is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely clever capital . all un@@ productive capital should be used to enhance our lives , develop human talents and develop particularly all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth . &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
but before we proceed . but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
&quot; Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as a form of form , in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority . &quot;
&quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , ended too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and naturally slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to under@@ min@@ ate the job value of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy . &quot;
&quot; the decision @-@ ending of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , and is that they did not only have the right to free expression , but is important and crucial for them to have the right to political participation in any questions of the stat@@ es@@ man . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept a long time --
&quot; like a candle , which sh@@ ines very bright , it is rapidly hidden . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but at Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , who ultimately had a stat@@ ute for ruling . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible , and the democratic process was instit@@ uted on politics , while the economy -- so the world of the corporations -- a democr@@ atically @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time , when this separation of politics and economy began , an un@@ itary struggle between the two are taking place by the economy gradually mig@@ rated to politics . &quot;
are you wonder@@ ing why politicians are not like that ?
it is not in a de@@ generation of its DNA .
&quot; it is on the fact that one can be in the government nowadays , and yet not in power , because the power from politics into the economy is se@@ clu@@ ded and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a flock of rob@@ ber@@ y that feeds so sustain@@ ably the animals of which they are nourished , dec@@ im@@ ated by the end of that . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that the policy is so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ alised that it grows through the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , the overall economic demand and the managing director of the corporations are to be anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their businesses . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism exp@@ ires the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of humanity . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that we have to bring together the politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; ret@@ ains control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from exclusion of slaves , the women and the fore@@ igner . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t especially good .
&quot; the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be , that the working arms only reg@@ ained one position as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : creating the working poor !
&quot; capitalism does it , as he replaces low @-@ glo@@ om workers due to automation and robots . &quot;
&quot; the problem is , so long economy and politics are separated , the automation makes the twins peaks , and the social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; thus , we must re@@ define the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics again , and that we would like to democr@@ at@@ ise the re@@ united area , otherwise we will appear in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ atie , which leaves the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question isn &apos;t , whether capitalism does not survive the technical achievements of capitalism , it will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is due to a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; Matrix &quot; , &quot; similar to the &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; in which machines serve people , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks the sense of life . &quot;
I think we may be optimi@@ stic .
so what would it be like it might look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in all . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : please ask a capital market before you are working , while you are working and in which your capital will follow you from a work@@ station to the next , and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
then all income from capital and revenue and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , but not work in it , and employees working there , but there is no exchange between capital and business , no big runs between investment and sp@@ ar , and ultimately no emp@@ oral twins . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 biggest emerging countries &#93; . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; Kos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum to which the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the country is equal to a joint fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested at the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that one had not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially in front of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe you is more liber@@ ating in which she preferred privileged persons , and Marx@@ ist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
will we w@@ aking up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; the answer depends on how we decide , together . &quot;
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better . &quot;
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you stri@@ ve yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ist in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s Analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have said is relevant , Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do this , the technological development will create a massive decline in the overall demand that Larry Sum@@ mers are called &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the Earth to the next , as we experience it currently , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is small . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Ha@@ ye@@ k , this is why I am a liber@@ t@@ ful Marx@@ ist , and like Key@@ nes , and I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are doing it too . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the speakers of the Red@@ ner , what you have from the view of the West to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the note of democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy in politics , while the area where most of the economy is , -- the area of the economy -- a completely non @-@ democr@@ atically @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain way , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to China today to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; -- do you remember -- we tend to associate liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , historically . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ alism , such as John Stuart Mill -- &quot;
&quot; he was particularly sk@@ ep@@ tical , regarding the democratic development . &quot;
&quot; what you can observe in China , similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to second . &quot;
&quot; now to act now to do what the West has done in the 19th century , a mighty smell of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as a financial minister of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely to say goodbye to the self @-@ fake , and the permanent den@@ ial that went through the euro zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek accus@@ ation -- by the way , the first proposal to reveal this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; right to do it . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continue to den@@ ounce its den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you are attemp@@ ting to receive a economic system that is not exagger@@ ated by political will and Auth@@ or@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , you might have a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and de@@ structive . &quot;
BG : which trans@@ itions do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change their setup .
BG : did you have any mistakes in your time as a financial minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Harvest ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who claimed after 6 months in office , especially in such a contra@@ sting situation , he claimed no mistake , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to submit the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
&quot; I believed that there was a hon@@ our@@ able interest in the bank@@ ers , to find a common solution . &quot;
but that was not .
they just wanted to bring our government only because they did not want to deal with the inheritance through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they conducted a cat@@ astro@@ phic programme for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot;
&quot; none of the Tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , imposed on us this policy , said : &quot; that was a col@@ oss@@ al mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive complex@@ ion of the conversations , you seem to be right per @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my critic@@ isms of the European Union and the euro zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone didn &apos;t survive .
&quot; because if they are not survi@@ ves , the released flip forces will be ro@@ mon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
this will not have cat@@ astro@@ phic consequences for Europe alone but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we introduce ourselves to the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be acceptable for the future of Europeans and the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you want to be wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you very much for you were with T@@ ED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; Roy Price has never heard most of them , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is a senior executive at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV @-@ production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an is@@ cop@@ ro@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard fought sector . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose anything .
&quot; he must find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are located right on this curve . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation division of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review .
&quot; will be rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then one has a successful show .
&quot; shows like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after spending a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about to get on the left side of the curve , because I think you need a special intelligence in order to under@@ go &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes himself more thoughts about the mean extin@@ ction , the average television -- shows that neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire them . &quot;
so he must ensure that he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and elec@@ ts eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online where they can watch each free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon gives free things for nothing , do you get too , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers look at this episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are watched by watching this shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you check out what parts you check or check again . &quot;
&quot; you collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show they should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data processing these and this results in the answer , and this reads : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republican US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many of them can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve was 7,4 , and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so a little above the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy is always looking for this a super @-@ show and he also uses data for it , but he does something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a competition , he and his team saw the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows them , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the spectators : which shows them , which producers , what actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a w@@ agon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competent , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; you connect these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
why is that ?
&quot; because logic somehow says that , in all , it should work . &quot;
&quot; if you collect millions of data , a decision to meet you , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years to statistics used as a back @-@ up .
optimized it through very powerful computer .
&quot; what you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so , this is something horri@@ fying because we live in a time in which we reach more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one is ever in contact with this software . come in touch with this software you are in prison .
&quot; if anyone is here in the USA in prison and for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if any dis@@ miss@@ al is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of choosing whether a show is good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; medium @-@ sized television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results generated . this is not that a company such as Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data sealed companies are also false .
&quot; yes , even Google makes mistakes sometimes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it is estimated that through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , which can predic@@ t -- by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news release . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fl@@ aw@@ lessly , year around year until suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand anything .
&quot; despite all these errors , these errors arise in the decisions of life - at the workplace , in medicine , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer@@ ized gen@@ etics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . I recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be common .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; to set this problem in his individual parts , so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second place , put the individual parts together to deal with a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and set up again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to put together the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is part of the pieces and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , then the information is un@@ complete , especially when the brain is an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe it was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and understanding where they also belong to the process . &quot;
&quot; you use data to understand their audience better , for what else it would not have been able . but the decision , how to set all these parts again , making it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that doesn &apos;t stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision . &quot;
&quot; however , Amazon did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they were competing for TV ideas as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they always could say : &quot; they say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better choices , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are only a tool , and to forget that this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
before there were data it was the device for decisions .
many of them know .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here in this moment .
I &apos;ll get it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far , I met some decisions in my life , and I would have to hear the ball in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much smar@@ ter , such as data analysis , to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; so , maybe the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . finally , it is on us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that , despite the great amount of data , it is still paying off to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; at the end , it is not the data , but the risks of which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you beautiful .
