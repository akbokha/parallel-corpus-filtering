<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">Perhaps you may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA heard illegal phones from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but there is another chapter, which should leave a permanent impression."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in it, he describes a disastrous U.S. intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally handed down drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not look at the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for nearly 10 years, the government against Risen has determined and asked him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became the symbol for the pattern of government, Whistleblower to condemn and possessing journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to First Constitutional Treaty, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mugen, they give."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government slipped in Risen, he did something that many brave reporters had already done before him: he refused and said he would rather go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something unusual happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though they were for many years that it would be essential to their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the period of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rather than to fail and reinforcement to make statements, that could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so, investigators, without his consent, was concerned with his consent,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like its e-mail data, financial and banana information, its borrowings, and even travel information with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and cracks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama spoke in his steps to protect Whistleblower. but instead the judiciary convicted more than all the US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is home to much of their work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article about National Security was the result of that a Whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"thus, we put forward the press work on the game, which should be protected by the first constitutional law, because the government has always more possibilities to construct all of them."</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, as technology of the government allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better."</seg>
<seg id="29">"from the moment on, they can contact us from the moment in which she contact us, rather than in the point of stuff."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that had not been written when Risen had written his book, and it's much more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source project for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the website of Aaron Swartz, which was developed by us today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, such as the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as in any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot proclaim more information secretly, and many of the information that would like it would not be available."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments always develop new spying technologies that do all endangered us all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is possible to ensure that not only technology, such as Edward Snowden have a way to assign iniquities. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"the excess of abnormalities in the supply of soldiers must be modest and reported by overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alarm suggests the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider that warns us before the coming financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[3 April 2016 the largest datleck of history has been published.] [the "Panama Papers" have been hidden [the "Panama Papers"] [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer by Global Witness to have a statement.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to a declaration.] [we asked Robert Palmer from Global Witness to a Declaration.] This Week we asked by news about a Leck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosbag Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we receive an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you judge this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"actually, we actually see the e-mails, sharing the exchange of messages like the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that a ally controlled by the brutal Syrian dictator Bal al-Assad stationery in tax havens has."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it claims that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead over a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are waiting for the next publication, and on the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of a agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to weep from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in all over the world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by some of them to hide and make their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and reveal themselves for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think of many people this whole world appears very confusing, and it is difficult to understand how this tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always point it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one company has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can really be difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society to understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I also think it's interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there were no prominent Americans that occurred in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, after which this tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a lot of data from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states to have less information to establish a company than to obtain a library."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the USA has allowed access to school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed betr√ºder to zoom in particular angling investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigator in the offices of 13 lawyers companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators gave himself as an African minister, the suspects money to the US to buy a house, a yacht to buy a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked us, that all up to a lawyer of our investigators, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all pretensions. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course there was no emanation to the money. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer who spreaded in our covertly investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single top politiker, involved in scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, established through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very good, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing has changed ever; as if there is always the rich and mighty."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a safe optimization I see that something has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the last few years, we have seen demonstrations towards more transparency, affecting the owners of firms."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then the EU has grown in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentals, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this giant insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to worry in the United States and global for more transparency."</seg>
<seg id="91">"for us, Global Witness is this a moment for changes."</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their real identity behind pseudoers.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in the economy that arise and say: "Intransparent is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use it, through laws this kind of intransparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finally end this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was almost abducted and in the boot of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"a day after I had completed my design studies, I made a backyard."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards, he would go to the peace corps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me what he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing even worse," I don't know. "</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him yet! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to land in the boot of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small luggage compartment!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me say: "I have an air matratchet. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," How please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I looked at the ceiling and thought," "Oh man! what have I broken down there?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild boothful sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if it is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got a fear that I went out of the bed, at Zehenpointed to the door, and my sleeping door shut down."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the work of art, which he bought from me, is now in his classroom. he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as hosts. it has changed my view angle completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps people who were sold to me in childhood, are really friends who were waiting for waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accomodate people on my air matratze, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air matratchet with."</seg>
<seg id="123">Do we make a jump, two years later... "</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am jobless, almost plexed, my roommates, and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can do it to transform fear in fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new fellow occupier Brian Chesky:" Brian, I think that we could earn something. our apartment will be home to a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "Airmatratze and Breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at home for 20 dollars on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it super, and we also found it."</seg>
<seg id="132">"I'm sure, our cheese ham Omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we adopted our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I went to the castle. "</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented our investors:" we would like to create a website where people publicly tracked public pictures from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of rooms, whose doors can be closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"on the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But did not put it out.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still in consolation, would invest in a business that is allowed to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned them all that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"when you have a problem, you get on things that can be good. we could designate it."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just look and haptic -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense confidence, between people that never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a cost sample, which degree is trust."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will compel you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unlocked cell phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this silent flight of panic, which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the doors first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">"for the only thing, what more personal than your mobile is, is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they'll see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most guests feel if they stay elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just like that, who actually has Al Gores mobile?"</seg>
<seg id="165">"could you tell us on Twitter, that he dictates the president's office?"</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had presented itself only once with his name; if he would have told where he comes, how his dog or his children are hot?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine, you would have 150 Bears, who can say:" he really can hold on mobile phones! "</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to release your cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-made feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for the people to disagree negative grassessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest ratings were submitted before we ordered them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust one another, depending on how they are in terms of age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"little surprising we trust the people most, which are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less confidence we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changing everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation for common parishes.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we knew that confidence depend on how much you are priced."</seg>
<seg id="187">"here, you can see the reactions to the first news of a host."</seg>
<seg id="188">"for example, if one tells about how" Hi!, "you don't get a reply."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells us too much, such as:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- it is also not accepted by request."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there's an optimal degree of openness, such as" Tolle artworks in your apartment! I am doing with my family holiday. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to create this degree?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips to which themes you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"our whole company builds up hope that the right design can help, overcome our prejudices against strangers."</seg>
<seg id="194">"with which we had not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than ready to disassemble these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: one demand that had not been covered previously.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is running very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times if not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unauthorized parties and have devastated the apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have made guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than these calls. it hurts if I just think.</seg>
<seg id="207">"disappointment that you hear in the voice of the srufer, and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us further."</seg>
<seg id="208">"luckily, only one fraction of the 123 million had ever had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trusted in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, the wonder can be created."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him into the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even spends blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is its assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers, who tend to heart attacks because of sitting activities."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with plenty of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel, who save one life, even though they do not know them."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you ride a car in the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want to feel lonely, they get books."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without charge the extra-nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, of course, not every stay."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to reach with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled across the term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of part work together with monetary transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about a economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now simply to call" "rental industry", "it is not just being righteous."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay down a part of itself and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"if you travel nowadays, that is to be compared to fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentically."</seg>
<seg id="231">"however, what if traveling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place you visit, a group there would wait to show a group there, to show a thorough and one at a bar-pentine neighborhood, of which one has never heard;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are arranged according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What would be if we would like homes of the reason to be shared?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have thought of joint participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities before, which allow us to society and relations, instead of solitude and tending."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea, Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking spaces included in the government"</seg>
<seg id="240">"residents were offered now. students, who were searching for a stay,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"they were conveys in people whose children were pulled out, and they were incubator programmes,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to start new start-ups in the Share Economy. on our platform alone 785 000 people will be host in 191 countries with a foreigner or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy as it was taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also a hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"aside from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the data of confidence."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome the deepest prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I think that's amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it when a red Mazda is over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design can not solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great impact, I wonder what we can use it soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you view me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brain launderwear, a terror?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay on safety at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"thus, the media people imagine how I look like."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans mean the Americans do not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people don't speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met a Muslims, it is great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double Espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">A sealant fitness fanatician</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to decide.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17, I met the decision to outway me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual person, as some of my friends, but as a Muslim in. I decided to wear my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppressed yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lustige was: at that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence, namely opposite the pressure that I felt as a 17-year-old, I felt a perfect and unimaginable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought that, in question, doubted, and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion that deepened with each of the corans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm will sometimes bring me to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"ever did you ever feel that somebody is perceiving you completely, and yet really loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, a child, I lived in the" Egyptian-American dream "in essence."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that awful morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had dinner at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word" Breaking News. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, aircrafts in buildings, people spliners out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the TV channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists... "..." in the name of Islam..., "..."... "..." "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country attacked, but in Nu transformed myself the deeds of others from a citizen in a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to travel through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as we drove me -- as we stopped silence -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid to become known as the Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"and when I heard it looked, I saw the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" be vigilant, "" Be careful, "" Be careful in well lighted areas, "" Don't lead you. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then it was Friday in that week -- the day, on which Muslims will gather together."</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque might be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"feelings were understandably filtered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who were killed for Muslims, and struck the free."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really Brandanes on Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because people, who had attacked this land, have attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I felt the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry too.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say people: "there is a problem in that country -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go?</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want Muslims to join Muslims and close the mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumour in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is just the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour be removed as a whole and a benign tumor just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumours in the body of the United States, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, narrator and Olympionesics. "</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosques America be safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">Maybe there will be a few parking spaces but not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">"regular visiting of a mosque leads to people of other belief tolerant, and to show more civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalized in Mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">You are radicalized in your cellar or bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"at the radicalization process, it is found that it begins online. as a first person is cut off by their church, that the person believes that the person believes the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or belief."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim in, as a mother, as a man, I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their role-creation if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology at their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you throw a look at them, it doesn't drive them what they are lasered in their" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is its brutality that you can read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imm told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy of which she had spoken, she brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given their anger sense, it was a major goal for the instrument of extremists who spoke to a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam set the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accused her indignation, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept going to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">That was a glimpse of like the Islamophobia and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal American?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscience studies -- show: when we fear ourselves to happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept rather a authoritarian government, conformance and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if one reports about test persons, in which negative about Muslims were reported, they were more military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an acute problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you look when the mood against Muslims are shot at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- it happened this three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run of the Iraqi War and during two election periodicals.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manifest the public, to undermine the foundation of a free society, the sensible and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The deal with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear may harm us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"with the assignment of collective debt, it is not only to explain to themselves."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was in dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, most generous man, whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a young man, what has been a sealed young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit from Suzanne during her brother and his wife, she was assassinated, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was assassinated, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had been on the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as in an execution after he had posted a statement against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">"fanatism can not only be moral, but also fatal."</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or stayed at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we sing it and for us it was not a slight decision, because it was about that America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can communicate our religion free."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we left silent, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, my shoes went out, went into the building hall, and what I saw, left me."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then, the Imam made an announcement, and he welcomed our guests, because half of the meeting were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come to attack us, but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I am broken.</seg>
<seg id="388">"these people were there, because they had thought courage and compassion and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose to choose anxiety and fanatism at the moment?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those who mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia you seem to have a nerve hit.</seg>
<seg id="396">"but I wonder what do you say to those who think that you are holding a TEDTalk, a monument with deep-depth, therefore an exception and not the rule."</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">"Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I am completely normal."</seg>

<seg id="402">"if one looks on the Muslims around the world, and I did that with the greatest ever carried out study to Muslims around the world, people want normal things."</seg>

<seg id="407">"as a platform for Basters, a billiard store opens shortly before."</seg>
<seg id="408">"monitoring, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for professional drones. it is made possible in research institutions around the world."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before the air packages begin in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flight machines at the Frac Centre in France has built a six-metre tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they started to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"due to connecting flight machines, high speed and acceleration can be accelerating."</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-constantly resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned to carry burdens to deal with turbulence and respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"with that a system autonomous system, it has to know collectively to know where the mobile objects are in space."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic definition tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a branch of our labors."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest hazards. for example," start "and" land. ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device which tries to strike two flying with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"unlike most starters, it can float, and has great benefits from start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a flip side."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of tailor is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">"the idea behind it is that the flight device doesn't matter in which location, the optimum position can be recovered, and the performance can be improved by practicing."</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask the fundamental abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines, with a thousand moving parts that are gathered together to violate you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"prior to decades, educated drivers were able to fly remote controlled air devices that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern."</seg>
<seg id="435">"long ago, we discovered that flying with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospinner, the mechanically simple, remote-controlled flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, an propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no valves, hinges and cross-rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only an propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, it happens in the inside life very much, so that it can fly stable, and can move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear. to get it to fly, I just have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of throwing it exactly right if all of them is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when Monospinner is an exercise in pleasantness, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this excess?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is very symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">This is why he is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"thereby, he receives the outstanding capacity,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"in the room to move in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even like he rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some things can be displayed in models, the rest will be learnt from flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propellers fly machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is turning clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"if you build it, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls out, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further if there is also restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now by making one half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was investigated synthetic shekel.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows an aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-Quadcopter - each single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and outfit them with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit knows where in space, and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">"hopefully motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas."</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine da drinkus wants to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>

<seg id="466">"it serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe, and that there is creative, smart creatures allowed to form them in a spectacular way."</seg>

<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was given into space-time-feelings and the universe exploded in gravitation waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">"thus, we arrange the events for a time."</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago was a multi-cell life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, Earth has produced some more: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God even arise with -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group decided to build a group of particularly musty -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- to search for gravitational waves caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most were they held for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people have recognised them as a crazy genius so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometric gravitation of gravitation."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the subsequent time, the precision of ligo could significantly increased significantly, significantly improved the detection performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run by some smaller, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, just a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two collimatating black holes through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector through.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, these were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for what I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he studied gravitational waves like Ligo measurable signals for 23 years. but what are gravitational waves? "</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crusement in the emotions of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when overflowing the shaft, the room and its entire content will be stretched in one direction and into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to illustrate, lecturers in courses for relativity theory often perform a correct dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us has been grounded and stressed out of us at the time of the waves. the stretching of an average people was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1. therefore, the Ligo employees declared a crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometer long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear bomb. that's grotesk."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties with the construction of such detectors are powerful. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are financially and with the support of the public, all obstacles are overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims that Ligo is more than an eye than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what that means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phone."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. because so you can make a picture or a map of things to perceive that of multiple points forthcoming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">"with killing, it is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that make you very much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain features like pitch and level, rhythm and volume to close behind the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"drummer Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least there are the measured frequencies in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wave pattern in sound, we can hear the All literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravitation to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circulated: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"the two bodies rotate very quickly, you hear the same circulation with an additional sound change. that sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu:"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement of movement, shaped into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard Ligo the following: [Surrender of sound] Someone who knows what he has to hear, know this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which are around as fast as the rods of your Mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each one hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the lasting meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo ebnet a completely new way to explore the universe as it never was possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All lurk and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">"much in all, we can - practical or basically -- not to see."</seg>
<seg id="536">"Supernova, for example. I would like to know why the stars in Supernovae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about all.</seg>
<seg id="538">"these exciting physical processes occur in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers from iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves are penetrated iron, as if it were transparent glass. the Urbang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it as the urine is concealed by his own night."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and most importantly, I am optimistic that there we have never seen in all things we have never seen, which we can never see and from which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found right in the first run things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at the MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars, which produce black holes, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so, the dust particles are for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo allows us to look at a completely different perspective on the events in all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the rustling and circling of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatories -- a brand new generation of Observatories on Earth and in All.</seg>
<seg id="550">"for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?"</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>

<seg id="561">Would I start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I was afraid, contemplated my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear to keep speeches, my social fear -- puff, gone."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life changed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes, I changed."</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain Yes that changed my life, an unexpectedly article. it began with a question of my little ones."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls for inexplicable reasons all" kitten, "</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kitten, I need milk for my barbeaker."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the leap. and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new life setting in my family. from there I swears to me, always with them, as soon as you are going to do it. no matter what I'm going to do, or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I make an effort."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magic effect on me, my children, on our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a blossal side effect: only recently I understood that the "Yes" -Sagen to play with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things from you awaken for life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I am TV. I manufacture television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm watching television as well as in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season I am responsible for that 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show offers hundreds of jobs that do not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of television can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days and four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes, which are at the same time: 24 episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I create myself, and not only produced, so still obese. I have to find time, really stille, creative time to gather my fans into camp fire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that are around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who that still does?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a titanium."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you so that all of you who work so hard if you are now a company, a country or a classroom, so that I say that I'm not only thinking about your computer, so that I say, I understand that there is no dream about dreams."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, everything reality, everything blood, everything sweat - no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work much, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deepening into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I turned up troops, as painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a dread, one shows a high tone, love a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyonc√©.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and stubborningly, clinically and foolish, cruel and sensible. and the best of it is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a sums begin in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums sounds like a busy street, I could always ride on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume that when I speak to them the sums, that I would like to write my writing joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong she does.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the Summs -- when I began to work and work with TV production when I started working and working, I discovered this matter, this sums, this energy. the sums!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sums, you cannot strive differently than to size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling, not able to be different than to strive to size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means to be a workawing.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is Genie.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I'm not for the failure, and I know only that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make it clear: the more successful I will, the more shows, the more episodes, the more things, the more things are, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there is."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land, which I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, revised, exaggerated, overdriven."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that their Mama is a single working title."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people," "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says," Bibs, I want to go to Shonda Land. "</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby-titanium.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was out of.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours-day, processed weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a Titan sleeps does not exist, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a preview of Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I simply had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so, what do you do when doing what you do, the work which you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" "Heul you out, the author of Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know, you do, you're working to be a teacher, a teacher to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, if you listen to the sums, if you listen to the sums, who is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when you hear the song of my heart, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitin" puts me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late and she says," Mum, do you like playing? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I want to say no, I will be aware of two things:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say Yes to everything and secondly, she called me not" kitten. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">They don't call any more "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it, if I'm looking down to Titan and my Summs, and here everything changes my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mum, do you like playing? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">Nothing really special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and meet her sisters, laugh so much and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and lack of the sums, I can't do anything except."</seg>
<seg id="684">I'm focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, which I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high tone, they do no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, tender voices, wax crayons and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl in" The Iron Queen leaves. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy hub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"the sums, but a sums."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel when I would know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is Love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the workmen, the mum, that is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I say you, who I am, when I am writing through the programs and TV hours, and how working my brain, then I forgot what the real sums is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no power and it is not working specifically.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river that comes from life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums ignores the pressure of history, which are experiencing the present tasks, expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered me God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this to the fixed rule, so that I can free myself as a workawing of any debt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Do not play me as working as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth is hurt,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer more at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this objection is painful, because what man is working rather than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I think."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen around the garden, before and back."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we do small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We grinded soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mainly stiff, absent, and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take care of my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfils me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we stopped playing with playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! do they always say Yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naive for a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="742">"you're right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you also know why? they are not Rihanna or a mud-show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">You will find less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they want to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">"there are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">"after 15 minutes, a Marienk√§fer or biscuit replaced me."</seg>
<seg id="750">"she speaks my teens daughter for 15 minutes, and I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more need not need."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can bring 15 minutes on a piece, even on a bad-mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes each piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no deposit."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner and kids are done.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my delight, my world. they don't have to be the children. it is to feel the sums to have a place for his soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with their own children. it's about joy,"</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Take the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what makes you good.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I victories. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training, when I wanted to surpass over myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes of play why not full 15 minutes away?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without any games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opened up, and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fulfils me and my soul. I listen to new ideas. I use it in full gaze and love my job."</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums that Summs is not i... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">That is now my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The Summs of Life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful to that."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it's easy to me that I'm a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in the handle. my brain is still working yet. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the more happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land I run, the trophy, the tumours, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, lifeless, naked and new feeling in me. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think about things I wake up to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"that belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a bit dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke, or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgery is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodies, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions of various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"it is certain that they have heard of one of the best known ones, the" deep-cerebellum stimulation. "there is a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease affecting under hot tremor and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"Neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-Healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional Neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help themselves."</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">"at that time, I was Chief Financial Officer and worked day and night in the emergency recording."</seg>
<seg id="813">I often used patients with skulls-Hirn-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You must imagine that at the brain-Hirn-Traumata the brain obliges the brain and inclined the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, one must decrease the cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"rather than throw away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse with Jean-Fran√ßois Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells out of this tissues.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to grow cells from a tissue, it is comparable to very small children who will be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you need to find the right diet, temperature, humidity, and environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">Precisely that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many experiments he managed to Fran√ßois-Fran√ßois.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he looked under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a regular cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you are still aware of the biology classes, that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising that type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the OP can be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were divided slowly and after a few weeks she even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population who looked like tribal cells but it was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublectic in-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebellar cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the foetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher concentrations at cerebral injury."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">"one thing is, however, clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">"in front of a potential cell source, the brain healing is possible."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then culate the cells as cultured as Jean-Fran√ßois opened</seg>
<seg id="853">And it subsequently marking color to track in order to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"last step, we implanted them at the decision of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were completely taken out after some weeks, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there, so they disappear there."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we had a violation and implanted the same cells and now the cells left -- it grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">"here, see what we could see under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"proof that they show, are these small points. these are the cells we paint in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells be able to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we trained monkeys with a manual skill."</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable level of skill, we achieved the motor motionic range in the motionic cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen to people, they relaxing spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then try to recover in plastic cerebral mechanisms, and they recover at a certain degree, just as in the monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left, they see the monkeys that invented spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original power prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the hermplantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were also very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found much more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathic models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still being implanted in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives the means to heal himself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do this. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely fall.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you need to fill in about two kilograms papers and forms to pass through this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delikate etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and a professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: take a look at the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission from the start of clinical studies. if you continue to see the future, how many years it will take until someone will come to hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to choose the patients, evaluate and evaluate the treatments, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multicentre study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment."</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that's sure of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to look at it as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as fragile plant, which is in reality, but as the inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable geance.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy appears in us in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was incomprehensible to me as a financial minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- does not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my Aufdenial friends who would have repeatedly said that democracy would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you a economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy, our societies are in common, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the topic of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened by our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I called the "Twin Towers-Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the debt mountain, who casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few know his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which is, however, are to be anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income to produce it with which you could produce the debt berg and also need all the things that are urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, in the US, in England and the eurozone, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the prosperity of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"$3.4 trillion U.S. dollars is equivalent to a lot of money until one compares it with the 5,1 trillion dollars, which were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to rub except the stock markets and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"so, debt and unproductive capital are the twin summit, which are not out of the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, who would not invest a low demand in which they do not invest. just like √ñdipus Father, who would be true that his son would kill him if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"unintentionally, the circumstances caused that Odipus kills him."</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely clever capital. all unproductive capital should be used to enhance our lives, develop human talents and develop particularly all the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we proceed. but before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">"Aristotle defined democracy as a form of form, in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority."</seg>
<seg id="931">"the Athenian democracy, of course, ended too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and naturally slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to underminate the job value of the Athenian democracy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision-ending of the Athenian democracy, and is that they did not only have the right to free expression, but is important and crucial for them to have the right to political participation in any questions of the statesman."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not kept a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines very bright, it is rapidly hidden."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our current liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but at Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, who ultimately had a statute for ruling."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible, and the democratic process was instituted on politics, while the economy -- so the world of the corporations -- a democratically-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our current democracies, since the time, when this separation of politics and economy began, an unitary struggle between the two are taking place by the economy gradually migrated to politics."</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are not like that?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is on the fact that one can be in the government nowadays, and yet not in power, because the power from politics into the economy is secluded and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a flock of robbery that feeds so sustainably the animals of which they are nourished, decimated by the end of that."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that the policy is so far cannibalised that it grows through the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, the overall economic demand and the managing director of the corporations are to be anxious to invest the cash of their businesses."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism expires the" demos "[the people] from democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"it is obvious that we have to bring together the politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the" demos "retains control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from exclusion of slaves, the women and the foreigner."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it wasn't especially good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be, that the working arms only regained one position as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">"capitalism does it, as he replaces low-gloom workers due to automation and robots."</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, so long economy and politics are separated, the automation makes the twins peaks, and the social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"thus, we must redefine the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics again, and that we would like to democratise the reunited area, otherwise we will appear in a pathological monitoring hyperautocratie, which leaves the film" Matrix "as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question isn't, whether capitalism does not survive the technical achievements of capitalism, it will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is due to a dystopia, similar to the" Matrix "," similar to the "" Star Trek "," in which machines serve people, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks the sense of life. "</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like it might look like this "star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -like dystia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in all."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: please ask a capital market before you are working, while you are working and in which your capital will follow you from a workstation to the next, and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and revenue and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company, but not work in it, and employees working there, but there is no exchange between capital and business, no big runs between investment and spar, and ultimately no emporal twins."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 biggest emerging countries]."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" Kosmos, "in units of" Kosmos "" -- and every government pays the sum to which the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the country is equal to a joint fund. "</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund has invested in" green "technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investment are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that one had not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially in front of a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe you is more liberating in which she preferred privileged persons, and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trash of history, and keynesian, global keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we waking up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">"the answer depends on how we decide, together."</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>

<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have said is relevant, Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for reunification of politics and economy is... do we do this, the technological development will create a massive decline in the overall demand that Larry Summers are called" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the Earth to the next, as we experience it currently, it will not only destabilise our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is small."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as Hayek, this is why I am a libertful Marxist, and like Keynes, and I am also perfect."</seg>

<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your talk, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the speakers of the Redner, what you have from the view of the West to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"in our liberal democracies, we have the note of democracy."</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited the democracy in politics, while the area where most of the economy is, -- the area of the economy -- a completely non-democratically-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain way, if I may say so provocative, China is similar to China today to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"-- do you remember -- we tend to associate liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, historically."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberalism, such as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">"he was particularly skeptical, regarding the democratic development."</seg>
<seg id="998">"what you can observe in China, similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now to act now to do what the West has done in the 19th century, a mighty smell of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as a financial minister of Greece in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to say goodbye to the self-fake, and the permanent denial that went through the euro zone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek accusation -- by the way, the first proposal to reveal this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"right to do it. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continue to denounce its denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>

<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any minister, who claimed after 6 months in office, especially in such a contrasting situation, he claimed no mistake, then it is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to submit the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>

<seg id="1038">"Roy Price has never heard most of them, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is a senior executive at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an iscoprour and describes himself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard fought sector."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't choose anything.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are located right on this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation division of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"will be rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive, where, after spending a season, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows how" Toddlers and tiaras "-- -- that should tell you what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about to get on the left side of the curve, because I think you need a special intelligence in order to undergo" Toddlers and tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes himself more thoughts about the mean extinction, the average television -- shows that neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire them."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something, that's why Roy Price does not want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and elects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online where they can watch each free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon gives free things for nothing, do you get too, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are watched by watching this shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you check out what parts you check or check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"you collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show they should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data processing these and this results in the answer, and this reads:" Amazon should make a Sitcom over four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that many of them can remember this show because it wasn't so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve was 7,4, and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so a little above the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy is always looking for this a super-show and he also uses data for it, but he does something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing a competition, he and his team saw the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, which shows them, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use these data to find out these little details about the spectators: which shows them, which producers, what actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a Senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards ". Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competent, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"you connect these many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">"because logic somehow says that, in all, it should work."</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, a decision to meet you, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years to statistics used as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Optimized it through very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good TV, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so, this is something horrifying because we live in a time in which we reach more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good. "</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one is ever in contact with this software. come in touch with this software you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if anyone is here in the USA in prison and for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if any dismissal is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of choosing whether a show is good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"medium-sized television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results generated. this is not that a company such as Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data sealed companies are also false.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it is estimated that through data analysis outbreaks of flu, which can predict -- by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news release. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked flawlessly, year around year until suddenly no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, these errors arise in the decisions of life - at the workplace, in medicine, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computerized genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. I recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be common.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"to set this problem in his individual parts, so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a second place, put the individual parts together to deal with a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and set up again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put together the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is part of the pieces and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, then the information is uncomplete, especially when the brain is an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe it was Netflix so successful because they have used data and understanding where they also belong to the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"you use data to understand their audience better, for what else it would not have been able. but the decision, how to set all these parts again, making it a show like" House of Cards "that doesn't stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision. "</seg>
<seg id="1121">"however, Amazon did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they were competing for TV ideas as they chose" Alpha House "as show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they always could say: "they say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better choices, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are only a tool, and to forget that this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there were data it was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many of them know.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- exactly here in this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll get it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I met some decisions in my life, and I would have to hear the ball in the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much smarter, such as data analysis, to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so, maybe the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. finally, it is on us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that, despite the great amount of data, it is still paying off to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"at the end, it is not the data, but the risks of which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
