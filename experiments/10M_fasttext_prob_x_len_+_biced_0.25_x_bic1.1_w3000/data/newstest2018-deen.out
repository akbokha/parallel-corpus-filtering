&quot; Munich , 1856 : four cards that change your views to the city &quot;
&quot; an ir@@ r@@ ene Anst@@ alt , where you@@ ths should meet today . &quot;
&quot; a tomb , where is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn Tunnel . &quot;
small farmers cultiv@@ ates the impressive reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Mün@@ ch promotes exciting stories about days .
it is annoying when maps are not currently .
&quot; that knows everyone who had already had to be exciting , because the car Nav@@ i instead of a stra@@ pping road instead of a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlas , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as in Bavaria of the state government , are all other than currently - yet very reve@@ aling . &quot;
especially when you compare it with current online cards .
&quot; then , as towns and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bayern Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ep@@ ad that cannot be recognized as such .
&quot; the large over@@ look card were lab@@ elled for cities and communities more detailed maps , so @-@ called urine leaves . &quot;
&quot; these were created according to the Bavarian Sur@@ vey@@ or Administration between 1810 and 1864 , and ski@@ pped the first survey@@ ing of the first survey@@ ing . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
&quot; the French army leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 , during the Second coalition war with Austria . &quot;
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ ern@@ in order - of course to military purposes .
&quot; finally , when French troops moved with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , February 9 , 1801 , it was the present @-@ day neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thereby the Bavarian Sur@@ vey@@ or Administration . &quot;
the Ur@@ positi@@ onal sheet for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like all other at the Bavarian State Library .
&quot; in the early morning / today , the state capital is the most impressive . &quot;
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; one example is sub@@ send@@ ling , which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after preparation of the map , i.e. in 1877 , as the Munich district . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of entrepreneurs are concentrated along the current pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße in 1856 , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bavarian farmers in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where the West@@ park is today , one sees nothing as fields - at the first glance : in the zo@@ oming appears a smaller part card with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten entries from the so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; which was derived from the basic tax . &quot;
&quot; there are no farmers there today , but small hus@@ band@@ men of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green surface is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 was the scene of the October of October , was still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the position of today , one reads in the district of the today district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , only the street names &quot; at the host &quot; or from the height &quot; on the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Irish Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once bul@@ ged people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; there , in 1858 / 59 , the Munich District @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; was created &quot; On Au@@ er Lü@@ ns . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den conducted the establishment - the psychiat@@ rist who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and finished , for example , the chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has prohibited the personnel to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the Anst@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; it was first place for 280 patients , and later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ ren@@ anstalt in Hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; on the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people now meet with the Munich Sal@@ es@@ an@@ um . &quot;
&quot; the Order has acquired the building complex in 1920 , and went into a youth home with training . &quot;
&quot; west is the football field of TS@@ V München East , east of residential houses in the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co , &quot; built in architectural approach to the origins of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was in 1856 as the &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Mün@@ ch .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Allied bombs were cut to the city center in December 1944 . &quot;
a great one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the British Institute , small business houses and a tomb of the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days are working and on 5 April 2017 the sp@@ at@@ enst@@ ich on the second S @-@ Bahn . &quot;
&quot; with the Sli@@ ber@@ eg@@ ler , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;
civil Society publishes it@@ iner@@ aries for Missouri
the National Union to promote Far@@ mers has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling due to discri@@ min@@ ating policies and rac@@ ist attacks in the state after Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Advisory Board is supposed to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ aner , where a number of frag@@ ile , cash @-@ based incident occurred in the entire state and noted here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Missouri , which makes people harder to gain discrimination , as well as the en@@ forcement agencies of the state that de@@ pl@@ ying the Group to admit the di@@ spro@@ uting , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of the civil rights , which people pass . &quot;
&quot; they are recruited because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group cited incid@@ ents such as rac@@ ist crimin@@ als against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , S@@ anders died of un@@ question@@ able circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no petrol more and taken away by the police of Missouri , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also shows a recently published report by the Office of the General At@@ ar@@ ist Office , where it is shown that black motor@@ ists in the state will be 75 percent more frequently than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are consci@@ ously aware and informed about their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
&quot; people must be willing to bring it to the Caucas@@ us , or to know the relatives that they are travelling through the state . &quot;
&quot; Missouri recorded in 2015 in the year 2015 , after the recent figures from the FBI &apos;s ref@@ us@@ al report to the FBI , which in regard to the number of violations of the country &apos;s number of injuries on the 16th number of the country . &quot;
&quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law , which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company because of housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona since the States adopted immigration authorities to forgive people due to immigration , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s view . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings are generally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times the intervention of the measure was deployed to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
reverse @-@ project is essential
the fishing b@@ acher incense project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU / German Parliament Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have produced a picture on site .
&quot; at the right excav@@ ation of the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the fishing ban had met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs . &quot;
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann granted him first insights into his farm , where he offers 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many vir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald &apos;s milk &quot; is for him the aging travel route for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ h@@ est comes exclusively regional .
&quot; since he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ bach , he described the reverse project as &quot; elem@@ ental &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t profit this way steep surfaces .
&quot; green space for plenty of work , much must be processed with the engine sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here with the conditions and to fight top@@ ography , &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann emphas@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ eventh operation and maintained this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not lead bio@@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the meaning of the dec@@ imal project and is happy to promote leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare , the farmers had to be supported . &quot;
&quot; one hope so , that the rest@@ oring of the areas could still be pulled out for a while . &quot;
&quot; the greatest treasure that we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often standing because of promoting criticism in cr@@ iti@@ que
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
&quot; the open area of the open space is 40 hectares , which can be kept up to at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leader was promoted , a quarter wore the municipality of Fis@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the farmers spent 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of Wei@@ fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of f@@ ences , &quot; declared Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a good job , without farmers and women . &quot;
also for Peter White : &quot; the best food produced here . &quot;
the state tax relief ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state support of m@@ f@@ ences .
the aim of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald &apos;s dis@@ closure .
pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the l@@ p@@ r subscri@@ bers .
&quot; in addition , the fenced area should not be in@@ filtr@@ ated ( slope above 35 percent ) and must be threatened with rest@@ oring . &quot;
&quot; for the fishing ban on the fishing project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the open area covers 35 hectares , the resulting cost is over 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is to attack the statues .
&quot; the Americans also appreciate this like any other - therefore the care of Saddam Hussein staged on the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CNN using the proposals for the dra@@ stic restriction on the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller does not handle the statue itself . &quot;
&quot; a hor@@ de of boat be@@ aters and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ers would have vo@@ iced it , if he had done it . &quot;
&quot; but he laid out its significance , and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlighten@@ ed the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you refer to that later was added later , and not part of the original statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is objec@@ tively correct , but as he form@@ ulated himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemp@@ or@@ atory words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the arms of the poor : &quot; your labour , your poor , and your th@@ ron@@ ged masses who continue to breathe freely , / or to breathe out of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ting waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller didn &apos;t engage in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict due to the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who wanted to make her words back to their death on the basis - were very good that they completed a highly political action .
&quot; the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans , showing the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom in a worn classical visual representation . &quot;
&quot; Lazarus changed this importance , in its poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice . &quot;
and there is also a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vism .
&quot; and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change from the right wing this long time . &quot;
&quot; the big scre@@ wing as Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed 2010 that the Statue of Liberty came in , but rather an early Ne@@ oc@@ con@@ serv@@ atives to bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is going forward . &quot;
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not to shine the way into the United States .
&quot; quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh is seen here on something . &quot;
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of perception of perception .
&quot; the great phant@@ as@@ certain@@ ed indeed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ ting , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble vo@@ y@@ ages on the ships of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is in the true sense that the world emerg@@ es from the perspective of people who seek refuge , and make a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
&quot; their statue speaks to them the words of hope , and of the welcome that they have to hear . &quot;
&quot; and that is , of course , not to recognize the perspective , Miller and Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch shall not shine the way , but the hatred that is the only source of power . &quot;
world championship 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ ie Doyle remembers a time when just two Sch@@ ots were to be the team of Great Britain
&quot; the power director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the World Championships were awarded a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athl@@ ete was selected for London in 2017 , which starts on Friday . &quot;
black believes that &quot; in Scotland developed something special &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue to find out until we &apos;ll find out , &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot;
I speak to people in Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they did .
Scottish athl@@ ete think it has something to do with what they did .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the guy at the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several Scottish athl@@ ete are medals candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah while E@@ ili@@ ie Doyle &apos;s team was elected team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling of course brought E@@ ili@@ ie quite natural , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth silver medal winner that will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; unbelie@@ v@@ ably &quot; that 16 Sch@@ ots are in the British crew . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the world championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the middle @-@ stre@@ ak Mu@@ ir performs on this road and has set up five British records last year .
&quot; it will be part of the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another h@@ ote , one after a great season , which took the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Doyle remembers their first world championships when the only other Scot@@ sman was in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the man@@ econom@@ ists say that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also among medals and at the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about to be team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and have chosen me something special for me , &quot; &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise to po@@ dia . &quot;
what my speech affects as a capitalist ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
&quot; so , it is really important to sit on this home support and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion . &quot;
&quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it will be just like a great atmosphere there . &quot;
blocking critics on Facebook : do not compl@@ ain about a public office if you cannot bear the pre@@ heating of voters .
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers killed him for all , from inner policy to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he ch@@ imp@@ lies with the criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; The freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid , and m@@ ute , as sheep are led to the slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland Larry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work with it , to be more like Washington . &quot;
H@@ og@@ ans staff have blocked contributions from at least 450 people and deleted their opinions on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union appe@@ aled him to this week at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the staff of the Governor dismissed the law@@ suit as a fri@@ vol@@ y , and the online comment was full of a counter@@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; many people said . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second @-@ highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is no re@@ ac@@ tionary H@@ itz@@ kopf .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playing his hair @-@ loose head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , blocking of persons who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum , which is considered officially called and of employees working with public tax dollars - unnecessary , and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans Speaker Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse he argu@@ ed the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that blocking the comments are nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too simple to use the images of tro@@ ll@@ ing or sp@@ ouses , or h@@ ass@@ orted people that vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the post spoke with some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no tro@@ ll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments are respec@@ t@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post office and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; attor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ass@@ able , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I said that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hass@@ elt and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news program &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people on the same subject matter , then they are dis@@ counted by some more than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what were the employees of the governor as &quot; concentrated Spam @-@ Attack , &quot; would probably call &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic , or delete a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner than in previous time when you had done the same thing , that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical lad@@ ders and to burn protest@@ ers and silence . &quot;
but exactly that happens right .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials to critic@@ ise that he has critic@@ ised Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is exp@@ elled by Twitter users who have blocked from his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County promised the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , as they proclaimed a voters off their Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had an similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers toler@@ ated between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous counsel@@ ors struck his leadership . &quot;
and even back then Washington had anonymous anonymous .
&quot; the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; wrote , wrote all the letters to newspapers that make Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; Pet@@ ition@@ ing , which crit@@ ici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his position , according to historical documents that were collected by the online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t put them into silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , opinion of expression , and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true guiding means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in Renaissance Club
&quot; the former Europeans n ° 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty , in the next three days , will hope to hope the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led next year to the final round in the field field left to the final round before being lost to Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament amb@@ ass@@ adors in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job as he laid this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great window show@@ case for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as in the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it had won in the year after I had won them , from the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary OR@@ R , who returned to the European Senior tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on the home floor . &quot;
this event will be the first Scottish show since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more if you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to make it well , but you feel also this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed it again and I played a solid Golf .
&quot; I &apos;m glad , as far as it has gone . &quot;
&quot; with the trio on the field the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six sho@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; free entrance fee is free of charge , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a passenger and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , less people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; to this result , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary canc@@ ers are due to passive smoking per year , said study leader Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved his own study on this issue in 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were 400 lung cancer patients due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic connections indicate itself as a very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; are halfway up in time , &quot; says the head of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than presum@@ ed , as the Underground has a lot , which is not indicated in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which is always handic@@ apped , represents a big problem for the Baut@@ ru@@ pp of the St@@ ump@@ p company . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of the drivers in front of red lights and barriers are already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the liner buses are entitled to passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z by the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;

poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner they do not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai rain in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually lays a sweet potato - locally called &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the chim@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; after a half an hour , the dist@@ illed dum@@ b with eager , un@@ washed hands and swallowed up . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - it has no furniture , where she also leads her daily work , such as dresses with d@@ ull water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned any fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course it can be too dangerous to work too : most of the vill@@ ers are unemployed , and many are hard to drink , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; no one is dar@@ ing to stop after 17 : 00 in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the Hochland von Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a disputed referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occupying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which touched for independence against the Dutch rule , turned quickly towards the government of Jak@@ arta , who also maintains control of the region and foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is deser@@ ts . the trip contains a 90 @-@ minute flight from the capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there are no public transportation .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and made of corrugated sheets that were converted by rust in different yel@@ low@@ ish @-@ brown sounds . &quot;
&quot; very few Indonesian had made their journey here , so@@ fter because journalists and practically no fore@@ igner . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , hand @-@ woven Tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ker shirt and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; previously , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is the poorest province of Indonesia where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesian Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and profitable gold mine of the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is situated only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ country province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has min@@ ed in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources valued at an estimated $ 78 billion dollar . &quot;
&quot; however , these wealth are a source of affliction for the Pap@@ ua that ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preser@@ ves presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort had paid local military operations and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ anic demands on greater autonomy thre@@ aten the golden G@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped by the Indonesian military since 1969 , tortured and imprisoned . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ bal country in 1970 @-@ 17 years were used as genocide by the Asia Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; we Bec@@ ome Everything &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane , which included reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year in 2016 , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture ; rape and electro@@ des are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal rainfall is peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week &apos;s incid@@ ents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; screws have intensi@@ fied , because Pap@@ u@@ as resources will bring a source of settlers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development is changing , since Muslim economic stran@@ ts come from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ cant@@ ines sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pean@@ ut sauce served . &quot;
local people are fighting for here .
&quot; the migrants started to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Local in the capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to work . &quot;
it has cost the local Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the Women &#93; of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; during his election campaign 2014 , the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the loc@@ als feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered just two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorbike by the darkness . &quot;
the rock@@ ing children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took part in their tone , and returned with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and beat the group with their guns , said sacrifices and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired in the group &apos;s group .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ates the next day .
&quot; approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered for a football field prior to the local police station and the military service center to demand justice . &quot;
they carried crushed hunting ar@@ ches and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle and a bird @-@ soci@@ ally im@@ iti@@ vely - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago trunk .
some protest@@ ers began to shoot stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command on an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have more than three times of resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; it is said in an official document of TIM@@ E , which has not been released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and demanded the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly got shot in my left wr@@ ist , &quot; &quot; he said TIM@@ E at the porch of his colorful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame always doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cousin , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that it was , &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , like many Indonesian , carries a name , the TIM@@ E in a dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him .
&quot; the Chief Inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said rep@@ orters that his officers wanted their station to &quot; secure &quot; because it will be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people dro@@ ve to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta on the following day .
&quot; in three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate talk in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he had vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for families of victims and sw@@ or to tackle historical ab@@ normal@@ ities in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved instantly , so it will not happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Minister of Security Affairs , Wir@@ anto , said he judge an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historical rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
but the talking started almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must run through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to Jak@@ arta in Jak@@ arta on June 5 and said he didn &apos;t have plans to set a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is legally regulated , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; that demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor &apos;s bloody independence vote , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua have already been buried , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
&quot; families of Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims , contrary to influenza . &quot;
&quot; I was interviewed in the last three years , but there were no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired .
&quot; he says he still lives in fear , years later . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I fear being arrested by the military , are afraid to be shot dead . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
&quot; he says he was defeated by the military after spending four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I was buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the shooting @-@ shops have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a con@@ frontation between the residents and the manager of a be@@ er@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring an un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 year old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ant vill@@ agers prot@@ ested the company &apos;s site .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers , who acted on it by taking warning shots . &quot;
but loc@@ als say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who has been living near the hospital and was witness as the last one has arrived quickly , so the TIM@@ E . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house .
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to withdraw the officers to account@@ ability and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile Brigade of the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an immense covering for the Indonesian government .
&quot; lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ land of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua , forming spor@@ adic attacks and demonstrations of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and arbitr@@ arily arrested in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some are never going up again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for loc@@ als . &quot;
bread is just out of range .
people here building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , each with four or five fields of sweet potatoes . &quot;
&quot; they maintain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
&quot; ten pieces of not@@ a were only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived at the Nab@@ ire airport in larger numbers since the opening of new flight routes . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs , which exist in the region , usually to the better educated and prosp@@ erous migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to perform their own company competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the pan@@ i@@ ai tribe . &quot;
insulation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of reporting international media will be sc@@ anned . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaigns to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development , not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet provinces of Pap@@ ua and West pap@@ ua : visa @-@ ref@@ us@@ al and a black list , &quot; &quot; said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confin@@ ed to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six p@@ aci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia it is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people are wanting to know more foreign governments to know this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura left their silence , and th@@ ron@@ ged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; but according to a source which also participated in the session , but anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say that they probably never agree to Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good int@@ entions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chair@@ woman of the tribe of Directors . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that , is living under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor encour@@ agement and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; who has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want just righteousness , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shot victims brought a final symbolic act of pride : the bodies of a victim was buried on a terrain exactly opposite the police and military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never get justice to them , but at least they have not forgotten their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a direct head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest resi@@ den@@ ces in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story buildings . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that swe@@ eps into only two years through the high @-@ rise , which is called random by the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we were up with fire al@@ arms and when writing people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to come down , &quot; &quot; told a resident named George &apos;s name , Reuters . &quot;
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 hours GMT ) cleared the fire and cool the building .
the government said she has been working on provision of accommodations for those affected .
&quot; the incident can be used to safety of materials , which are used in outdoor areas of buildings around the world , revi@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage caused by the covering , the exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or isolation . &quot;
&quot; in Great Britain , the police said that the system of plates to isolation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a bran@@ ding , with which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) will be pleased with its major Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the Ho @-@ Chi @-@ Minh City , this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single has only been able to play two @-@ thirds majority by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; this is often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set classic remain to the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; therefore , 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the countries agreed for reform , the purpose of IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only scar@@ cely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members don &apos;t have accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of the iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work to improve the competitors .
not until the vote was before many in@@ consisten@@ cies before the proposal came to give the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right next year in the first round of the event .
&quot; to reduce the costs for the promot@@ ers , the requirements for training places etc . facil@@ it@@ ates and players will have to complete the official media dates prior to the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers , forbidden items into the plane , finds a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by Air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent consci@@ ously identified or un@@ consci@@ ously banned objects to the control points of US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which rates the plane while they accid@@ entally prohibited knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed they would have discovered that they had travelled ir@@ r@@ assed with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey carried out more than 1,000 persons - which was carried out by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger trav@@ ellers rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; by those surveyed said they knew that they were wi@@ el@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were banned . &quot;
&quot; the most common objects that were worn by T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 per cent said that they have borne objects with clin@@ ches through the security control , while 2.2 percent of female surveyed and 3.7 percent of the male respondents have confirmed that they had been deliberately banned drugs in the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said that I have asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many accid@@ entally sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware had brought by airport security , and how many would have been deliberately done . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people , most likely to bear sm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware - knowing or un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly - through the safety , those who were most frequently flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company shows that the T@@ SA direc@@ tives is something complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uncertain which liquids are allowed to take away or how much of it .
&quot; so , there is no surprise that the largest quantity of the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated objects are prohibited . &quot;
&quot; for a time , the people , the T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ad@@ ware . &quot;
liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla &apos;s customers cancel order
electro @-@ thou@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gives the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; so far , he has previously signed that some of the customers have already withdrawn their un@@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always triumph@@ al numbers of sales increases and more gigantic target , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k is the first to betra@@ y another , less gl@@ anced number : the cancell@@ ations on the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in the past few months , Mus@@ k had applied in the new car with more than 500.000 pre @-@ provisions for the new car . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k is a : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders a total of 6@@ 3,000 were already withdrawn again . &quot;
&quot; critics were always pointed out again , that it is only for binding reservations . &quot;
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tesla pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) . &quot;
&quot; at present 45@@ ,000 of such un@@ binding reservations , Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts at present . &quot;
&quot; however , the cancellation of so far around twelve percent of all orders could be problem , however , the Tesla boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models are supposed to be combined - 500,000 will be one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations per day . &quot;
&quot; who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; may be ordered at the earliest in the second half of 2018 , when Tesla manages to drive his brand new , never in practice tested output roads with maximum load . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to larger del@@ ays , then the in@@ committ@@ ment of reservations could become a problem for Tesla . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company can &apos;t dis@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ pping in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt moves to reduction of the rules of Obama &apos;s rules to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott took P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Authority to delay his previous decision to reduce the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smoke @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency turned to the needs of state environmental authorities , compared to previous administr@@ ations . &quot;
he didn &apos;t notice the law@@ suit against his previous place in a Federal Constitutional Court .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which expired on 1 October for states to comply with the zone of Oz@@ on in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would be hes@@ it@@ ating to comply with his authority to study more time to study the plan and prevent economic growth in local decisions , or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prior to his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney General of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent of demanding environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly refused to block regul@@ ators or delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the youngest legal set@@ back to the P@@ ru@@ ptions regul@@ at@@ al @-@ agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Constitutional Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas company for monitoring and reducing meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks to delay . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt submitted his opinion on o@@ zone standards just the read@@ iness of EPA to co @-@ operation with the states due to the complex process of the new standards ampli@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often did not hold the dead@@ lines for carrying out groups and then waiting for implementing activist groups and others , and said in an agreement the appointment for execution , &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation by judicial procedures , and we accept dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also accept the law and authority , who gives us seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of EPA stated that P@@ ru@@ itt will take advantage of its &quot; powers to delay and all other legally available to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; one in the last month of approval bill , the implementation of the 2015 rules should be delayed by at least eight years . &quot;
the measure was not yet made in the Senate .

Tum@@ lingen will celebrate 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ Church , on Sunday 16th July , at 16.@@ 30 am invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether his id@@ yl@@ lic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth benefit Ser@@ en@@ ade can con@@ j@@ ure themselves from this powerful place .
rescue and preser@@ vation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and convey@@ ing tum@@ ors for their int@@ entions .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ ate sm@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in the Württem@@ berg@@ buch : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the known parish church of Tum@@ our and the Vos@@ ges of Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard from Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
according to the certificate according to the certificate of certificate on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a scenic court to which the church or the patron was right and not vice versa .
so there were people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , in addition to the sub@@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the outskirts of Tum@@ our , the &quot; Berg &quot; is the third , the magnificent municipal core of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 sub@@ str@@ ates these historical haz@@ ards .
the patron was originated from the early medieval owner .
&quot; one Lord , who built a church , equi@@ val@@ ed and possessed with a priest , continued his own church , and could also inherit these own people . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the right was to use a priest , or to propose the bishop a new priest . &quot;
three alt@@ ars were in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greatest of the two sm@@ iling at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly purchased bell was first performed in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the window were shot and st@@ ole the bell . &quot;
the roof was in@@ den@@ sely .
in 1796 French troops en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church bells and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened in 1809 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius gra@@ vey@@ ard served as the last resting place for the dead . &quot;
in 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the storm stood up .
&quot; in the New Year of 1834 , a storm spread the storm and the half r@@ ushed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demolished . &quot;
only the existing tower @-@ wer@@ g today remained as the witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ eph@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em by the &quot; creative pension@@ ers &quot; as a successor to Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system . &quot;
&quot; as a promot@@ er the friends and sponsors of tum@@ ours on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery on the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; this is designed by com@@ bo of Kepler Gym@@ n@@ asi@@ um Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with word contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler , Rein@@ hold Matt@@ ice . &quot;
the outskirts of Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program kicks off at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 a.m .
&quot; to the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk was held before the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; the organizers provide fantastic views . &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers hopes for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is important for tum@@ ors and listening . &quot;
the friends and sponsors of tum@@ ours feel particularly committed to home care such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ med .
club wants to test permission of Win@@ dr@@ yers
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ ars itself , &quot; no legal foundation for the construction and has therefore turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ avers &quot; has been asked to take refuge for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the club argu@@ ed that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 , at the time of the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in four , only at the border crossing of Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal , there exists a wind force concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy systems are generally possible , at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind power supplies for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; in landscape .
&quot; a few days before , the town had decided a second wind concentration camp in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the city council of Düsseldorf has not approved , because of a form of form . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval must be un@@ lawful and therefore declined , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of things : the city council once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , a approval of the District government is still standing . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; thus , the issu@@ ance of approval for the construction of wind energy systems are legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; the corresponding writing have received a spokes@@ man for the past week since the past week , &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them on the occasion to review the matter again .
but they are likely to carry out that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; with a view on ongoing procedures at the administrative court , the circle did not want to content himself with the development of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette to build the construction of four each 200 meters high win@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , which was involved in the city of Vier@@ sen , had been involved with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large @-@ site . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of four wind energy plants , electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - this is equivalent to approximately one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ powered households . &quot;
the NEW re plans to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , there was a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ nich near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind energy facility in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
&quot; car and tractor , together : woman dies in terrible accident &quot;
a terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 333 between low @-@ ashes and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn district ) .
a woman was wounded fatal .
two more people were slightly injured .
the state road remained blocked over hours .
&quot; following police survey , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ nich was carried out with their passenger car as part of the accompanying driver with her 53 year old mother as accompanying person the L 333 towards the Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and distributors plan &quot; homeland Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
bath Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to discover the shopping spots in the city in September .
the business club and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th in order to attract the inhabitants to the city center .
&quot; as the Chairman of the Trade Association , Christian König , proclaimed the &quot; Home Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend , the &quot; Home Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend will experience its customers that offers the own city away from the usual supermarket @-@ commodity . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies should present themselves with their training positions . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the shops of the city center will be loaded to &quot; mit@@ ter@@ night @-@ shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the promotion is not only in the residents of the city and the region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation for advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that refer to the weekend @-@ weekend , Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and commercial club co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
the business club and the city will go into another stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive Centre . &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; for the Brun@@ n@@ en@@ fest and sal@@ es@@ ful Sunday , talks with all business operators and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
there are also attractive offers on Saturday and public parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential may be new or re @-@ opened . &quot;
&quot; in addition , courses and tourists belong . &quot;
but many natives have lost the city center shopping from a glance .
&quot; at the end , all of them contribute to revi@@ ve the city center - to land@@ lords , all over the city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was to overcome with a network to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y that had spread over , the king had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Mü@@ hl@@ hausen , Germany announced that five Thuring@@ ian cities were participating in the nationwide third &quot; home country @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , So@@ cho@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; &quot; be stronger for the appreciation of local trade and its meaning for the Common of our Cities &quot; , &quot; I stri@@ ve . &quot;
the action below the I@@ HK and with many partners are also clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment in its terms .

Tr@@ ump set after tran@@ scri@@ ded tran@@ scription of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts by phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to publicly tell that he would not pay for a planned wall . &quot;
&quot; the US President imp@@ rec@@ ted him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to report , he said to him : &quot; you cannot tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and gay , Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first address with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull has also been published and revealed a che@@ ered exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the United States refugees to take over Australia , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was medi@@ ated by the government Obama would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump completed the call , after he had said to the Lord Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most un@@ pleasant call for all day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists guide rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for righteousness
&quot; a 1948 @-@ based Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to Moore &apos;s Ford bridge . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver , the bridge could reach the bridge , a group of white men with guns emerged to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a man middle age in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous suit - took a long train to his cig@@ ar and looked after testing through the wind@@ shield .
inside sha@@ ves the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ ared the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; scre@@ ams , when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a post . &quot;
&quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; nearly all in the audience is very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , Citi@@ zen returns to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - from the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was accused of murder .
&quot; it is really un@@ question@@ able , that in all these years no one person was arrested - even though we see them in our communities , even though we know who they are , &quot; &quot; Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks said that during the organisation &apos;s organisation . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights .
&quot; for him , the follow @-@ up as a dramatic appeal for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community , that an in@@ justice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosec@@ uting , we want to end , we want healing , we want to be reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot come to cure and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a court agent puts a beg@@ gar of a beg@@ gar of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI Ak@@ ten , which were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were suspected of Monroe and the surrounding villages in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but no one has ever been indicted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the open since decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always well @-@ known : Politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizens to be held for the first time in Georgia for the first time in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the FBI of black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ kind H@@ ester , during a struggle - supposedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Bro@@ oks said that rum@@ our was in the city that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore them , not of her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from the prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her Cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
&quot; but when she came down from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , surrounded by a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b . &quot;
&quot; as it turned out , it was Harrison who has prepared and ordered the Mor@@ de , conclu@@ des from a FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local criminal prosecution that was not only involved in killing , evidence and identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks make it more pre@@ gn@@ ant .
&quot; it was an electoral massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed , to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you vote , and if you vote , you will happen to you here . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual follow @-@ up of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; her representation is illustr@@ ative , moving , and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believed that he doesn &apos;t exist in America . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to watch and see more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we are confron@@ ted with its hem@@ at@@ ern@@ ity in us all , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to listen to what I &apos;ve done . &quot;
&quot; the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - entered into a room and listen , when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
&quot; he played the role of Chef @-@ Cl@@ an@@ mit@@ ds for years , but he said , the role will never be simpler . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a tried to play with Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ kind H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester cri@@ es and be@@ ating it , ra@@ ged that he slept with Dor@@ othy with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , w@@ ishing from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a replies to fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the loud voice .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , he said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ wning . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ched one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the energy in space , a feeling of camera ship replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this correctly , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene once again begins .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharp and with a re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and quickly .
&quot; there is scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman clothed with a funeral dress , stands on the cor@@ p@@ ses of actors and will deliver cheap Holidays &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks every second word .
&quot; about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators and tears came out of their eyes . &quot;
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come only down the street . &quot;
&quot; they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as op@@ pres@@ sive humidity , when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; until this point the murders have stayed an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels like . &quot;
&quot; when the final notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspec@@ t the body name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cks on their heads , record the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing one another . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , mur@@ m@@ ur a little boy when he wants to remember . &quot;
&quot; after several minutes , Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it is over . &quot;
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ x arrow and wi@@ pe her tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ced Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the Cl@@ an@@ member has played . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ced two of his players and breaks through their arms , and the emotional load of the performance finally falls with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for one reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience sets together with the actors to dinner together . &quot;
&quot; at a table , a white pair of Atlanta stim@@ ulated a white pair with a black pair , which they had just met . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words , which feeling the performance of the performance . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to hear this terrible words and deeds ... of people coming from people who look like yourself and what they do , as you look like , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what it really does with me , makes me believe that the Lyn@@ chen is still going on , &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; today the only police @-@ shooting is called . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks dwelt at his table , he eats and reminds of civil rights . &quot;
&quot; he said , he already started to plan the performance in the next year . &quot;
&quot; the post is inspir@@ ational in a certain way , because it describes the fear of what we suffer , but there is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who doesn &apos;t know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ us@@ k &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental works , director Frank Cast@@ orf is based on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e Ins@@ ulation before a gigantic , six @-@ story back@@ drop . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows an optional road corner with the wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine sc@@ ans pose as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an is@@ etta . &quot;
pil@@ oted oil barrels remember Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - that is moving through his &quot; ring &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three pillars - sung by Stephanie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke L@@ mid@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they execute the Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , a ser@@ ene in Hollywood @-@ man@@ ier and give a rental in the trunk and give the cre@@ wall@@ o Cli@@ que . &quot;

the audience thanks to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .

&quot; there is great appl@@ ause for the Fest@@ spiel@@ haus , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the great heat back to empty recreational clothing . &quot;
the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ am was eag@@ erly anticipated .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to be able to have a great whi@@ st@@ le concert in 2013 , there were five years later great ju@@ bel in which the single &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to be happy about this .
&quot; you know that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain manner , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also a understanding of its visibility . &quot;
I prefer a positive result .

where to everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in stone furt in the furniture exchange , once a week I am working here in Gre@@ ven , the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked in the open whole day at school .
how are your experiences yet ?
&quot; quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide range that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with juven@@ iles , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late professional volunteer . &quot;
how does that come from ?
quantity : I have taken a high school .
&quot; and then a engineer study , let &apos;s say , successfully broken . &quot;
I knew that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
&quot; a social year , as there is a gli@@ mp@@ se , there you can see how it is on site , in the burning point , perhaps , really . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual @-@ study , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker training and education in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule . &quot;
is it not unusual when the volunteers have several different applications ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where you will be FS@@ J .
you can make it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; in the afternoon I was partly in the afternoon , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ates me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
unlike the construction engineer ?
&quot; quantity : sure , here it is not about to count ex@@ tras . &quot;
&quot; one has always left other people , each of which have a very different story behind them . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee has been picked up , whether a young man who has been picked up out of the family - it must always be done individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is a area that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , plenty of kindness . &quot;

EPA Ret@@ rie@@ ve Dec@@ ision to Del@@ aying the Smo@@ g Rule according to Kl@@ agen
&quot; U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has made a decision to delay the government regulation of Obama , confir@@ ming that the states are obliged to re@@ com@@ end the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 States accused the agency due to the step@@ ping . &quot;
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; and said they show the agency obligation to collabor@@ ate with states .
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA that the o@@ zone provisions - in which in part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions are to be determined to determine where sub@@ sections have to be taken to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint , and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to im@@ pose a wide range of environmental issues , which is imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda , which should stim@@ ulate economic growth according to tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have caused the response of Democrats and nature reserves that concerns about the effects of greater emissions to public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and reduce the respiratory system , such as As@@ thma . &quot;
community wants to be common room
&quot; at the end , the decision was clear : in two objects , the Municipal Council decides to set up the establishment of a common area in the future senior citizens . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing basic piece was signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it is still going to last , until the so far the church of the church is in the community , there is no planning solution for the more secure project by a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a common space .
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , offered to meet the community . &quot;
on the ground floor he would provide a living space - about 55 square meters and a adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space available for a special price .
&quot; the administration and the majority of the community float , such a common room not just as a meeting point for the residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ righteous residential , but openly to the church . &quot;
&quot; for example , the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision to be sent by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided in autumn , through the provision of funding . &quot;
construction is located in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common area would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , accounting for 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the decision to sign@@ alize the investor , to sign@@ alize the investor from him in this respect , that both artic@@ ulations - which reduces both artic@@ ulations - what is reduced to the environment and construction of economic power - it would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so does not only Wil@@ fried So@@ h@@ mer , be this addition . &quot;
if it helps : unanimously he passes the panel .
it is not so easy with the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings , with which one comes not so right now , for the common room in the window , she says : &quot; I do so hard to do it . &quot; &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger speaks to the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
she sees behind it a conce@@ aled sub@@ sid@@ y at once @-@ held assets or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the area you do not give a supplement but get a real , in the case of doubt , the counter@@ acts is . &quot;
&quot; the Sta@@ ig@@ ator proposal to split the decision in accordance with the decision , finds three pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; with two objects in the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises this : &quot; if we deal with the decision , we make a huge step into our infrastructure . &quot;

walking to Star in Har@@ z
&quot; in Har@@ z , the nationwide first &quot; star trail &quot; will be created . &quot;
this plan is planning the club ob@@ servatory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet road in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; an &quot; star trail &quot; comes to the information needs of many har@@ bors , it was called . &quot;
&quot; he respon@@ ds to nature , science , exercise , and sporty performance . &quot;
the members want to asc@@ end along the planned route tables and inform about stars and stars .
&quot; in a first phase to 2018 , the association plans to reach &quot; well @-@ reaching installations in five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; in@@ quire St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ er , Hoh@@ enz@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the tablets are to be completed by Internet .
this is why the site selection includes a good mobile network reception .
accessibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star trail should be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ path , the viewer experienced a great deal of knowledge , for example , about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; stated the club . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars have different colors , or why a star greater light than another , although it &apos;s much further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which constellation can be seen a selected star , and when he was best to see . &quot;
&quot; the club has been operating since 2014 in the town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is the highest located ob@@ servatory in northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal National Park , the site of Har@@ z National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
frequently there are clearly visible from the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ meda Galaxy with naked eye .
&quot; in the University of Germany , there has been something similar to the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Go@@ arium initiative since 2003 , something similar to the planned star of the planet . &quot;
&quot; starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the inside of our solar system , the planet road leads up to Hain@@ berg and to ob@@ servatory - as well as an alien &apos; outside location in Di@@ emar@@ den ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ elen with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf plan@@ ed P@@ lu@@ to at the end point , are placed exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion . &quot;
&quot; the earth shr@@ ink so on a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away , the sun measures 70 centi@@ meters . &quot;
the planet &apos;s total distance is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light takes about eight hours to P@@ lu@@ to for about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour until St@@ ele with P@@ lu@@ to . &quot;
&quot; therefore , pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than light in the world . &quot;
but the march on the next fixed star would take another one year .
Mik@@ ey Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia , who should stand in a coll@@ ision course to stage the most exciting boxing battle in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;

&quot; when the couple was pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko &apos;s Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show @-@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order &quot; . &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; remembered Garcia . &quot;
&quot; I went up for bronze &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to go on light weight .
&quot; and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; , and then we fight . &quot;
the fans demand the fans .
let &apos;s give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed to .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
&quot; the climate asked whether it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that must fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year to make an appointment in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell following their light weight title in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this battle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans asked after him , &quot; &quot; said Garcia and pressed later to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Garcia said he would like to join Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; a massive fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday struggle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he think , the tri@@ athlon champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side look very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to do the Ko @-@ From . &quot;
&quot; Garcia said , the focus is to show impact strength , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said they could feel the moment@@ um , which was built for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the battle that must be performed .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work , &quot; &quot; said Garcia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; I have waited for top fighters , and this is Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire plat@@ ters
&quot; at an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost the control of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16,@@ 30 shortly before joining the market , presumably the control of his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the car to@@ wed to the right to the vill@@ ain , where he over@@ threw himself and then lie on the roof of the grass tyres . &quot;
four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were badly damaged during the accident .
&quot; during the first care of the injured service , A7 was locked towards the north for approximately one hour , then traffic on the left lane could be led by the accident site . &quot;
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
&quot; after 2 : 2 of the season open@@ er , Andre Hoffmann is hoping that the optimization of the def@@ ences in Au@@ e scored points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of season , Andre Hoffmann was happy with the result , there would not be the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these two opponents were too much , and we have to watch in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Erz@@ gebirge , the thres@@ hing chain should also be optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a free fall , the Fort@@ unas do not want more . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) introduces the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team also comes better after the experience in preparation with the tri@@ m@@ chain , than with the four @-@ erk@@ raut . &quot;
&quot; still , I don &apos;t know how we are acting in Au@@ e , &quot; says his train@@ ers Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we are just in the three @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build good , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; requirement is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ious , and we cannot afford such a lot of time errors . &quot;
&quot; of course Hoffmann will also ride to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; however , if one cannot speak after a mis@@ guided start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could well be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; if we are on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a regular season open@@ er . &quot;
but his coach did not want to know anything .
&quot; the start into the season I only do after six to eight days , &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game was cancelled due to the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann believes that the players from Au@@ e might even be something fresh because they couldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una with a ascension into the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the defense of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; indeed , guests from the Rhineland , as a lighter favorite on Sunday to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we go away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; says Fun@@ kel , whose balance is quite positive with just one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there are no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one must strike from before , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Chef coach . &quot;
&quot; to meet such a statement , arro@@ gant and super@@ se@@ eable . &quot;
&quot; and so , Fun@@ kel will not experience his players on Sunday . &quot;
new results of the Swedish asylum evaluation tests published
&quot; the latest results of testing for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( puzzles ) has begun with the tests of tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they are supposed to be more precise to the assessment of the age after the Swedish migration authority ( migration ) due to lack of trouble during the correct age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ r@@ ational has shipped 6.@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results from a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 . &quot;
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older during more than 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency admitted that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is asked .
&quot; according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson , from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , results in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we see no major difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are rather constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person has been judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers has been lied to over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that we propose to propose that the examined person was 18 years old or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ adet revealed the results of the 5@@ 81 results , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that it will be 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , which are made by the x @-@ ray shots of white teeth and MRI images of knee joints , which then crit@@ ici@@ zed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also crit@@ ici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus de Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institut , whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of biological maturity of people to see whether they were sooner or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used . &quot;
the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do so as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of judge a child is in@@ correct . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the three bridges on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are well ahead .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven ton of concrete structure was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , building manager at the Department of Road and Transport at the Government of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , work began on all three san@@ itation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is scheduled for October and it is safe that the schedule will be kept .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete , lined with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein , and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , she has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and safety stability , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges run over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven ton heavy so @-@ called bridge folder on Wednesday morning .
this is a boundary that is also used as a factory track .
the southern part of the bridge should be used on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge folder .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way went away .
&quot; the particular part is that there are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented spectac@@ le .
special finger@@ tip has the wiring of lines required by the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a glass fibre cable , which many companies are connected . &quot;
the natives were informed of the work by hand@@ books on the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and cru@@ st@@ ace@@ ans had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for bridges between the farm buildings and the gathering in direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is controlled by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction of the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; was closed . &quot;
&quot; the cost of three bridge alloys are amount to 700 000 euros together . &quot;
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ ol@@ stein in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : bear in protest with German potato sal@@ at
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter so frequently that parties are pulling on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , everything else is hard to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows a large alliance to this day because the Af@@ D takes place in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell for a large election campaign . &quot;
&quot; and known as Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , together with Alexander G@@ land , forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy chief Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are already standing before the beginning of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D writers , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the town @-@ pic@@ nic is planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ n@@ en@@ platz , but now finds on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus just before the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colourful picture that offers itself .
&quot; what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the Forum One World and one of the relevant organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; German potato sal@@ at who could eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him with . &quot;
&quot; the police opened a lot of civil servants according to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence in particular also at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ D Vol@@ can@@ ine fel to recru@@ it such an event and get the supplement for such an event .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had previously asked in Dau@@ n , but there was not a cancellation because of the already built @-@ built foli@@ r@@ enti@@ mes , not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; with a view to the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz he says , &quot; This is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; it also does : at about 20 o &apos;clock the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , among them the Rhineland @-@ p@@ fal@@ ical Af@@ D @-@ President Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the hall , about 200 listen@@ ers who wait for the Bundestag to wait for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch hold their speech@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet night . &quot;
&quot; a little more than one hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the premises have a longer breath , but also there is scheduled for a short time after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can back down - no special privileg@@ es .

both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and awar@@ de@@ es of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top not@@ ers .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SWR Symphony Orchestra of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both un@@ ites the desire to pass not only the limits on their instruments , but also merge the limits of different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach on both like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combines himself with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz collector N@@ ils W@@ rist , mix classic , jazz and free games to a fascinating artwork . &quot;
this core of the program was first premiered in Freiburg with huge success in Freiburg .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese , and they will eat it until the end of their life . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try everything , so Kri@@ sten Stewart openly about her bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; when I bite the grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; -@@ colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson who finally broke out in the end .
&quot; in spite of all the brunette actress compared to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love seriously , whom I wanted . &quot;
or do you think about it ? I would have played it ?
&quot; after its separation , Kri@@ sten said she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered me .
I never liked it yet to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; she especially suffered them to &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but in school time , when she was rather disgu@@ ised as a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b . &quot;
&quot; I felt really attacked , sc@@ ary and ashamed . &quot;
now I look back and think myself : &apos; girls &apos; be proud of you ! &apos; .
&quot; it is especially important to the public , they don &apos;t like to love their love life : &quot; people expect you to be a certain way and anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and maybe , some of them describe me , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from all the public . &quot;
West Virginia Governor tells us that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; if you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much more thoughts ... today I &apos;ll tell you as a inhabitants of West Virginia , I cannot help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement at the West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice weren &apos;t the democratic can@@ did@@ acy to Hillary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; according to Forbes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , Justice was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; it states that he possesses coal plants in five states , and has inherited a coal business from his father . &quot;
it is worth € 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republican National Committee on Thursday night announced a declaration in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party who would rather hin@@ der ourselves to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Gou@@ vern@@ s and the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of governor Justice , only the last re@@ jection of a party , which is from the top to bottom , is not able to find a positive , consistent message , said the R@@ NC @-@ Chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel said in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; Hon@@ ored &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for D@@ oping sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised the Thursday , which he described as an open ap@@ ology from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport . &quot;
Russian Athle@@ tics chef Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of Athle@@ tics Championships that the prohib@@ itions of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight D@@ oping .
&quot; he said , sorry for &quot; all athletes who were taken away in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for maintaining the ban , which was executed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the rep@@ orters . &quot;
&quot; the whole Council and the entire congress were delighted about the Russian Federation in itself , that it has experienced some quite hot times and everything is possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; in addition , CO@@ E said that Russia is also pleased to accept the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think it was made progress , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the principal principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes of the dried system , &quot; &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes are competing in the athle@@ tics world championships , which will start on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , Russia &apos;s head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still in@@ sufficient and prohibited train@@ ers are still free , he said rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
funeral for in Mali with tragedy
&quot; in a funeral service at the North @-@ edi@@ an Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1,000 people have thought the soldiers who were surrounded by a helicopter in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
the Minister of Defence from the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing .
they described the two ent@@ an@@ ted pilots but the &quot; C@@ ould of her Fach@@ s . &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest victims , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old merchant from Nord@@ h@@ essen had come to life on Wednesday before a week in the West African Mali .
their cords were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a tot@@ ality of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
&quot; at noon on noon , only the families were left in the church . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , by representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot;
&quot; including H@@ ess@@ ens , Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the general inspection of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; Sad@@ ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , and the families were arm in arm in arms . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
Minister of Defense from the Le@@ yen described the um@@ ber@@ ed soldiers &apos; high decorated and in@@ treated .
the Stab@@ ili@@ mann appointed the air operation of the helicopter air@@ man Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar where he had been one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regim@@ ents .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent , who belong to the soldiers , stated : &quot; if these crew could not turn away the crash , there was no one . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali was not demonstrated by the Le@@ yen : it is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; for a country , from which we are separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral service , the S@@ är@@ ge were brought to the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are att@@ acking , the Bundes@@ wehr did not have any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried in his wife beside his wife . &quot;
that shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen was understood with the decision of her husband . he was further named in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried there is still un@@ clear .
but he does not have the intention to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never had a H@@ eh@@ l of it that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the thr@@ ill of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to be king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired to reti@@ re and sets the title &quot; prin@@ cess@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark does not have the title and function , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - also not after death , stated L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish king &apos;s house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; but he does not have the intention to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; the born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ oc@@ racy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
&quot; on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy . &quot;
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ iz@@ ations of the people always flew up , Prince Hen@@ rik , in his almost 50 years , had a serious stand at the Dan@@ en . &quot;
&quot; in a Auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did , critic@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was sw@@ ank@@ ingly , I preferred wine instead of beer , so@@ cks instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ od , which I smoke in instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and who had the call to be the brand social intellectual intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were equal to two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants to get a quick new election .
CDU and F@@ DP in front of any majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after losing the red @-@ green government &apos;s loss for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to re@@ sign . &quot;
&quot; because , on Friday , the dis@@ solution of the Parliament spoke . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising number of the Green Socialists in Lower Saxony in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the Land@@ mark Law , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ votes majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Green Party El@@ ke T@@ wins founded her step with the non @-@ nomin@@ ation for the 2018 election in Rot@@ ch@@ â@@ tel ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she explained in Hannover on Friday . &quot;
the CDU Group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to his faction to record them .
&quot; thus , CDU and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; so far , the ratio was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new country day is re@@ elected to be regular at the 14th of January .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green national government must decide if they could move in this situation without majority .
&quot; Stephan Weil holds it , however , that the country &apos;s day decides to rapidly decide its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CDU faction is expected to decide on Tuesday on Tuesday .
&quot; the state association also sees the opportunity , that the country &apos;s day , the prime minister , cho@@ oses the trust and cho@@ oses a successor . &quot;
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
&quot; these possibilities must be legally reviewed , &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said . &quot;
&quot; one will discuss all the questions , when they are legally tested . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler named T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but a bit cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the polit@@ ician herself stressed : &quot; I am not a betra@@ yer .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described themselves as a tag of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the ab@@ rupt Euro MPs on the return of their country &apos;s day .
&quot; we assume , of course , that it has received their everyday life , which she has received over the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; shared the state @-@ president of a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
the Group president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ IEL said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ wins . &quot;
she deliberately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; in front of the background , that there was no in@@ lasting differences , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot;
&quot; in Martin Schulz , SPD @-@ Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the leader of the Lower Saxony @-@ MPs El@@ ke T@@ wins to the CDU as betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; the behavior of the former Green members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re @-@ elect the country &apos;s day .
the Austr@@ o @-@ west@@ ens cost Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony is the majority .
&quot; in her mis@@ ery and in her fr@@ ust their personal interests in their mis@@ chief , the SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus has critic@@ ised for their personal interests . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ tri@@ ght game and tried to beat out of this political capital .
&quot; the CDU @-@ fac@@ tional leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to suggest his dep@@ uties , El@@ ke T@@ wins into the CDU . &quot;
&quot; the SPD head of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ ys , with personal career thinking the result of the 2013 Land@@ mark Law . &quot;
&quot; the CDU was the strongest force in front of the SPD , but the SPD and Green Party had a very thin majority in the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect us from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ ers , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany disc@@ usses on contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview in the interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr Schmidt : how can the consumer protect from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; I can only encourage all the consumer and consumers , to check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the st@@ amping pressures . &quot;
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery stores , the German states represent the latest information on the affected eggs . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , after all we know , health haz@@ ards are practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs run out of the offer , because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the Federal Minister is not truly perceived ? &quot;
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately shut up immediately and has been in connection with the authorities of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; trade has just like the manufacturers to worry , that the sold products sold products and health are un@@ imagin@@ able . &quot;
&quot; if with eggs the back@@ rest content of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not possible . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time not the agrit@@ uris@@ mi to blame .
are manufacturing plants and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current knowledge , production plants meets no direct debt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they have to expect an illegal illeg@@ itim@@ ate practices of services with economic damage . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the harvest . &quot;
is it missing only by the staff or even at the sl@@ anting competence ?
&quot; however , it was just the official controls which have exposed the process . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth belongs , however , that food fraud and criminal energy should never be made up to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; precisely because of this , a consequ@@ ent recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of such events and the hand@@ ing over to the cases in the cases where criminal off@@ ences are present , of crucial importance . &quot;
I have already made several times much that I expect from the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm system really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively secure and busy food . &quot;
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry is used , consumer and consumer are dis@@ rup@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; producers , tra@@ ders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ ds Fi@@ on@@ il in the attitude of viable animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
it must be consistently working on all levels and with high @-@ pressure .
&quot; I expect from all relevant authorities , that the fact that the atomic fact is po@@ or@@ ly explained . &quot;
how the financial rules of the football to Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to prevent enormous expenses of the European football matches , Ne@@ ym@@ ars world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain are not b@@ other@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain for UEFA , because the leading organization , which monitors the European game , has the power to offer teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair @-@ Play rules given by the UEFA in 2011 , mean that PS@@ G has to point out at some point that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without great losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid $ 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian population from its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make money really loose with security , so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar taught him and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy @-@ rich ruler of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may need a lot of money for the purchase of players , but need to control them with legitim@@ ate entries , which allow them the break @-@ even point in its place on football @-@ related business . &quot;
&quot; FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini , following his election to the UEFA President in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; former French player believed that clubs that had enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ ked to ru@@ e when banks or owner moved their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentration to the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ o@@ vich was originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then strong invested to build the team and to build a global brand - to a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of up to 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and even though Plat@@ ini in 2015 is fallen by the presidency in Un@@ le@@ nade , his UEFA successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to deter them from excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; certainly is FF@@ P not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press in the last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for the invoice about the duration of his contract . &quot;
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract to be signed for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the financial statements .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 gave the PS@@ G with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G was reduced to € 60 million ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the teams for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season on 21 players will be limited to 21 players . &quot;
&quot; UEFA is searching for clubs , who could try to list their financing results , by providing their income by companies that are associated with owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ ic company could spon@@ ges the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEFA would not apply as legitim@@ ate income . &quot;
&quot; that happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ings of the PSA of Qatar Tourism Authority has been blo@@ wn up . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G @-@ payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar will arrive on payments from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar , 2022 , have fought that Ne@@ ym@@ ar WM amb@@ ass@@ adors will be easy to find out for UEFA regulatory authorities . &quot;
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEFA has yet to be attentive , any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEFA had no priority conversations with PS@@ G on Ne@@ ym@@ ars Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they said under the condition of An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not fug@@ iti@@ ed to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
&quot; the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million , generating a profit of more than 10 million euros . &quot;
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
&quot; PS@@ G is anticipated that Ne@@ ym@@ ars arrive a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing @-@ De@@ als , Mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ cot . &quot;
the club assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 per cent after the signing of the signature .
&quot; the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she attempted to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ ars depart@@ ing , claiming that PS@@ G viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financed d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the State , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in regards to Kat@@ ars last owner at PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal &apos;s Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that co @-@ financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play , because you can find different ways or different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ raffe in search of a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ants
&quot; in recent years , choc@@ ol@@ ate Fre@@ y board choc@@ ol@@ ates choc@@ ol@@ ates for the Swiss . &quot;
&quot; now , the cooperation is now in front of a possible end : the airline writes the order . &quot;
Swiss @-@ speaking Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request of news agency S@@ DA an appropriate report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ z &quot; from Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will take a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be reviewed all two to three years and subjected to a quality control .
&quot; with the current vendor Chocol@@ ate Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; around 17 million small bay plates of 14 grams spread over 14 grams per year , in front of landing to passengers . &quot;
&quot; over the cost , the Swiss wanted to do no information . &quot;
industry experts estimate the order volume according to &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schwei@@ z &quot; to 1.5 @-@ 2 million Swiss francs - the mig@@ rant daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more import@@ antly is all advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ver .
&quot; like many applicants on the new tender , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y Swiss . &quot;
but in question only Swiss manufacturers are coming .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Chocol@@ ate Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the contract by the spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturers was not achie@@ vable for a statement . &quot;
&quot; on board their flights , chocolate boards have been on board their flights since 2006 . &quot;
&quot; before Swiss had completed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;
&quot; the possibility to place the logo , Swiss conducted two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocol@@ ate Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ distance flights the customers of the First Class with treats from the conf@@ ection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gl@@ i are p@@ am@@ pered in the business class n@@ aps passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lin@@ dt and Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Chocol@@ ate Fre@@ y .

nostal@@ gia goes in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repet@@ ition of history is nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ year @-@ gra@@ unge era ( as the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ ot the Sk@@ etch @-@ com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to larger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bo@@ diment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era . &quot;
&quot; however , as fran@@ chise it feels like this would be the time . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his absurd human hum@@ ors ( it contained a original history for a speaking tin of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by taking part in the core of the G@@ ags , actors play middle age , children , who will grow up - do they still create the possibility of winning the last part of the weather . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adult who now play adults is less emotional ro@@ oted and his par@@ ody is more in the casting of Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s years , like &quot; The hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand that cra@@ dle the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point , a character through a Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line skating , and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ emaker ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ icious Plot with Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Sho@@ emaker ) which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; as usual , the courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it makes a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ illons of Unter@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Singles &quot; , &quot; whose ex @-@ man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old kno@@ b . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments of random mad@@ ness that could heat this fran@@ chise as a sort of repeated &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is reminiscent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; at the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ to @-@ West Ring@@ battle @-@ I@@ con@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka are directed by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , a Romanian drama of eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who are fighting for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main tro@@ t - a hard @-@ lab@@ our@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i whose dialog@@ s of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are syn@@ ced to English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful tracks to view ( the police have the time to watch chess in television as Americans perhaps do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Op@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; . &quot;
but Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a killer who carries a Reagan mask is involved - that it is often like a single one .
&quot; with six long episodes it pul@@ ls itself , and com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; which was re@@ written to a smaller length could be better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American message , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour one bun@@ ch of Hamburg . &quot;
the embassy of the imag@@ ined communic@@ ative audience is that Western culture can do everything for the age of money .
the fic@@ tive Romanian creator had not been wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with them .
impact against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Konst@@ anz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , as the prosecutor &apos;s public prosecutor was ha@@ sted on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , 15 of the aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; moreover , officials presented large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; during the same raid in Italy , two persons were arrested . &quot;
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Italian .
the two will probably be shipped to Germany .
&quot; in the action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved . &quot;
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were used . &quot;
&quot; to the members of the Mafia , drug crimin@@ ality , serious violence , attempted murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and stress . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the public prosecutor &apos;s office is established in Constance at the south German public space . &quot;
between the sovereign bonds in Constance and Palermo a real exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; therefore , in Wednesday morning , the big race was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the research of the research , Italian nationals combined with regard to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on 27 May in hips , during the early morning several shots were fired in a restaurant , is likely to go to the bond &apos;s account . &quot;
way Major g@@ aps compl@@ ains in the fore@@ igner @-@ register
&quot; the data of citizens who should not emerge : according to a report , the fore@@ igner register has considerable lack in Germany . &quot;
this lead to partially serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
&quot; the mandate for refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has made a media report att@@ enti@@ vely to a media report . &quot;
defects in the there registered data could be identified at asylum procedures and deportation ; in part of a serious mis@@ decision , in a analysis called the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the register , there are ten million people with foreign nationality , among them about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data are therefore administ@@ rated by some 600 emigrated authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been well maintained , the data quality in parts have not been well maintained . &quot;
&quot; data from 1921 were found , &quot; by people who have long been alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; in@@ correct data set , recur@@ rent processes can significantly slow down , &quot; says the report on the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics of out @-@ out people , the EU citizens are caught , who would not have to travel out . &quot;
&quot; however , such false assign@@ ments led to &quot; a debate on dealing with trav@@ ellers &quot; that is therefore in analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government has made it possible to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy when they entered from there . &quot;
&quot; it emerg@@ es from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ back Newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to paper , the B@@ AM@@ F conduct such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since 1st June 2017 through . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Agreement is responsible for refugees of the EU state , which they reach first . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the country . &quot;
&quot; for the reason I write : &quot; &quot; meanwhile the recep@@ tivity has increased considerably for families with minor children in Italy . &quot;
Italy presented guarantees for the recording and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) hold this promise for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees to the Dublin agreement as part of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the inter@@ rog@@ ation of the Bundestag in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children above the lack of lack in Italian asylum system for lack of reception conditions and threat of child &apos;s health . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; a total of 220 litres of blood live in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , who already lived for other people in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at least of the twelve citizens , which were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , with his meanwhile 100 donations in the meantime , has meanwhile earned 50 litres of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the community lies in the meeting of the community , the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is in@@ gen@@ ious how our body is created for this , and we have the don@@ ate respect for foreigners who have their blood for foreigners , nor un@@ un@@ profitable , &quot; mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one single blood don@@ ors helps several people , &quot; explained the circular leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preser@@ ves are crushed into its components . &quot;
&quot; for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported of the actions that carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K Kreis@@ Leader . &quot;
apparently the change to the theatre house has led to higher participants only few years ago .
&quot; before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta Um@@ berto have been awarded to the majority of blood don@@ ate for each of 50 . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation caused the spec@@ ulation over an increase . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; mot@@ ions &quot; will remain , when they maintain interest rates on family income in the middle of a reinforced pressure . &quot;
&quot; the policy @-@ makers of the board ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 in order to maintain interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with this month fewer members agreed a rise , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its fourth annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household income would continue to rise to just under 3 % in autumn . &quot;
&quot; but they realized that in the next few years , interest rates would be necessary to breeding the inflation of Bre@@ xit , and they said that the loan costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
the members agreed to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut Business cycle that was published before a year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; it will be time for financial plan to provide funding from the coming February budget funding for banks , although it is expected that they will be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the scope of this system - with 115 billions of pound ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of M@@ PC gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as pressure on the real households of households continue to reduce consumption . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; is needed to cooling down inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; scale . &quot;
the markets currently anticip@@ ates the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the bank emphas@@ ized that increases &quot; gradu@@ ations &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; would be charged . &quot;
&quot; the Bank &apos;s revised growth forecasts for this and next year are projected to 1.9 % , and 1.7 % in May . &quot;
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to not change , after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have reduced the increasing expectations on an interest rate and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is likely to be at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly re@@ covering after the Bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the latest inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households who are affected by an increasing inflation and low @-@ time sal@@ aries , as the disappearance is first to be worse , before they become better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years could not be &quot; preventing &quot; , &quot; but they added that wages at the end of their three @-@ year forecast &quot; will be re@@ covering . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to weak pounds , which is compens@@ ated for a part of a lower consumer expenditure . &quot;
the decision comes from a year after lowering the interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ nel .
the Bank estimates that it will take four years until this will reach the prices and economy .
&quot; prior to the final verdict of the Bank on the interest rate , the reputation was increased after an interest rate , since inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households with three political decision @-@ makers in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % last month , although the Bank said that this was expected to recover and put it in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the surplus in relation to their goal of 2 % was &quot; entirely &quot; to gain the weak pounds .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ d , Director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; in view of the recent return of s@@ wap rates , mort@@ gage market should be more competitive again , as the borro@@ wers were looking for businesses looking for businesses and end the year in positive ways . &quot;
&quot; the market is especially good for those who run the existing De@@ als and close the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) to swal@@ low HIV dr@@ one 10.000 people
patients from September following a fight against the financing of the medication against the financing of the medication in N@@ HS have received access to a &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; HIV prevention .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one prior to sexual intercourse collected by around 86 percent , which can reduce the risk of infection at high risk analysis by about 86 percent , therefore , by the health service over a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he was willing to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal uph@@ eld a verdict of the Supreme Court of Justice during the previous year , confir@@ ming that the N@@ HS admitted to claim that the local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday announced a chess train was welcomed by N@@ HS England leader Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) , which was called &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first that will be able to enable the registration of people , and further clinics will be introduced in October 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ed phy@@ la@@ xe ( Pr@@ EP ) is a consequence of HIV @-@ preparation that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transmission in Inf@@ ection .
&quot; Pr@@ EP in front of intercourse means that , enough medicines in the body of a person is present to prevent an HIV infection . &quot;
such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who come for the treatment in question include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who were not successful . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified for appropriate participants who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner , whose HIV status is not known through anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy . &quot;
&quot; people living in England and registered with a home doctor , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic . &quot;
the programme will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs in this week after an international competitive pro@@ curement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by being collected in a large scale , as it is used in large scale . &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention was to complement and over@@ take the most successful efforts to prevention of HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in forests one of the greatest health challenges of humanity .
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ EP , when it is targeted for needy and dangerous people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with a high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed trial in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and is not being subject to a partner with a partner to improve many , many life . &quot;
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority now has to be accomplished that the study is rapidly carried out throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV . &quot;
&quot; now because the EP test medicine was purchased , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Sharon Hodg@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after months of delay and hes@@ itated by the government and over@@ due . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform these drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; now it is important that this study is done as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they contribute to that we will come closer to the termination of the prevalence of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 by a great house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and sold .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I spent in love and made a special offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a snow@@ y layout - it had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine add to the spacious ceiling height optim@@ ally .
&quot; I wanted to have high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi in Notting Hill to make the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to place one another , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which you could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to be creative to solve the submission .
&quot; the steel structure is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on each other , without having to g@@ aps . &quot;
&quot; it was not just a simple platform to build a simple platform , but to make the steel so that it had the right level up or down the right height . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down across the gl@@ am@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of sk@@ e@@ wers plays a role in adding theatres , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave him longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , refle@@ ctions feels like a window in another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units offer space for all the corner and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ ated MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is essential so that if you slide the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ diment@@ ary form , real estate agents will enter and carry out a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the floor space and to use high @-@ quality materials that make the room its luxurious benefit . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore helping to create an emotional binding in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not forget the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be changed through good design and increased square met@@ er@@ ations from something standard in something quite amazing .
&quot; indeed , like Jo@@ anne , could you decide to leave this . &quot;
brothers fighting for a 500 million US dollars of real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades , after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation because of one of the biggest real estate imperialist Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and its business capacity shall be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp argument on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 properties in the value of more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the family was bought in 1973 a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
there the West@@ co family founded Je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 to 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in Stadt@@ zen@@ rum , the development areas of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler , as well as shopping centers in the subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Colin - was described as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s wealth and Paul about one third . &quot;
&quot; according to a legal basis , this means that Colin property has a value of 316 million dollars and Paul in value of 176 million dollars . &quot;
the distribution of real estate and cash has proven itself for Paul as a pro@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; he left him of Colin proposed &apos; messages with him , which I held for the best objects , &quot; wrote in 2015 in a first affair . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several decades , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers also struggle to control over the existing business - including Colin , as Paul claimed to have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; Colin argu@@ ed that this was not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions . &quot;
&quot; in an early Mon@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to join the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held meetings . &quot;
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delic@@ acy transactions from the late 1950 &apos;s and in the early 1970s a business in Bruns@@ wick .
they used the safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Lie@@ gen@@ ius in which Colin opened the first Je@@ ans@@ wer@@ ot family .
Colin tells that he began to find West@@ co when he was in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoping to continue their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in front of court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke are not part of the De Lut@@ is Group group , with Colin claims that Mark is paid $ 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , so Paul says , &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin made herself back to Colin although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers contact .
&quot; only Colin answered with SMS to say &quot; I can really say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to compl@@ ain , and to take advantage of our family names by the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have wished that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he is still waiting for a solution . &quot;
this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Colin . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps of new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media coverage of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can do it actually .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , he introduced a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wants to repair : bad information that has come into the hands of the President . &quot;
&quot; Kelly said the staff that information should flow on him - whether on paper or writing - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have attempted to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship to TV lasts for decades - and now , where he is at the White House , its TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was off@@ ended because of a fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs , said the former campaign advis@@ ers Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February compared to POL@@ IT@@ ICO . &quot;
&quot; Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom to control , according to six former campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption contains a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom is ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridic@@ ulous .
perhaps this campaign officials have something we do not know that Tr@@ um@@ ps T@@ we@@ ets without their interventions could have even more spark material .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that has not sent Tr@@ ump .
&quot; when his employees create it already some times , trouble of him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but no one has been able to prevent tr@@ ump contro@@ versy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a white house composed of competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by promoting tr@@ ump material , possibly their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO - completely busy with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors , the president of strategic grounds , dou@@ bt@@ ful information . &quot;
this was an example written by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press lines , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he imag@@ ined how these come from . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened at the end of February , when someone gave to the President mal@@ ign@@ ant a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief but@@ cher of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks at the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson has been ban@@ ished for ch@@ ic@@ ans permanently from Twitter , or that he has no concrete evidence , or that he expressed false accus@@ ations in the past . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Staff of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his imp@@ ul@@ sive self , and his counsel@@ ors are still looking for influence . &quot;
this un@@ changing factors make the Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
master wanted crimin@@ als get postal mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the residents of the population will pray and er@@ hop@@ ed . &quot;
the police in all Europe shipped this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
&quot; as the addresses of the sought @-@ in @-@ war crimin@@ als are not known , critics are hop@@ ed out of the population and pray . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the promotion that follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Adv@@ ent calendar .
&quot; the experiences have shown that many vol@@ atile on holiday destinations , it was by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
&quot; for 21 postcards , I have compiled 21 postcards from 21 EU countries . &quot;
&quot; since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ asis , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online companions could have been arrested , at least eleven of them due to the publication on the website . &quot;
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est owner of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some unt@@ apped travelers on the war , which have negotiated one from the municipality drawn dit@@ ch to back a field before their men &apos;s houses . &quot;
travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ hull which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies , and an army of transporter , after being released first in May , without having been deported from a council of excav@@ ated dit@@ ch in order to prevent their sei@@ zu@@ res . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense plants and pressed their vehicles by a section that remained un@@ impe@@ ded to find a way .
&quot; angry inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said that it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; They are going to go there on Monday evening after they were sent away from Bentley Heath where they threw stones to the pass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced into action by shame , as he was us@@ eless in dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travelers were there in May , were moved and now back . &quot;
&quot; last night , more , probably more . &quot;
&quot; added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to surround us by taking long teaching instructions to protect their parks . &quot;
I live without at the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my common dest@@ iny if the Council could not stop it once .
&quot; a resident , who would not be called , said , &quot; It is ridic@@ ulous , we just have seen the last round of these travelers , only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and it even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; a spokesperson on Soli@@ hull , said : &quot; we are aware of the camp beyond the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we seize the necessary steps as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our reference collection , it is very important that as many citizens report a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police , by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine , when we place our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
&quot; from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise will be moved . &quot;
the house ahead of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with closure of the hotel Birken@@ hof by the then @-@ time ambient business company mbH to 13 April 2014 , there were some 30 000 nights per year , and also proceeds through the local tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of the figures of refugees who came to the County , the hotel building was offered as a colle@@ cti@@ bles for controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the order of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
&quot; at that time , the decision was not controversial at that time . &quot;
&quot; but above all Freu@@ den@@ nes &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the resort location and spoke already at the time of serious people interested in the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
the Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels group with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at an voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ chi@@ b .
&quot; you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof there have been a longer time building container before the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations work . &quot;
&quot; floors were pulled out , ceilings to part dismant@@ led , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
&quot; until March , there is still a lot to do . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the input area is re@@ designed , new windows are fitted . &quot;
everything should be &quot; nice &quot; close &quot; later by Thomas Sch@@ erer .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , spa area , and meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot;
&quot; not positioned at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bath , but already on a up@@ scale inner level , emphas@@ izes she@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms , wide up , explains sciss@@ ors further . &quot;
&quot; both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; interview with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , he has already led . &quot;
the performances of the city are identical with those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments asked , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly . &quot;
&quot; it calcul@@ ates just under a million euros , he calcul@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the outer plants are also brought to front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , a large terrace created by the restaurant , which is publicly accessible . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimi@@ stic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market .
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us special Jury sets a Grand Jury
&quot; in Russia &apos;s affair by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , he should have a special Jury named Robert Mu@@ eller following a report called Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; the body was recorded in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal to with the matter . &quot;
the newspaper revealed the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
&quot; CNN reported that the broad@@ caster CNN reported that , in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps , the oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
U.S. intelligence agencies acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin since long term to have entered into the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were abor@@ tions between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of investigations , several men are supposed to stand in the campaign as an advisor to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller took more and more pot@@ um@@ ps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special inter@@ medi@@ ary Tr@@ ump personally applied to the center and exam@@ ining whether the President may hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to prove and decide to decide whether charges should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also named count chambers .
&quot; in most cases , they are turned on when larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always closed behind closed doors .
&quot; moreover , the body can also be switched from the public prosecutor to pre @-@ charge people under oath . &quot;
&quot; according to the transmitter , CNN had already been issued to rotate the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who were involved in the meeting were to be called upon a statement , it was called in the report . &quot;
they should also provide documents .
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps Consult@@ ant and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ hner and his principal campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were on the conversation . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday night on Thursday evening , on Thursday night on Thursday night , the translation show that Mu@@ eller is not in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that it should be necessary quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it would not be promised that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the Gre@@ mi@@ um was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason to concern President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President took a speech in West Virginia to present Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the theme gives the Democrats an opportunity to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about that . &quot;
his special adviser to T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he does not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury .
&quot; but they usually work in obe@@ dience , he stressed . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures which accelerated the work of the special agent on &quot; f@@ aire &quot; way .
former FBI boss James Com@@ ey told three times that the president could not be determined against the President .
&quot; there is no reason to assume that something changed , it was called in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this R@@ aus@@ worm , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump were no@@ isy , he would like to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for a setting of investigations against the former national security advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under large pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; according to the representation of US media , the White House collected material against the special inter@@ medi@@ ator and his associates . &quot;
that triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller was released .
&quot; other than an independent Special Representative of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair by the later president Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller has fired a position in which he could be fired on the in@@ sist@@ ence of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of Republican and democratic sen@@ ators were indicted on Thursday , after which the special inter@@ medi@@ ator could no longer be released . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ice@@ berg is driving in the Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a gigantic ice@@ berg from the scar@@ cely seven @-@ fold magn@@ itude of Berlin has been solved . &quot;
he divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Maritime Research on Wednesday .
&quot; over a trillion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , large col@@ oring is now to the north and probably will probably need two , three years until it melted . &quot;
&quot; it is 175 kilometers length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice @-@ makers , who have registered researchers in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for man .
to what extent of climate change has played a role in the demol@@ ition of iron is un@@ clear .
&quot; in total , however , for about 30 years , there have been an unusual mer@@ ging of ice cream in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a factor background . &quot;
&quot; according to the opinion of many researchers , this could be combined with global warming . &quot;
the broken piston now has been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ dest .
carp@@ enter swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
&quot; consequently , it grows further into the sea and breaks regularly . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ dest is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula .
North of this circle the balance of wa@@ xes and break down was disturbed some years ago .
&quot; a complete sh@@ ouse was broken there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is some reason that Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ dest , too , is in danger because the front edge have never been withdrawn so far as currently . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the ice sla@@ b stand under tension and could disin@@ teg@@ rate in case of a key collection . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level not because they swim on the water , and ice as much water as it results in the melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the noise is that the gl@@ ac@@ iers can directly flow into the sea and much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; that could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a small size , writes the British research project to observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI , Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra is the fourth biggest sk@@ el@@ dest of the Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; the transition from the mainland is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 metres . &quot;
it breaks it regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural position and aware of us no direct connection to climate change , the ice plate now comes into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists be controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ dest return again or return in the long @-@ term , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers have not return the demol@@ ition of this gigantic ice@@ berg to change climate change , but in recent decades , many ice r@@ ations of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula are broken . &quot;
this long skir@@ t in Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the temperature increase was contributed to the drop .
&quot; in the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula war@@ med around three degrees and tell the areas where the temperature is fastest . &quot;
CDU wants to pay the pet in the staff
&quot; because it is increasingly difficult to occupy , free @-@ to @-@ end jobs , the CDU , from the employers association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer break , 41 new jobs in the administration has been carried out . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials are working for the county management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have their first working day . &quot;
the apprenti@@ ce at the circle are obviously very desired .
some 620 applicants were to be registered for this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle further lack personnel to manage the increased requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , there are 50 non @-@ occupied places at the district M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers are looking for the general administration . &quot;
the CDU wants to hold the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG to adopt the initiative and deplo@@ y the skilled workers in administration .
the administration is to work according to the desire of the parties &quot; a concept for recru@@ iting and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover only short @-@ term regret to skilled workers , but to counter@@ act future @-@ orient@@ ated candidate . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside , specific measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include action offensive , demand CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds already after a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems we didn &apos;t know earlier .
other cities advert@@ ise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is of a regular &quot; competition of public employer . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees comes from the service , or age @-@ related products . &quot;
&quot; thus , the highest time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; Klaus @-@ Dieter Daniels , president of the CDU , continues with his party even beyond its joint application . &quot;
&quot; he had already worked in a cra@@ y@@ day for a fat surprise , when he publicly posed the recruitment of personnel in question and bl@@ oss@@ oms the other parties . &quot;
&quot; people want to be checked , that all possibilities will be checked , which allow an exit from the communal employers association . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here , the county seat is to aim with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated cities - a family tariff , &quot; so peoples . &quot;
&quot; this makes the CDU , the employees and officials to pay better , when the tari@@ ffs will actually look for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are presently prescribed , enh@@ ancements , or more money , there is only if you change in a higher level that orient@@ ates itself to professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle grew steadily over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established , in which employees take care of the new pro@@ stitute law . &quot;
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers Land@@ lord Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy intensi@@ fies the tone to NGO &apos;s mig@@ rant rescue operations
&quot; in Italy , NGOs working for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they cannot continue to continue if they are not able to keep up new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs have no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Minister of Interior , Marco Min@@ n@@ iti said in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ n@@ itis was warning a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German aid organization &apos; Youth R@@ oot &apos; because their team worked effectively with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way , which lighten@@ ed illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to express themselves from the Italian state lawyer Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of the human life is our top priority . so we &apos;re sorry that we could not operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can judge all the accus@@ ations , which are currently collected , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth R@@ oot &apos; which has been supervised by I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October .
&quot; it is assumed that its crew @-@ boat migrants are transported on board , which can be delivered directly from the hands of traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting was supposedly found only 1,3 miles ahead of the Libyan coast , according to the ad@@ vers@@ ation of the state of State , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected to susp@@ end about the authority of Italian coast guards , the rescue @-@ entry in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not of any other moti@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats must have used boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , mainly an Italian police officers who monitored their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been explained to keep the code : Save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable since it would not be &quot; essential amendments or disabilities . &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize @-@ winning organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; Min@@ n@@ iti said meanwhile that the number of migrants arrested in Italy in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guards and co @-@ operation with the local civil war . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizenship in this month &apos;s economic development initiative , and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
climb and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the northern p@@ fal@@ z to enjoy four days long and enjoy the sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley turned out as a good starting point for tours .
Burg@@ - and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome bonus .
the first tour took hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; apart from observation points , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the fal@@ se@@ wer forest and the down@@ stream levels . &quot;
there was again a longer climb for the long Tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Pop@@ ular Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again , look@@ out point moves to look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate increase . &quot;
on the last two days there were many al@@ tim@@ eter again .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and resi@@ du@@ es brought to welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers ate in the open @-@ air content of healing Sole .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters , the group had learned the P@@ fäl@@ zer@@ zer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundesliga is preparing for e @-@ sport
&quot; the sport stars will sit in front of computer consol@@ es in the future , instead of fighting wind and weather in the stadium to fight ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport is a long @-@ growing industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; this also recognised the first federal lig@@ aver@@ an , which increasingly engage in this area . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of 2015 V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire a new young target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says President Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
he is certain that there are still some clubs on this train .
&quot; at the coming weekend , FIFA World Cup organised the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; at which the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven have qualified for example . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now has a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; in particular , the real soccer team has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that the young people still go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , you could be present much more often on these markets than just once a year . &quot;
what is it right ?
&quot; during the e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or even the FIFA World Cup FIFA on competition . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sport , they have become established , in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asia &apos;s 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it all about a proper sport@@ scar ?
&quot; for many , the performance is certainly acc@@ ust@@ omed . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bers has long been dealt with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German sports school in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions show that one can also find cardi@@ ac frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response capacity . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise at the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition . &quot;
the first player is a good player .
&quot; however , F@@ rob@@ bers also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is always more a topic . &quot;
&quot; controls were hard @-@ managed at online games , and in the scene missing the structures of classic sport . &quot;
&quot; positively , scientists emphas@@ izes the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports . &quot;
&quot; players are internationally on the way , that is like a large global family , there are no inter@@ cultural shirts . &quot;
a study by the company consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts the e @-@ sport a rapid growth .
&quot; in 2016 , over 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , revenue should be at 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; no longer be removed from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; writing the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
there are many countries worldwide .
large markets are Asia and the US where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ sports competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there are also something in Europe .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as Ped@@ agog@@ ical , says F@@ rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ first League clubs are currently obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison to Germany , V@@ f@@ B &apos;s executive board explains R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; just nostal@@ gia to fall in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is not enough anymore . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter , because of the texts that Conrad Roy &apos;s suicide , condemned &quot;
&quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to suicide . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were suspended on par@@ ole . &quot;
Carter was condemned in June due to a negli@@ g@@ ent murder of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until appeal .
&quot; she was confron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy has led to a psychological illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ use , Carter stood with tears in his eyes , folded hands and facing down eyes when they were condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have been murdered by Conrad Roy , &quot; said the State lawyer . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility for responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said that it was a &quot; awesome circum@@ stance that she was completely regre@@ t@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that their &quot; age or riding bike or even their spirits have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a At@@ tor@@ ney read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is no day in which I was not the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want it to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will bear with us for ever to be there for his sisters , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys Sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would be followed by the realization that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or to be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer have the only person , with whom I was together for my birth every day , is a pain that I will always keep my life with me , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legally preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to challenge another , commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mono@@ xide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to finish his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging on , spring from a building , inv@@ ent yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent to his death in the two weeks before his family . &quot;
&quot; before his suicide she wrote , &quot; You must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Everything that you need to do is to switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter searched attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; to the few who defended Carter , belonged to Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 due to murder of her British co @-@ residence in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; woman Knox , 30 years old , published in Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learn from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua K@@ imm@@ i was allowed to run up to the Audi Cup as captain , is no coincidence . &quot;
the FC Bayern mar@@ ries the World @-@ Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; something was different on his place in the cabin , that was Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the extra garment piece was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , there is no Philipp Lah@@ m and also not a Manuel New York , he made a bind to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach did not have announced , &quot; the last Cup winner told the winner , after its first use as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot;
good but it could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could also interpre@@ t .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was born in the youth players , Deb@@ üt@@ ants and just out of the vacation that have chosen professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game guide , but he was chosen . &quot;
&quot; pure sugar is distributed to those who want to find a lot , which one wants to keep in mood . &quot;
&quot; so , whoever has chosen out to compete in Lah@@ m , can only use a little extra @-@ motivation for little motivation . &quot;
&quot; K@@ imm@@ ich , confirmed : &quot; that is what you want to be as a player : responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old became a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field . &quot;
&quot; right behind , this is his position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , K@@ imm@@ i worked in this starting information such as the one who can also take the ru@@ dder right in the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , attempted to direct the in@@ jected trou@@ pe . &quot;
&quot; he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy themselves . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Vi@@ dal makes his missing fitness to over@@ play ( fol@@ te hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches come to the Devil &apos;s services , and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le make it not to fall short in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
it all worked well .
&quot; in addition to K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y ran in front of the def@@ endants , both ag@@ ated confident . &quot;
&quot; the famous Nap@@ oli storm did so difficult , in addition , Sü@@ ver tried to have a few times in the game . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y said that the result was not so , as we have hop@@ ed ourselves . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance in the debut .
&quot; playing dates , speed change : &quot; for this style I was fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as usual , this Bayern world is still looking for the new length of reference to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Rud@@ y had not one or two interviews in the Cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
K@@ imm@@ ich passed after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements on his new player &apos;s back .
&quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le a interesting set : &quot; what &apos;s going on , I already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you must simply win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the New . &quot;

company satisfied with Rheinland @-@ p@@ fal@@ sely minister : Economics pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings pace
&quot; often , often un@@ reconc@@ iled , the relationship between the country and regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still the Minister of Economy of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
this shows itself after more than one year in which the new economic minister Volker Wiss@@ ing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ inquiry about a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old ministry .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) says : &quot; knowledge attacks the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all has blocked . &quot;
the biggest flip @-@ turn sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the connection of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now in the priority list of the country now .
&quot; in this year , the ministry is hop@@ ed for planning procedures , until 2021 the construction is supposed to stand . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ ung Trier , which is in the fore@@ ver@@ able demand of the Federal Rail@@ road map . &quot;
&quot; it is the aim to take the route in December 2020 , the Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann says . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but international competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) has taken over , such as knowledge , in the wine a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to boost sales in supermarkets and for the trend of the German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , knowing an open ear for people who want to establish a own company pra@@ ises the I@@ HK . &quot;
&quot; in the new master bonus , the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees an additional inc@@ entive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a bonus of 1000 Euro is provided for the award @-@ winning master examination and 2,500 euros , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; as planned as planned road@@ works , we can easily create facts at the same time , as Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief leader of the I@@ HK Trier . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , who wants to set up operations to mobility , have only 29 positions so far . &quot;
the I@@ HK calls for more orders to external offices .
&quot; the CDU faction vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to the calculations of the bill , investing in the country in 2017 and 2018 , more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of country roads . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank Nat@@ us also expects to fix the country &apos;s concept as it wants to fix it in the region . &quot;
further wide full range of broadband in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had assessed the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the score 3.4 . &quot;
they compl@@ ain about mol@@ dy Internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
former Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of wind power company Pro Wind .

&quot; Audi is supposed to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers are confron@@ ted with a counter@@ action . &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW @-@ President said that the company is the opinion that &quot; it is more intelligent options than travel constra@@ ints , &quot; and thus referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to provide or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Daimler announced that there will be three million vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the company described the companies as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance requirements for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ its the diesel engines , are considered to cause carcin@@ ogenic and may cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of vehicle manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles to install exhaust gases also take too , which makes it difficult to hold the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also tried to ignore the powerful car companies and to ignore the signs of the problem .
&quot; the company try to avoid the faul@@ ts of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called sy@@ alt appliances that have been tested in order to comply with the regulations , but by normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were accused of Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former leader of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be placed in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen after the authorities have installed a system to avoid the emission requirements in Europe , and a request that was concentrated on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the study could be heavy for Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer makes over @-@ proportional to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ ards and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; in time , Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most widely published carto@@ on character , the cre@@ oll@@ ards of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ inian player is still working and working on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he was assassin@@ ated as a character for bl@@ aming tickets - what fru@@ str@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ iest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the 1960s , New York and Paris succeeded him out during the end of the 1960s , with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
&quot; again , the artist of towns inspired him to be inspired . &quot;
&quot; large , rounded mor@@ di@@ llo @-@ figures were moved into drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; according to the early morning , he is still sitting at the cartoon animation , almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; on calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches find its dro@@ p@@ tuous characters continue to spread much spread throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has also been working on a drawing film and a TV series with its figures . &quot;
the main character in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s favourite animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as counter@@ player .
&quot; for the first time , his figures in the 3D @-@ film which will come to the Kin@@ ol@@ ein@@ wall in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they will say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore he rather sets up the TV series , which is how its original drawings , what is produced . &quot;
lavender from Provence from Climate Change
&quot; he became a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; lavender is due to the conditions of d@@ rought remin@@ ders and due to the diseases transmitted to insects , scientists and farmers who try to find solutions to find great heada@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ vez , an expert of the farm research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant had brought the effects of climate change in the spring of much less rain and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has impact on the life of lavender .
&quot; there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium which bears the d@@ warf , and very dry weather there is much of it . &quot;
and it &apos;s a lot on the game .
&quot; lavender oil is not only sho@@ cked for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very asked for perfume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ vez said : &quot; instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; solutions that are considered to be considered , are a better water distribution and slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry resistant . &quot;

the Ass@@ assin@@ ation of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ ce &apos;s staff will normally meet on Wed@@ nes@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the youngest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a , organised by organised crime , corrupt civil servants and civil wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
&quot; it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , which were the aim of an attack with gren@@ ades , or leave it home in 2009 . &quot;
&quot; security experts have three words on a table in the front of the room : opponent , Neut@@ ral , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the rep@@ orters , names for each column - no proof is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdominal cav@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; there are drug decor@@ ating , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , who are suspected of standing at the beh@@ est list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als making the chaos of Mexico . &quot;
&quot; there are no rest of violence , and while throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent , more journalists are at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto had his office in December 2012 , and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is deeply impressed , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which depic@@ ts his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; . two reporter in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez , carry T @-@ Shirts , which show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will take place in less than two months after his death , and the reporter discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , insom@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although the Prosecutor &apos;s Office was erected in 2010 to work the cases of journalists , these according to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of murders , each year with drug retailers and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely presented in court . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ ce , they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , even though they are in@@ tr@@ ater@@ ally east and even though the terrain is still more angry . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without righteousness , the meeting at the discussion of safety , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid , my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we susp@@ ect all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of Ri@@ o@@ ce &apos;s office in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . he was shot from his car and was shot at him for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot; &quot;
the shooter drove off in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on Val@@ dez &apos;s theme there is practically no silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans had been arrested last year and the extradition of the United States in January was to fight for one of the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; there is nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ story maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug @-@ controlled who are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; for a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) is a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first in February , the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , they probably bought each copy of the output , as soon as she was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second bug was to force Val@@ dez , after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country on its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues did that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he was together with five colleagues for the creation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism , without encounter the g@@ low poison problem , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot;
&quot; at the time , the newspaper earned a call for the cour@@ ageous and honest coverage , and the turnover and advertising took place . &quot;
&quot; rep@@ orters loved it to publish hard @-@ end investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else had to deal with . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursu@@ it of Mexican drug history , where she also led them . &quot;
he gave up voluntarily to be afraid .
&quot; I would like to live on , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug dealers in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; said he in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October . &quot;
you must take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do with so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ak @-@ bird , who was like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was gener@@ ously with h@@ ugs and Coun@@ ts , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he always would go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , walking and sitting there on the same table . &quot;
&quot; now she asks , Is his love to be a routine ? &quot;
&quot; his death also has forced them to ask her own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can do their work best , and they can stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you are dealing with their women , their children , their clean stores , their home starting and landing ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ risk and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ able .
&quot; if it doesn &apos;t smell , stay away . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then it happened with Javier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , such as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ust sm@@ ug@@ gle , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed . days before it was announced that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
two polic@@ emen seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle class of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the scher@@ z , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers are among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who are governor themselves as not tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the rep@@ orters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug parties de facto are under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ ce has cli@@ cked on three main stories . &quot;
it was the assassination of the brother Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state expenditure , concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the governor . &quot;
&quot; there was a group that took place in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor &apos;s Office . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who has been kidnapped , or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician , who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled nearly all political levels . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orters to write about previous incid@@ ents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , readers would have liked the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; previously we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim body muscles . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office has been dedicated to the storage room for signs and st@@ icker , dedicated to the murders of journalists , because the employees have become something they would never have expected , activists in the name of the press . &quot;
reporter Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez s@@ nat@@ ched a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalist at the office of the Prosecutor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the Western State of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and civil servants , based on DNA tests that it is his . &quot;
&quot; throughout the country , journalists were stronger than they were written in organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; for walking and construction . &quot;
this day is the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to deliver journalists and kill it because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then she has asked for ever since she is worried about the government , because she is concerned that their rage has hurt their objec@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organizing crimes , involved in government officials and an equal society . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his final book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters won &apos;t only be killed by drug traff@@ icking , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces , linked to organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you die because they want that you hold the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the kill@@ ings have a terrible effect .
nobody for@@ getting the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern boundary state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phone were standing apart from their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of correspon@@ dents MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to make El man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly set up the drug ticket with an editorial in the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are escaped from their home state or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is difficult to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and seek to dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are ch@@ ased , as it is evi@@ den@@ ced by the photographer Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who continue back and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , announces that the drug retailers are troubled . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell and therefore I became reporter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight last Friday , when the last edition was finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ ce sitting on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer when all their teleph@@ ones began to sum@@ ming up all their phones . &quot;
a series of shooting stars with rib@@ bed belts and security forces close to the beach of Maz@@ at@@ lan 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued on how it was promised by a series of Kart@@ ell em@@ bassies in the region .
from on @-@ board can@@ oes they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ ce on mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ els close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers to see if they were in read@@ iness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they didn &apos;t show it . &quot;
&quot; under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ ce followed its tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; if the same day , at the same day , the practition@@ ers asked me to send them to the reporting on the street . &quot;
&quot; Dinosau@@ rs , used to so@@ ften his enemies . &quot;
&quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue , even if a sc@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; now , researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable rhin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so good to get that it was even noticeable that his fl@@ ak@@ y skin was of rough brown - and they said , she would have had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; called it as &quot; the &quot; held din@@ osau@@ rs , who ever was found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens in the world . &quot;
&quot; fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his incredibly well preserved condition , researchers that character@@ ize it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mo@@ red plant e@@ aters is the best preserved b@@ ays of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Shawn Radio when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada , at 21 March 2011 . &quot;
&quot; he met on something similar to the surrounding rock out of the square , and decided to look closer . &quot;
he discovered the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; after all these hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you have blin@@ king only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is visible . &quot;
&quot; it is used in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens , mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers found that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a wall tank , probably threatened by flesh @-@ vo@@ res din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly formed din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves from pre@@ dat@@ or , and used a par@@ ach@@ uting technique that is used as counter@@ attack , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have been allowed to mix well in its surroundings and to so@@ ften its enemies , experts say what it indicates that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , made head@@ lines for the first time in May , is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours in order to discover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing conservation of specimen enabled it by Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ aments about his body . &quot;
&quot; she discovered the counter@@ sha@@ ding , a widespread defense method in the animal realm , meaning that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the condition is custom@@ ary , the results are surprising because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds by far the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased enough pressure by the e@@ aters of Dinosau@@ rs , that evolution represents the wear of con@@ frontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals , which use the counter @-@ sha@@ ding - do you think of Re@@ he , Zeb@@ ras or Gir@@ d - are much smaller and harm than prey that signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real battle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strongly harvested din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous to have been the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ory of the chal@@ k time , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their sc@@ als also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r rot@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on hin@@ ts about his life , including his brain Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs died when he died , into a river , and cast into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alberta was so warm as south fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland as they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ ser@@ ed skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of animal ret@@ ains , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal today looks almost as in the early chal@@ k time .
&quot; you do not need a lot of imagination to re@@ design it . if you are just a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when huge Ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous Dinosau@@ rs , that stood on two legs , crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the King of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus Rex , millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of its fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tonnes he@@ avi@@ est monster . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta has sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ ified in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Shawn Radio when he died on March 21 , 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the retained din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were aver@@ aged around 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ik@@ es taken by his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant @-@ e@@ aters was pushed through the western Canada , until an flooded river was flooded into the open sea . &quot;
&quot; but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite item detail . &quot;
&quot; the rem@@ nants of this special specimen , so well preserved , that the skin care still cover hol@@ low tank plates along the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; like Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko for National Ge@@ ographic , it is such a level of conservation so &apos; rarely as a profit in Lotto . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it . &quot;
&quot; hidden rem@@ nants of the skin still cover the hol@@ low tank panels , which carry the skull of the beast . &quot;
&quot; his right front foot lies on his side , his five fingers crossed up . &quot;
I can count the she@@ ds at his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : many injured
on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , miles long run@@ off - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the late Thursday afternoon of the Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , approximately 20 people were injured in the late Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the first details of the police , at 5@@ pm there were between the hang@@ ar Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( County Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm under 30 vehicles , including trucks and trucks . &quot;
&quot; on the exact number of injured persons , no data were first published . &quot;
&quot; it came to light to moderate injuries , said a pol@@ ze@@ al pre@@ cher . &quot;
a big boost to rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
&quot; in Fahr@@ enheit Munich , a approximately ten @-@ kilometer long retreat was formed . &quot;
&quot; like an AZ reporter , there was also on the opposite way to massive disability - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ched the signs of the vehicle hand@@ leb@@ ars which now have to calculate with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , another accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between a car carrier and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is being sitting on the train and sleeps .
or you are deeper into his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and w@@ akes an un@@ cle@@ ft or ri@@ ps the g@@ ast in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of breaks are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the smart ticket inspection .
&quot; it is simply confirmed by mobile phone , that one should be taken at his place , and makes the ticket . &quot;
&quot; at present , a test run is running on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer comes , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available to many other routes in Germany at the beginning of this year , &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the railway line de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner .
&quot; to use the advantage , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to booked an online ticket - what &apos;s going to do most passengers already .
&quot; it also has to be purchased over the app by rail , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket bu@@ ckets . &quot;
and finally you need a seat space .
because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works as follows : one increases in the train calling his ticket under &quot; My tickets . &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , then a button to the electronic de@@ valuation . &quot;
the train managers get on their mobile devices a message that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X has taken on the train and taken the booked seat platz Y .
&quot; comes the train conductor at No. Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already an online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue reading , continue working , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the rail , which is to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel without a ticket check through our train personnel , check the DB Navigator itself . &quot;
&quot; this enables the passengers to design their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management of DB Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations . &quot;
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to meet the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often goes train , knows that in addition to delay and missed trains the road@@ map controls belong to the greatest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for often , one of the travelers do not need any documents in any case , which one needs to be used for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document must be given .
&quot; the consequence are endless discussions between train managers and Fahr@@ g@@ ast , which leads to bad mood in the ab@@ out@@ or and del@@ ays during the control of your own tickets , taking the Schaff@@ ner at the end time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is also only on connections with ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional train numbers on the same circuit are not un@@ locked .
&quot; as a activist , she came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , it sat in St. Louis Geb@@ r on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and sc@@ roll@@ ers through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
they stum@@ bled upon a mail from somebody from the High School .
&quot; the police just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; it was there . &quot;
&quot; confused when nobody had posted the information on their feed , she finished Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly praying on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was there , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Bro@@ wns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body that was stretched out on the street and stay there four hours there .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; Fer@@ rell thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
&quot; on the evening , she turned their mobile phone to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive . &quot;
&quot; there were photos of police officers and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; they observed a live feed , where a polic@@ eman appeared before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a rebellious dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , secured a different polic@@ eman and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill you . &quot;
&quot; that is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell remin@@ ded of her statement . &quot;
&quot; this is not the kind of murder , which we have used to ourselves and we can call it typical . &quot;
at this moment I felt sho@@ ots .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
&quot; she booked a return flight , and went home the next day . &quot;
&quot; after landing at 23 : 00 , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two next morning to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the point of view , living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two have a conversation which they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember , as I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; do they remember what she said . &quot;
&quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed 18 year @-@ old boys and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take it , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
&quot; it must know , and it will see and be tu@@ cked up . &quot;
&quot; it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vism and organisation , but also know the different layers of black experience and black Constitution and what we need to do to free to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she is not a ek@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I feel the feeling , I would give it a bad service to keep them off . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police office , which was at a camp area , when the activists had waited for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter connected with a local business partner , had lunch . &quot;
&quot; they prepared bags , and helped to pass on demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
slowly began a new type of acti@@ vism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s form .
&quot; my acti@@ vism changed after the 9th of August , she said and not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ ur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food justice and health qualities in black municipalities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
everything has come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an told her , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; will you document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; these scep@@ tic@@ ism has been nourished by countless cases of people , often from white - in a community that benef@@ ited from pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who have been born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised up their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for its acti@@ vism on death prisoners . &quot;
&quot; the project was getting closer together , together with six other loc@@ als followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Bro@@ wns . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we speak , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the aim was to concentrate on Fer@@ rell@@ s &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah , but for a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participation in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprising personal aspects of Fer@@ tility &apos;s life as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I understood that in this work , and in the realisation of black people there must be a certain level of injuries . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rell@@ s has repeated the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the Movement , which after killing the black te@@ ager tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identi@@ fies as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in executive positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and so we are constantly fighting with different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must carry the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that , &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an em@@ ative type of action &quot; in which Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coincidence , even though it was on the front line , because with a life on these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can sense its energy through the screen .
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long disappeared , but the racial connections between the congregation and the police continue . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless she kl@@ amm@@ ates in a song and she feels obliged to this memory , since she went on the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; Or@@ w@@ ahn &quot; : TV readers discuss with bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not yet built . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre at the end of the pedestrian zone has been out@@ dated since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
&quot; cold , the topic can hardly have one . &quot;
the theme is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; on our Facebook page .
&quot; as one of the bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; it doesn &apos;t need a person &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ nets ) or simply : &quot; &quot; w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery draws more customers into the city , of which also the other shops benefit , fear the ad@@ versaries that then ha@@ em@@ or@@ ates the pedestrian zone . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned exactly on the premises , on which the farm@@ stead stands , in which 13 direct mark@@ eters can offer its products . &quot;
the construction work is concluded with the beginning of the construction work .
&quot; the gallery M@@ acher wants to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with possibility to sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; Simone Room : &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost weekly in the farm@@ stead for many years . &quot;
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land women are very happy again . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s but@@ cher .
we would like to wish that during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , there is also this . &quot;
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting .
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct mark@@ eters in a market hall in the gallery comes to the amount of rent .
&quot; the new project , however , should not be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the most shopping mall in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothing , shoes , dro@@ oping - or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are enough enough of it in our city .
you see how many cargo shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but here , however , there is not even a regular weekly market , it is the more important that we will stay at least the Mark@@ thalle . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered are fresh , is generally offered directly from the producer and is ob@@ end@@ ably priced . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shop transactions are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies , because the dor@@ m Mi@@ etes are often not contra@@ ctual for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special stores are almost no longer and what is left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where should the farm market stands during the construction period ?
old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the bit gallery occurs at some point .
or does the g@@ hosts bit gallery already distribute all the shops of Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will not work .
&quot; and there is no one shopping center , which is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; after my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farm market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
but there &apos;s no place for a farm market in Bit@@ burg thanks to the wa@@ hn@@ y of many - how I find a good construction projects in Bit@@ burg .

&quot; in the middle of the fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which depend on the ceiling of the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the 30 portraits were sent by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ lift and hair@@ cut , which you were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ tics sent a 35 @-@ year prison term after she publicly made diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks site . &quot;
a new exhibition opened on 2 August is A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A fitting simil@@ arity ) .
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was united in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ gression , and pioneering dis@@ sid@@ y , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg created the DNA analysis of the DNA that has been extracted from Mann@@ ing , and created out of the 30 portraits , like someone with this gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like a sharp comment , as well as something intellectual comments can be created , and inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of this inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to the identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Bradley Edward , has been openly spoken of the identification as a woman , was convicted in 2013 for 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the sp@@ ying law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison , her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only a single photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ in@@ blonde per@@ verse - with whom it was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
&quot; in it , the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ ish arti@@ facts like cig@@ ars and che@@ wing gum produced by producing the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what these people might look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were added to un@@ equal letters that ex@@ changes several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated comic strip &quot; Supp@@ orted images , &quot; which would be able to convert a future in which the President of the Chel@@ em judgement would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ers release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome way of happy gathering . &quot;
&quot; there are also now at the opening of the exhibition a little bass and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the warehouse and against Trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ ely ways to fix the rigid divisions that he should resolve further . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the wei@@ rd timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things are going to happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the Galerie &apos;s artistic testimony called Mann@@ ing with her superior signature , including the &quot; i &quot; in their family name is an end of the &quot; automatic disin@@ teg@@ ration , whose foundation gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , their mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence is written - a thou@@ sand@@ ing of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological respects . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take away , is that our gen@@ ome is not concerned about who we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so that &apos;s 30 of these stories . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in an own room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic Nov@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; it shows Mann@@ ing , as it emerg@@ es with a hands @-@ free float in the hand of the United States like King @-@ Hong Kong . &quot;
&quot; when they ch@@ ill your speech in cold , then they have won . &quot;
&quot; so never forget the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came straight from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; the artist said from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get ge@@ ese , when I speak about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was fore@@ seen in the comic book - but if they should do it , then it will be greeted by their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ls that are summar@@ ized as hor@@ des of protest@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) in which their genetic h@@ ap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was behind her liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee at the University of Oxford for murder
&quot; a nationwide human hunt is underway to a professor at North@@ western University and an employee at the University of Oxford , which had been sought after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Cook County Court . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a common warning system published by the Police Department of Chicago said that Lei@@ che was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victims of several injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the site of the event for dead , and det@@ ective investigation as murder , while the police actively searches after the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
L@@ ath@@ em has been an extraordinary Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University in 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cuban , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em was now in be@@ ur@@ lau@@ ts and excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter which is examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates at this examination , &quot; said Cub@@ es . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail statement , a speaker at the University and the Somer@@ ville College said that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the US investig@@ ational authorities on any possible way . &quot;
&quot; the statement , added that War@@ r@@ ens were sho@@ cked and want to be sho@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he needs the susp@@ ects to establish itself the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of her residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , rein@@ force , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , said that in apartment 10@@ 08 had happened . &quot;
the police described the scene as much cru@@ el@@ ly .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the axis and the background of the victim , and explo@@ res a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future , &quot; the Russian vice @-@ president Mut@@ ko &quot;
the Russian vice @-@ president Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said that it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ fill@@ ment of the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA tim@@ etable was updated in this regard , &quot; Mut@@ ko declared on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA schedule to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for recovery of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything what to concern Russia &apos;s occasion . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WA@@ DA in near future .
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities approved the reported findings of by the WA@@ DA approved by the Canadian attor@@ ney Richard McLaren to alleged government sponsored D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we conduct the analysis because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we won &apos;t admit something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ k@@ os Wor@@ ds agree with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales site R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v announced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the D@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from the D@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als in Russia in November 2015 .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Olivier Niger gl@@ i declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved to &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di has only sold no eggs more
this shared the corporate groups .
&quot; there is a mere precau@@ tionary measure , it could continue to be assumed for no health conditions , it was accepted in the release . &quot;
&quot; from now , only eggs should be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to be tested negative on fi@@ xation @-@ like anti @-@ les@@ ions . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency at its customers .
&quot; start @-@ ups that will help your company , not to be next U@@ ber &quot;
Amy salvation wanted to compete in your employee at your e @-@ commerce start@@ up but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
answers were often v@@ ague and little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
&quot; and even if you spoke to An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; says salvation that operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed . &quot;
she called people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies find out how to feel their staff .
&quot; thanks to the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment , it enables companies to deal with surveys , special groups and demo@@ graphic groups to deal with the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used to measure employee commitment . &quot;
&quot; she said that she has a better insight into what your staff think and feel right in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company that show at a glance , which units have the most complaints and which managers have low conditions results - so that you can re@@ boot why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since then an ex @-@ employee describes a blog post , with those who have spoken , punished . &quot;
for start@@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t is this desire for an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry might have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value by 2020 according to the financial technical website let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up convertible , the company helps prevent bad behavior and to recognize , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ t Conver@@ t Conver@@ ts Custom@@ ized &quot; Pul@@ p &quot; P@@ olls , collect confi@@ dential answers in real @-@ time and watch the heat @-@ cards of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which can notify members of bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; and if the main leader is involved , complaints will go directly to the supervisory board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that his employees are badly treated or in@@ ethical , it can experience valuable consequences by consumer @-@ boy@@ cott , employee fluid and complaints , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Conver@@ cent has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple way to achieve its headquarters . &quot;
&quot; previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel said that there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now since the company Conver@@ cent enters , problems that were previously identified by executives that were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment , or ins@@ ens@@ ly practices . &quot;
&quot; I can closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree point of view into the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano that leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders before employment , lit@@ igation . &quot;
&quot; company started to take ethics , values , and employee commitment in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collapsed because of ethical violations by Enron sc@@ andal , Quin@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; Social Media &quot; came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that their dirty clothes went online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitoring ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as service , and ins@@ ets the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products . &quot;
it is a business model and a chance to adopt the approval of venture capital investors who supports both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Conver@@ t received $ 10 million for funding in February of firms such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which has raised the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer venture Partners and brought its entire funding to $ 60 million .
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , indicating that today &apos;s employees expect more than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only assign@@ ments . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that their voices are heard , and that the work that you do is worth it , then feel stronger to this company , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience for Link@@ ed@@ In which includes both Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ ites if their portfolio company are well @-@ running . companies are running well when employees are engaged and engaged .
&quot; if the analy@@ tics tools promise third parties , commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you can find support . &quot;
&quot; according to experts of the workplace culture , the data is important . &quot;
but the data are us@@ eless when the administrator of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company wonders according to your feedback , it may have expect@@ ation that change on the way is . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come quickly , or not at all , this dis@@ appointments and employees can motiv@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be willing to have 4.000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company that has left too much to collecting data . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t follow employees , don &apos;t you really hear me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
and who don &apos;t care about why should I ?
&quot; Madison Reed , who is now going through monthly employee surveys , was able to lead action on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t so salvation . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organise the decision of decision @-@ making and quality of communication , to organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; in Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights via the staff , and it hopes for a long run , which leads to a better ties of workers in a sector that is known for high sales . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose human beings , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you will lose customers . &quot;
and if you lose customers then you will lose company .
the N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day intern@@ ship and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it is on 23 o &apos;clock to enter@@ tain a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have moved out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of silence of the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team they represent a lunch break .
&quot; players who are enrolled in the summer courses are going to return to their final tests , before returning next morning at 6 : 30 a.m. to the Wasser@@ weg Football Center . &quot;
&quot; that is for the guys the next three days a real T@@ ret@@ mill , &quot; &quot; Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a said before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and she has actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training of U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 , to be able to meet the players already fully underway . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than one day , in which the Bru@@ ins moved almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing time in West@@ wood offers practical exercises . &quot;
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises in the course of August . 20 before the start of the formal preparations for their start against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he will support the regul@@ ative change of the N@@ CAA , even if they add another point of busy routes . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it out , they are looking forward , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think soon as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished , in view of the clear gui@@ deline of its fields from an adjacent parking place and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel which has already been thrown by foot balls , which has already been a protective system behind a tor@@ pe@@ fo@@ es , which will be no easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players will occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched that people rent there a room and then set up there to record a practice . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of one exercise , it &apos;s a quite good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t make too much worry about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to change facts review in the fight against counter@@ feit messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more pot@@ ent articles with counter@@ feit messages from third parties and their results under the original contribution , then the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods , to recognize possible fal@@ se@@ messages , and may indicate the results of the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main participation points for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , of which many believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem is also become a great political topic in Europe , where French voters were flooded in the run of the presidential election in May with wrong stories , and Germany will not succeed to eliminate h@@ ass@@ filled Post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement on German that the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany started a test of the new facts review . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge , which stories of fac@@ tions pro@@ ving third parties want people to make more context to make well @-@ founded decisions on what they read and share , &quot; &quot; Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to test his feature in the &quot; &quot; linked articles &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to his news feed to decrease false news . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was an end for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ 1980 and 1980 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history in the Be@@ wl River valley in K@@ ent and is now available for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mop@@ ar Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ bed@@ time . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; stretches the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who were living in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes that was based on a archive : it wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expect@@ edly emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acts on the Dau@@ gh@@ ter print on the side of a letter , which was written by a double player in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; that is his Dau@@ gh@@ ter print !
&quot; and letters always smell of smoke , because then a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect as if he himself would be there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who sm@@ itten so with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived nearly four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated &quot; ) this all seems too beautiful to be true .
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ arch@@ ed heads of walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape @-@ care , gar@@ dener and sometimes with the artists , who worked at the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key &quot; and began writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was only received the full access in 2006 when the last time I am , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ oc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , maps which represent what possessed : &quot; one could mean that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have been fighting for two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let it go all its way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to leave a bre@@ eder basis in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peas@@ ant stand of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book titled &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the peas@@ ant stood in this area and I thought , an uprising was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are associated with each other ? &quot;
other stories are ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ers that hid the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English re@@ formation .
&quot; or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell staged in the 18th century , filled his own funeral , filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was first dug later than his sar@@ g ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rell@@ s are Rhodes &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be a g@@ aun@@ er to make debt and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men del@@ etes their debt crisis by giving rich old women , I imagine it as a he@@ ap well @-@ looking guys before , with a talent to advert@@ ise land@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his approach in the castle , Rhodes is searching for other unique write @-@ experiences &quot;
&quot; he brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ sto@@ än@@ mä@@ ki behind him , the site of a san@@ atorium dating back to the early 20th century , which has since been brought back from nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;

campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ chapel covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 Years old Mari@@ en@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team plans to keep the logo and the slogan . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , it should be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; the makers of action have been on posters on the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) do not really , write it on her yesterday un@@ locked website . &quot;
but we use this measure to win your attention .
&quot; and to make clear that it is better , than it seems . &quot;
&quot; basically , we are the solid conviction that we know as a bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer to know the beauty and attra@@ cti@@ veness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in action , it &apos;s more than &quot; only &quot; a logo and a slogan , it continues . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a standing promise to form@@ ulate one , which gives the city a distinctive unique feature . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
&quot; a medium @-@ digit amount , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can cost their new roof brand and the campaign . &quot;
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear in front of the army
&quot; every year , at the beginning of August , Ankara &apos;s Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) came to reti@@ re and promotions in the Off@@ iz@@ ard cor@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
on the first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is a routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting took place no longer in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but at the minister of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the Government , the five vice @-@ Vice @-@ Chairman and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
so the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the number .
the government is moving into the military in the military .
&quot; Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were set off . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ duc@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the exile of the Ex@@ ile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ülen , the Erdo@@ gan as a wire @-@ driver of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , this week is passed in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow of &quot; God &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
&quot; in late February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ be@@ hagen in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general Staff , these concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army which mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the abol@@ ition of the head of the head for Sol@@ dier , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the big pur@@ ring in the army and the security forces goes out anyway .
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan issued a further 73@@ 95 state operators , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it seemed , when Erdo@@ gan was t@@ amed the military . &quot;
the gener@@ als were formerly known as the lords of the country .
&quot; three times , they embar@@ ked on their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world leaders . &quot;
&quot; following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pressed the power of the military step by step , not least with appeal to the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is targeted specifically for an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; an officer called &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; who sought refuge for asylum in fear of persecution in foreign countries , and the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; if this is the case , NATO could not have it cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , there is a doubt in the alliance to the pur@@ ge of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational skills be &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; NATO diplom@@ ats say . &quot;
Washington Chang@@ es the rules for Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; he looks forward to lower the leg@@ alized immigrants to 50,000 per year , more str@@ ingent regulations for the detection of visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by President .
the bill is to be discussed in the Congress of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the United States to change the way as the citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have English speaking the financial means to support themselves and knowledge who benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to renov@@ ate track for racing transportation
&quot; over the past few months , over the future of the speed@@ s@@ utt@@ les &apos; future had been fought - now it should go fast . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the year , the travel route will be built , on which the tourist trails will be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the speed@@ s@@ utt@@ les long @-@ term , according to the German Ministry of Transport , the construction work will begin on the track . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ race track to order and san@@ itation , the country is especially important to the tourism important link , &quot; declared public prosecutor Klaus S@@ ühl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the repair of the circuit , it was estimated at about 2.5 million euros . &quot;
&quot; of this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle should also be ordered in the future of the country , will currently be matched , explained S@@ ühl . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen train as operators are already involved in the technical details .
&quot; thus , the tim@@ etable and quality standards are negotiated , &quot; S@@ ühl said . &quot;
the planned agreement between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
that should be re@@ ordered by the race side@@ walk Shuttle on December 2017 .
the racing lane Shuttle is an especially popular train connection between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ es .
&quot; in the past few months , as part of a pilot operated , the distance of sufficient many people was used to order them regular again in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the route is very strong in parts . &quot;
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about .
&quot; just as you thought that in 2017 it cannot be crazy , a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start to take their ascent seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of ni@@ p@@ ples and the type of finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; people make it funny , but the companies deliver any quantity of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key when the release of his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed themselves from their infl@@ atable partners with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consci@@ ously human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adapt its robot according to its beliefs &quot; and select everything , from the eye color of the robot through the form of ni@@ p@@ ples up to type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; but there is still wor@@ r@@ ative , since many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; who would like to look a step@@ per woman of progressive . &quot;
modern sc@@ u@@ ppen have developed into robots using a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties , which they can be appe@@ aling like school@@ ing . &quot;
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of school@@ ing and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that has adjusted your personality as good as possible , &quot; the website is heated by True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
it also has its m@@ oods in the course of the day - just like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation , or it can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
there are many worried aspects of this rise of sex robot@@ ic - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the under@@ lies female properties that goes to rape when one goes one step to Fri@@ ed ( means : re@@ union ) Far@@ rah is worried about most .
&quot; true to his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy is committed to a vibr@@ ator but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it called on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , this sex robot isn &apos;t just a thread or just just another sex toys . &quot;
&quot; their orig@@ ination and their increasing refin@@ ement prove to something dark and low in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes to a desire for sex with signature as optional adding . &quot;
&quot; most men , of course , do not have sex robots , and while the FR@@ R remembers their rising popularity , they still remain at the edge of the consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what le@@ ak@@ eth out of the boundary zones can be in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very teaching . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange , or offensive , until the free market gives permission to this . &quot;
&quot; there is a certain exagger@@ ating that this highly developed sex robot in a time immer@@ se in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a pre@@ sidents in the White House who has managed to have attacked women sexually . &quot;
&quot; the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphical pictures , the worn body and the out@@ lay eyes , but how realistic this vision affects . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the objective behind this sex robot is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star pro@@ por@@ tions ) .
their builder want it to be human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , at the point when it comes to its &quot; personalities &quot; the robots represent no real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no placement or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything , which could distur@@ b the imagination of dead sub@@ jug@@ ation . &quot;
differently expressed : they are counter@@ feit slaves .
or to express it in the language of 2017 : maid service
tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to become the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human rights
&quot; it has become a binding of the tr@@ ump era that the political column , which have contra@@ cted the US voters , have also divided families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and harvest , there was newspapers in the United States newspapers with advice on how to circum@@ vent the horror of Tr@@ ump relations . &quot;
we all supposedly strict ourselves to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less notice , the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families combined . &quot;
&quot; I consider this because my cousin , a left @-@ minded poet that lives in Chicago and has long been working with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
they remembered that the unity must have a mighty effect against a common enemy .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House anyone who knows she knows , including Republican relative , which she fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls in a further context that this also brings considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the effect of its presidency has power to slide all of us to the right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gre@@ e possibility that we will no longer be able to stum@@ ble in one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there are still a few long @-@ term long @-@ time scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to his standards as an ep@@ it@@ ome of failure . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of the tra@@ verse - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - the two compared to Tr@@ ump in fact occur to a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only spiritual , to qualify as un@@ measur@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all C@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ y and the animals turn around , to watch full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the k@@ lim@@ per@@ ing music con@@ veys this on strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point a city : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines will become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not entirely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage , but the subject @-@ pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one of the round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could evaluate the Kar@@ us@@ sell , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for happiness afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to assess my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; at the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option , an average rating of 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also does pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was innocent , while I had tired the experience to spread my credit card with five stars . &quot;

&quot; last year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to his hand@@ joints , which he suffered the prison authorities according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence because of murder after an appeal by prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ ak@@ amp in the early morning hours of the Valentine &apos;s early hours by taking her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pre@@ toria on her .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he had his girlfriend for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal int@@ ru@@ der who had hidden himself in the cabin .
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they may be careful . &quot;
&quot; the National Prosec@@ ution authorities said that it will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objec@@ tion could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the attor@@ neys is successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
&quot; as a farmer , a strange egg finds &quot;

instead of a chicken ch@@ kens a small eagle came out .

&quot; the young were otherwise different than the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but also belong to this . &quot;

his purpose is to be free .
they wished every four @-@ t@@ kl@@ ets that he feels in his new school .
&quot; it ensu@@ ed Dank@@ es@@ word to the colleagues , former school@@ master Michael Müller , who always jumps on teaching pas@@ sports , and the parents represented . &quot;

&quot; they just leave their students after two years of lessons , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ t@@ kl@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; for the end , all students have a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;

software update for diesel vehicles : what the parties must now know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
&quot; at the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
&quot; they should improve the emission behaviour of the emission classes Euro 5 , and partly Euro 6 . &quot;
Euro @-@ 4 dies@@ els or worse are exemp@@ ted from it .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin at the ACE Auto Club Europe gives ass@@ essments :
is the new action mandatory ?
&quot; no , the executed software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates will be considered only for vehicles , the ECSC software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the power supply of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
manufacturers have announced an independent implementation in the next few months but not yet known for exact date .
he has informed that Daimler has informed anyone .
&quot; if it is due to an inspection , it will be done in their framework . &quot;
how long shall the upgra@@ ding spread altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the relation from the dedication of the manufacturer and from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen voluntarily , the autom@@ akers are not acting on the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could last in the workshop only three to four hours .
time elabor@@ ate could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do that do not drive a car by BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ? &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
&quot; presumably there would be foreign manufacturers , such as S@@ met@@ al@@ anine . &quot;
is now a massive price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears it .
&quot; but in the regions , where driving rates are dro@@ pping . &quot;
rural area there is no impair@@ ment for older diesel so far .
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for a sale yet .

we do the city li@@ ve@@ able
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes next year in R@@ ente . &quot;
the place is already written - suitable applicants are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been working for 31 years .
and work is still great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
&quot; he reports of varied , but demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor . &quot;
at the same time admir@@ ing him that no application for the requirement profile were compens@@ ated .
the town is searching for the next possible time an architect or building engineer .
so - at the contemp@@ t of regular termination periods - yet enough time for an elabor@@ ation .
&quot; since Has@@ lach was responsible for the administrative community as a sub@@ e building authority , the applicant has to present the corresponding connections . &quot;
because this function aims to keep the city definitely .
&quot; if they cannot fill them out , they would have to continue the citizens to advise until Offen@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity of the city and itself is important , says W@@ acker , who reports a good operating climate , as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; more than 30 years in office have accumulated some important projects , looking back to the h@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city of lively , &quot; it is safe over the building and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are based on the agenda : re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the low @-@ floor parking space . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ ds bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach becomes renewed , and the stadium restoration is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will strike roughly 1.5 million euros with a be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; if we make it right , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
work here is fun . &quot;
age @-@ related to a city building is present in a large game room .
&quot; with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and fermentation , it could be extremely flexible . &quot;
&quot; one can move much , so W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces are often comm@@ end@@ ingly mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye that fits , &quot; if new constructions are approved , st@@ resses the separ@@ ating city master . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ d has high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; at the end everything runs on my table here . &quot;
&quot; for assistance and coordination he can count on long @-@ standing staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing this for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been in the past 15 years . &quot;
&quot; even though his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain . &quot;
&quot; because continu@@ ity is not just important for a good operating climate , but also for the other design of the city . &quot;
&quot; who wants to bury Roland W@@ ack@@ ers , should have a degree in degree as a di@@ pl@@ omin@@ ous degree or bach@@ elor &apos;s field of architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and planning law . &quot;

bike on lines thrown : southern track .
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had the blue bicycle from the railway station in the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rators and look for them since the night hours after them .
&quot; near the crime scene , a ro@@ ar roll@@ ers and a bike driver had been observed . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ y , &quot; said O@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators , or the perpet@@ rators have brought himself in great danger and at risk of mig@@ rat@@ ory traffic . &quot;
&quot; besides the damage to the L@@ ok and the system , as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail vehicles could also come to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; a total of a &quot; considerable &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the south railway line could be led without any disability . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , nearly ten people were unusual , two of whom were related to the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; goods were not made , but they did not delay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ö@@ BB speaker , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 metres upper lines . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to relie@@ ve IB@@ D ( inflammation ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims the opposite : a diet which is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could relie@@ ve the symptoms of patients with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States , causing stomach cr@@ amps and ble@@ aching , recur@@ ring or ble@@ aching , loss of weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness . &quot;
&quot; while the affected are usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han found to develop immune cells , which promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hide in the body , not into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are capable of dis@@ solving inflammation , are extracted from cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without any sensitive tissue . &quot;
&quot; when the balance is incl@@ ined too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; in experim@@ entation , a type of tolerance grinding cell in mice occurs , which bear a certain bacter@@ ium in its in@@ wards . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich nutrition can be toler@@ ant , less anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system also work with humans . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral prizes in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immun@@ otherapy , which promotes tolerance as they found out that a group of study powers had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe , which had not been placed separately . &quot;
&quot; you susp@@ ects that the difference was to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ oms of mice , the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that usually live in the gastro@@ intestinal Tra@@ ct . &quot;
&quot; the mice of mice became DNA sequ@@ enced , and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells , but without them were missing in mice . &quot;
mice were tu@@ cked up in a ster@@ il@@ en environment so that they had not been a gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and did not developed this type of immune cells and they received the L. Cru@@ ter@@ i and the Imm@@ une Cell .
&quot; to understand how the bacteria effect on the immune system , researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then led small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - in@@ mature immune cells that were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; when active component of the liquid was cleans@@ ed , it proved to be a minor product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabolism which is known as the i@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerance to toler@@ ate cells like mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect themselves in our gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i found the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote , because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose Mour@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic .
&quot; in Manchester United has signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose Mour@@ in@@ ho believes his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the Chelsea started 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEFA Cup match against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and im@@ planted in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory @-@ Asia tour of the blues and was only 45 minutes to improve Mour@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve the start of the Premier League season before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks of football , &quot; &quot; Mour@@ in@@ ho said . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u also started the Avi@@ va Stadium in the Avi@@ va Stadium as Mour@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed in this week that Mour@@ in@@ ho had still three additional innovations , but he insi@@ sted that the club was already doing a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of his four priority re@@ signed . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , for this I thank the association , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four out of four , but they gave great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US @-@ aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers into the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but drawing in Marqu@@ ette in US state of Michigan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers across the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was a permanent test for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new underground blow for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; like the wind , however , the wind revol@@ ves : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was even the SPD head , the prime minister of the Prime Minister always looked to Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; merely no distur@@ bs from the party headquarters , merely no head@@ wind from the covenant , was the most important wish of the election fighting . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz takes the party , the fundamental change has changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the staff from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with increasing the events in the SPD @-@ reg@@ ated state capit@@ als . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has been in the beginning of the year since the beginning of the year , it would not be described in the approach . &quot;
there were underground .
and one after another .
&quot; following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal government sees a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can not be reliable . , CDU @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber said to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; the Prime Minister , Prime Minister , Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , over@@ threw a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the country @-@ election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green @-@ German leader Michael Kell@@ ner urged the ab@@ tr@@ al @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party of El@@ ke T@@ west to return their mandate .
the su@@ re@@ ation of the CDU means a clear dis@@ appointment of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ wins must immediately return their mandate , &quot; said the German leader and electoral campaign of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this may not be true , &quot; &quot; she sigh@@ ed a SPD election fighting than Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ ambassador &apos;s party headquarters . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green MPs El@@ ke T@@ wins to CDU without own government majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and no one knows what next comes .
the Mis@@ ere began with an unexpected defeat at the Saarland @-@ election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the Com@@ ra@@ ids qui@@ res themselves . &quot;
&quot; according to the State elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
it was then - and everything was clearly worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel , the SPD brought into the dive , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite took the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; in the weeks , the Com@@ ra@@ des returned to the weeks later . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had exhausted all new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next generation came out .
&quot; Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD Land@@ es@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus because he was sitting in El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie during the weekend . &quot;
&quot; and because he went into crisis communication then pretty much everything , what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z fights for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Weil .
&quot; due to the VW @-@ exhaust aff@@ aires and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Premier League has already been in cr@@ iti@@ que . &quot;
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tures were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps , in the past weeks , Weil tried to rely more and more strongly in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; comra@@ des of the former mayor of Hannover from Hanover , his power in Berlin , remained not hidden from Martin Schulz as well . &quot;
&quot; they left him , because they spoke of the stabil@@ isation of the party . &quot;
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Weil meets the interior of the Saxony @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party , basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz not even at all .
&quot; sometimes , comra@@ des therefore stri@@ ve to keep his own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is aimed at the green , and especially on the ab@@ rupt par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and Democrats mut@@ at@@ ingly , as Ms. T@@ life@@ jack@@ ed her own car@@ ri@@ cher over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party management in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ wins is not elected to its person as direct can@@ did@@ acy , but on the national list of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ vers . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters off four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil to the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Sax@@ on election to the Bundestag election to the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career thinking of a future CDU MPs predic@@ ts the election results , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot;
he asked to clarify the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there has been more or more further additions to the CDU Niedersachsen .
funding for the Ort@@ sk@@ ern III
&quot; who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years , can get support from the country soon . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , Mayor of Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative Ste@@ g urban development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a sight to the date until now . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , there have been in sens@@ ations areas . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the san@@ itation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the surplus was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous San@@ ali@@ z@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote interior development , and not only close new building areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , I received the information from the Government of Government in Karlsruhe , that there will be a renovation area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the congregation sens@@ ations . &quot;
how does a restoration work then ?
&quot; I will continue to investigate so ch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
but it also plays a role in which the planned area should be concerned at all .
&quot; at that time , the territorial limits could then move again once again . &quot;
&quot; the steak occurred on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; in the cellar , the content of the federal @-@ country program &quot; Social City , &quot; where the restoration would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the Rev@@ it@@ alisation of Inn@@ es , improving the residential and working conditions , and preser@@ ving the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; these measures would be objec@@ tion@@ ed , which is carried out per property . &quot;
&quot; finally , the rehabilitation area would then be defined as a stat@@ ute . &quot;
&quot; the approval period for funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 still until April 30 , 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; however , until September this year , however , the data intake would be performed only once more , as part of those involved in the restoration area involved a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the closing date must be made possible , so that in the coming year with the sanctions shall be started . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every Commun@@ e had to conduct the defined preliminary investigation .
&quot; it is about to assess the urban ab@@ normal@@ ities and decide when san@@ it@@ ates , and in what extent . &quot;
there will be also a renovation in the book for the respective plot .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sensation , and make a picture of the position , promised it . &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed that a major success factor for the project was the participation of the participation .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires which will be sent out to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and land arc &quot; &quot; where it works among other things around the structural condition and restoration views . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; can be made up to size , distribution and inhabitants of a living room . &quot;
the blue &quot; operating bow &quot; is only re@@ plen@@ ished if the premises are operated in the building .
&quot; however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a full @-@ filled questionnaire is not at the same time at the same time . &quot;
&quot; moreover , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler still emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funding for the &quot; &quot; Wind@@ dog Prin@@ ciple &quot; &quot; - who comes first comes first . &quot;
&quot; one could not reserve funding for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the end of the project , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; have been shown to make the rehabilitation of a rehabilitation . &quot;
British inventor itself sets a micro@@ chip to come with a hand@@ movement in house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , to open his home door , and can even start his car with a hand @-@ movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ ant@@ ated the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want their life with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Watson , an advisory an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ists in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , closed to ensure that the im@@ plant method is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a micro@@ chip cats and dogs only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the cost @-@ cost of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a navy helicopter for the South La@@ wn to fly to the South La@@ wn , cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the information of the military , which were left to the TIM@@ E Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire engine from Wisconsin and a fork lift truck was made in Connecticut . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before helicop@@ ters landed on the South La@@ wn , according to records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it &apos;s an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event , the deputy director of Aviation for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17th at 7 am , and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds , that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight . &quot;
&quot; during the event , the original flight crew was during the helicopter , while security personnel remained at the ground during the time on the ground . &quot;
&quot; the records provided by the TIM@@ E was not clear , whether a second flight crew should ultimately be required . &quot;
the Hatch Act prohib@@ its federal government to use state government for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could harm the determination .
&quot; a question we created was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; &quot; answered the Deputy Commander . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was described by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act . &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave a violation of the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to implement the government regulation . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advant@@ ageous purposes . &quot;
pre@@ sidents are oblig@@ ated to use them for the trip .
but its use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; Tr@@ ump introduced an investigation into February a study when the presidential jet was in front of the background of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages used by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is thr@@ illed by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states are showing , which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the vice @-@ saving of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn , to im@@ pose the U.S. President in the White House with precise centi@@ meter . &quot;
&quot; as a tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 exercise courses in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted an official event at the training requirement of the air@@ mark for the month , said an official . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew an additional 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support commis@@ sions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for no other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;
a spokes@@ man by S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in the helicopter to the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the Ministry of Defense for the Financial Year 2017 , the Do@@ D replacement for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
recordings of the unit contains the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of voting positions is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , funds for Do@@ D does not include personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press pre@@ cher of the White House defended Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things , which are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think as most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is reasonable to lift up . &quot;
&quot; it wasn &apos;t clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acts with the helicopter for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and scher@@ sted with the media about his own fleet of corporate products . &quot;
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of it . &quot;

&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are taken care of 45 week@@ day , are discussed at the K@@ ita at noon . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; after the 1st September kitchen service , you will heat up the angel@@ fish dishes , add them to the salad , raw food and fruits , Por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , rinse the food out , clean and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two group @-@ groups as well as seventh tro@@ op facilities - decides about the hour@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now part of the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier for the kit@@ sch line easier , ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
for this reason it is : healthy eating and cooking classes .
the children should help to prepare meals .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is as sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; they have known power in the K@@ ita , a person who tru@@ sts them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important to children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far as the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; in addition to quality improvement , this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also been the charm of the city &apos;s quality improvement in cost @-@ time comparison to the city as the most economical solution . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 partial forces are re@@ stopped . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the education field not so strong in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , a re@@ ig@@ ning head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are employed in the provinces in the provinces . three women can@@ did@@ acy for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ rated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be representative and credible if women are unable to participate in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5th .
&quot; the Taliban issued threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ de with the transition from international mar@@ tial arts to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , elections for the first time will be to power peace@@ fully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next time . &quot;
Hay@@ s@@ om said a strong role for women to become a democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan independent commission reports that 1.2 million women registered in total 3.6 million voters registered .

G@@ MB concerns about investment in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to make a deal with the managers of the Bis@@ c@@ ite @-@ producer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie for the long @-@ term commitment to the production in Glasgow .
&quot; G@@ MB Scotland said , &quot; &quot; the company looked at the future of investing in the T@@ oll@@ cross location . &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the work alongside other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea biscuits .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he invested more than 5 million pounds over the last years .
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives were &quot; first experienced , &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s Fili@@ al leader in the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s to express &quot; concerns that funding will not be driven by the moderni@@ zation of production lines .
&quot; G@@ MB Senior organizer Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win by General @-@ Site managers no clarity over the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , affects our members . &quot;
generations of families have worked here and labour force concentr@@ ates heavily on the local community and the large area of Glasgow - an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deteri@@ oration .
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of work@@ places , wage and prosperity , and before the background of the Bre@@ xit , the increasing cost of life and the chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow had strongly faced a floral production presence at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; a spokesperson for Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; &quot; the first director at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly on it because we estimate the ongoing commitment at employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had discussed a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , with which some questions openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we operate as all the companies involved in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , our business is constantly expanding - and this applies to all our business divisions and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operating improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the inheritance of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility and completely . should our business processes change at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , the PS@@ G Barcelona warned against Ne@@ ym@@ ar ? &quot;
the site of La Liga is their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain did not aband@@ on her persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after spending an offer of £ 189 million , but they have warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after the termination , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest professional sport@@ s@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way , as Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced his way to outside , although a source in the vicinity of the Catal@@ ans @-@ board insi@@ sts that the Club has always given its best to take care of him since his coming from Santos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G pre@@ sidents in front of this view ?
&quot; when Manchester City reported interest in the signature of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players to sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , whereby the Spanish association has been delighted to express interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow it to depart from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by having lost one of their price for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;
sco@@ ot@@ ers thrown and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , a well @-@ known perpet@@ r@@ ator has been deliberately cast a sco@@ oter one in the Königs@@ ef@@ ields in front of the estate number 30 and caused by more than 200 Euro to the covering of the vehicle . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for information . &quot;
&quot; to an accident at the B 215 , between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese seeks to witness the police . &quot;
&quot; because he came to him a car on his lane , the driver had to depart from a VW Tour@@ an and touch@@ eth the lead plan@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday night , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was arriving at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Stol@@ zen@@ au , Stol@@ zen@@ au reached him a car on his lane , so that he had to turn right after the right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an drivers touch@@ eth the lead plan@@ ks . &quot;
on the car was non @-@ harm .
&quot; the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had out@@ dated a truck and continued its journey without taking the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident damaged , it can be well aware that Mer@@ ced@@ es@@ hips didn &apos;t notice the accident . &quot;
&quot; the police now asks witnesses of the incident , as well as the driver of the we@@ ary artist , under Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 with the Com@@ miss@@ ariat of Stol@@ zen@@ au in connection . &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report dis@@ bur@@ sting Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows report about the abuse of the Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the regulatory sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ row continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wis@@ dom , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication against the German press agency , he acquired Bishop Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the retired Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , an exc@@ use . &quot;
&quot; it would be very useful to the appearance of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deepest regret about their own sub@@ missions , or their then false assessment of the trans@@ itions . &quot;
&quot; however , the Vatican Chancellor &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that during reporting on violence with &quot; two levels . &quot; &quot;
&quot; regarding the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , nobody doubt that it would have to be punished and com@@ promising actions , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Hist@@ orian , and Member of the National Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habits , the Catholic church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion to keep it normal , writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; we are happy to go to the church and this is another fres@@ hen . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they pointed out that in their youth &apos; stripes a very normal educational means &apos; were to be done with friends , as I was one , ready to be finished . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ fair to use today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appeared often . &quot;
&quot; totally wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; written in 12 languages ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; says E@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report published by the di@@ oc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; in total , 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows have been sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with a high pl@@ au@@ si@@ vity &quot; victims of survivors , 67 dom@@ spar@@ rows sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; summar@@ ize , that from Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and mental violence were applied . &quot;
&quot; just at high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be violent . &quot;
&quot; contrary to numerous other sign@@ posted , many victims were estimated to estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , E@@ emann , in the interview , explains why the final report on the regulatory sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has re@@ loaded his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; Incidents of Viol@@ in Exerc@@ ise &quot; &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for a lift , many students raise his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the other , it appears as a Chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became the Ö@@ f@@ teren , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has no top performance . &quot;
how do you assess this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found at all . &quot;
he had just eight sites devoted to him and he is clearly acquitted of each sus@@ pic@@ ion of Mitt@@ al or fellow workers in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
&quot; also , the violent action at the pre@@ school took place outside of its sphere of action . &quot;
&quot; one can dis@@ card him , if it is too late , or have not taken the first suggest@@ ion to have taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ estic School , on which he worked , was imp@@ acted by virtually all respondents as - as literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so also the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes an excellent witness , &quot; &quot; upright , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understand@@ able &quot; , &quot; the guys regularly supplied with cakes , cookies and bon@@ bons . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high per@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality that led to W@@ ut@@ qu@@ arri@@ es .
&quot; he didn &apos;t only threw himself with chairs and put the keys on the floor , but also ear@@ nest boys in hair or ears , he himself has been given to the hair , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and exc@@ used himself . &quot;
&quot; it has to be said to his Hon@@ our , however , that such gu@@ ardian methods in the frag@@ ile time , the 1960s and 1970s were widely used , with parents like teachers . &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each of us who was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also saw that in a world @-@ world@@ ly school , state schools . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually in this report , namely the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and violence on the pre@@ school , are free excav@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; it is already asking if it is not more to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ness and his role as the brother of Bene@@ dict XVI , that many media had just thrown on him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bavarian Pope , many who never understand him , still eag@@ erly . &quot;
but the truth is : the report granted Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s report in every way !
&quot; in the media , the report was reported much about the subject of mis@@ use at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Empire . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also be placed in the final report any transaction or abuse relating to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no only 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; I never told me to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said one aff@@ ection for the others , &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing with me . &quot;
&quot; the real problem with the En@@ lighten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they don &apos;t even trusted her parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do you assess the spar@@ row pupils R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated it : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he would have had real insight ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could stop the respective perpet@@ rators .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd , accept that it is just before it ... Bu@@ bs int@@ ru@@ sive or clear@@ er or rather opened , than against their parents , interfer@@ ing leaders , confidence instruc@@ tors etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that in the run of affected pupils and / or their surroundings , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free of charge by everyone . &quot;
&quot; thus , it cannot be charged with him , not to be prevented , or brought it to the ad@@ vert . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to bring his good names with these contradic@@ ted crimes , as unfortunately , in some cases . &quot;
in the media was much of &quot; violence to read &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Empire .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be seen in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the great problem that in the reporting everything was missing and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; there will be clean separately : between the pre@@ school and the high school of Dom@@ spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the incid@@ ents of incid@@ ents from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the cathedral @-@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test @-@ ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys of sa@@ dist@@ ish teachers were pri@@ cked and mal@@ icious , all of them were amazed at school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sk@@ andal@@ ous states must have been re@@ igns . &quot;
&quot; but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boy until his face when she had already been on the Dom@@ estic School . &quot;
&quot; it was like most witnesses emphas@@ ize , the topic of &quot; primary school &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise . &quot;
what was different in the Dom@@ estic School ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ w@@ ent violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; at most , the accus@@ ation remains to be looked away . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of all efforts , the report could define only two periods of time in which it was reported by the states on the pre@@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and from the predecess@@ ors at a school where he was not working and responsible for himself ( so the witness ) did not hear , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
swallowed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the In@@ sp@@ atz@@ ym@@ nasium who even re@@ produced the report . &quot;
&quot; in it , he points out this way , &quot; that during the primary school the test sentence would continue to be pract@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; already in view of the risk of negative press release , he received urgent income . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity were banned in Bavaria as a reference pen@@ alties in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they took place in a legal gray zone , as everyone knows from us . &quot;
&quot; it was also difficult for him , where the affected are exagger@@ ated or dramatic and where really the allow@@ able border had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but one can &apos;t say , it &apos;s always looked away . &quot;
that is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn und Taxis , yes , it was un@@ fair to address the standards of today &apos;s educational standards . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we speak histori@@ ans as from the &quot; &quot; Clo@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; which is the danger to assess past moral standards . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has already been right .
&quot; but this is not true for sexual abuse , who was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and also not for what was broken in the primary school and violence against innocent children &apos;s se@@ ams , which is already far beyond that time . &quot;
this is all horri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad that it finally works .
&quot; but at the same time , I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his funds for the disciplines of discipline and punishment , thus ear@@ nest and ears to pull , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , he also has stri@@ pped himself . &quot;
&quot; what image of his rainy days , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger gave you back to the discussion with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject of test penalty also came to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book , it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Bene@@ dict XV@@ I. tells of his perspective , the cathedral had played only one side role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in no way , no means that he led a str@@ ingent regim@@ ent there . &quot;
&quot; but also this must be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without these perfec@@ ting discipline , it would probably hardly have been possible to form a institution of Wel@@ tran@@ g , true cultural amb@@ ass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went to tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with cookies and bon@@ bons alone , one does not make any major singer and ever since success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ profit . &quot;
&quot; as what kind of man , you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks about their book ? &quot;
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and over again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deeply faithful and heart@@ ed people , from which one could not imagine that he could only do something in a fly . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m getting a regular contact with how many former dom@@ spar@@ rows still keep contact with him today , 23 years after his retirement , visit him - he is almost blind - and it is almost blind - and to treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who didn &apos;t forgive him today , so that he once was strict to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ spar@@ rows are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music .
&quot; and that he always had a good , happ@@ ier teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly that may be , but also a lov@@ able respec@@ t@@ sper@@ son , to which they still look up and to honour them today . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that one throws it , are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda . &quot;
we can be glad that we have already overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and a more prominent brother has to make a medi@@ al sin @-@ goat . &quot;
&quot; it is the evil intention that stands behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; because the report , which was just released , has re@@ loaded him . &quot;
&quot; now the status @-@ area would have had a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great service and without the outside of Bay@@ ern@@ ity and perhaps Germany , probably no one could know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Empire in peace . &quot;
