<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Münch promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not currently.</seg>
<seg id="7">"that knows everyone who had already had to be exciting, because the car Navi instead of a strapping road instead of a green meadow."</seg>
<seg id="8">"historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlas, an offer of the geoportas in Bavaria of the state government, are all other than currently - yet very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"then, as towns and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a flickepad that cannot be recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the large overlook card were labelled for cities and communities more detailed maps, so-called urine leaves."</seg>
<seg id="13">"these were created according to the Bavarian Surveyor Administration between 1810 and 1864, and skipped the first surveying of the first surveying."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the French army leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800, during the Second coalition war with Austria."</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bayernin order - of course to military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"finally, when French troops moved with the peace of Lunéville, February 9, 1801, it was the present-day neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max. Joseph drove the project further, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thereby the Bavarian Surveyor Administration."</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositional sheet for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like all other at the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the early morning / today, the state capital is the most impressive."</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"one example is subsendling, which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after preparation of the map, i.e. in 1877, as the Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of entrepreneurs are concentrated along the current plinganserstraße in 1856, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian farmers in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing as fields - at the first glance: in the zooming appears a smaller part card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten entries from the so-called" urine "which was derived from the basic tax."</seg>
<seg id="27">"there are no farmers there today, but small husbandmen of the plant" Land in Sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green surface is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 was the scene of the October of October, was still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the position of today, one reads in the district of the today district Au-Haidhausen, only the street names" at the host "or from the height" on the air "- but also in large letters" Irish Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once bulged people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there, in 1858 / 59, the Munich District-Irrenanstalt" was created "On Auer Lüns." "</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden conducted the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and finished, for example, the chains of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has prohibited the personnel to apply violence against the occupants," "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was first place for 280 patients, and later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatristons."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet with the Munich Salesanum."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the Order has acquired the building complex in 1920, and went into a youth home with training."</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football field of TSV München East, east of residential houses in the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco, "built in architectural approach to the origins of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was in 1856 as the" main square "," the Kaufingerstraße called "Kaufinger alley." "</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Münch.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allied bombs were cut to the city center in December 1944."</seg>
<seg id="47">A great one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the British Institute, small business houses and a tomb of the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof, where these days are working and on 5 April 2017 the spatenstich on the second S-Bahn."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the Sliberegler, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Society publishes itineraries for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Union to promote Farmers has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling due to discriminating policies and racist attacks in the state after Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Advisory Board is supposed to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourianer, where a number of fragile, cash-based incident occurred in the entire state and noted here," says it in the opinion of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people harder to gain discrimination, as well as the enforcement agencies of the state that deplying the Group to admit the disprouting, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of the civil rights, which people pass."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are recruited because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist criminals against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"in the beginning of the year, Sanders died of unquestionable circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no petrol more and taken away by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also shows a recently published report by the Office of the General Atarist Office, where it is shown that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more frequently than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are consciously aware and informed about their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be willing to bring it to the Caucasus, or to know the relatives that they are travelling through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded in 2015 in the year 2015, after the recent figures from the FBI's refusal report to the FBI, which in regard to the number of violations of the country's number of injuries on the 16th number of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to accuse a company because of housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona since the States adopted immigration authorities to forgive people due to immigration, which will contribute to the ACLU's view."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are generally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times the intervention of the measure was deployed to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Reverse-project is essential</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing bacher incense project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU / German Parliament Peter White and Kordula Kovac have produced a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the right excavation of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the fishing ban had met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann granted him first insights into his farm, where he offers 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many virals."</seg>
<seg id="72">"Schwarzwald's milk" is for him the aging travel route for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Ferihest comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also the BLHV-Chairman of Fisbach, he described the reverse project as" elemental "." "</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't profit this way steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"green space for plenty of work, much must be processed with the engine sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here with the conditions and to fight topography," Schwendemann emphasized. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the eleventh operation and maintained this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not lead biooperation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune recognized the meaning of the decimal project and is happy to promote leader. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, the farmers had to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">"one hope so, that the restoring of the areas could still be pulled out for a while."</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure that we have, are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation," stressed the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often standing because of promoting criticism in critique</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the open area of the open space is 40 hectares, which can be kept up to at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leader was promoted, a quarter wore the municipality of Fisbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"consequently, the farmers spent 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of Weifence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of fences," declared Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" you do not make a good job, without farmers and women. "</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White: "the best food produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The state tax relief (lpr) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of mfences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim of the Schwarzwald's disclosure.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the lpr subscribers.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the fenced area should not be infiltrated (slope above 35 percent) and must be threatened with restoring."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fishing ban on the fishing project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the open area covers 35 hectares, the resulting cost is over 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans also appreciate this like any other - therefore the care of Saddam Hussein staged on the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN using the proposals for the drastic restriction on the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller does not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">"a horde of boat beaters and Liberty Imiters would have voiced it, if he had done it."</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid out its significance, and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta complained:" I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightened the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you refer to that later was added later, and not part of the original statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporatory words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the arms of the poor:" your labour, your poor, and your thronged masses who continue to breathe freely, / or to breathe out of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elting waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller didn't engage in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who wanted to make her words back to their death on the basis - were very good that they completed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">"the sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicans, showing the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classical visual representation."</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus changed this importance, in its poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is also a very different name: mother of Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change from the right wing this long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big screwing as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty came in, but rather an early Neocconservatives to bring the American flame into the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is going forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not to shine the way into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">"quite unusual, Limbaugh is seen here on something."</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great phantascertained indeed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, elting, but hopeful people after long and often horrible voyages on the ships of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the true sense that the world emerges from the perspective of people who seek refuge, and make a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">"their statue speaks to them the words of hope, and of the welcome that they have to hear."</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not to recognize the perspective, Miller and Trump."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch shall not shine the way, but the hatred that is the only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when just two Schots were to be the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the power director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of the World Championships were awarded a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athlete was selected for London in 2017, which starts on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland developed something special" and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue to find out until we'll find out," "Black said."</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak to people in Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">Scottish athlete think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several Scottish athlete are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah while Eiliie Doyle's team was elected team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling of course brought Eiliie quite natural, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal winner that will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it is" unbelievably "that 16 Schots are in the British crew."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the world championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-streak Muir performs on this road and has set up five British records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will be part of the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another hote, one after a great season, which took the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers their first world championships when the only other Scotsman was in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the maneconomists say that they are" enormously proud "to the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also among medals and at the Finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about to be team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and have chosen me something special for me," "she added."</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to podia."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech affects as a capitalist?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">"so, it is really important to sit on this home support and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it will be just like a great atmosphere there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critics on Facebook: do not complain about a public office if you cannot bear the preheating of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers killed him for all, from inner policy to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he chimplies with the criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783 Washington said," The freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid, and mute, as sheep are led to the slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland Larry Hogan, who has to work with it, to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans staff have blocked contributions from at least 450 people and deleted their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union appealed him to this week at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the staff of the Governor dismissed the lawsuit as a frivoly, and the online comment was full of a counterreaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," many people said. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second-highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is no reactionary Hitzkopf.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playing his hair-loose head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, blocking of persons who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which is considered officially called and of employees working with public tax dollars - unnecessary, and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Speaker Amelia Chasse he argued the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments are nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too simple to use the images of trolling or spouses, or hassorted people that vibrate online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments are respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post office and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., was not hassable, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I said that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hasselt and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news program "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people on the same subject matter, then they are discounted by some more than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what were the employees of the governor as" concentrated Spam-Attack, "would probably call" intercession "." "</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic, or delete a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in previous time when you had done the same thing, that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical ladders and to burn protesters and silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that happens right.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials to criticise that he has criticised Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is expelled by Twitter users who have blocked from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County promised the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, as they proclaimed a voters off their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had an similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers tolerated between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous counselors struck his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even back then Washington had anonymous anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms such as" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "wrote, wrote all the letters to newspapers that make Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"Petitioning, which criticized his position on the treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his position, according to historical documents that were collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't put them into silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, opinion of expression, and discourses belong to the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guiding means to accept this.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 by a great house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I spent in love and made a special offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a snowy layout - it had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add joanne storage space and a mezzanine add to the spacious ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted to have high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi in Notting Hill to make the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to place one another, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which you could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to be creative to solve the submission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel structure is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on each other, without having to gaps."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just a simple platform to build a simple platform, but to make the steel so that it had the right level up or down the right height."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of retrouvius looks down across the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of skewers plays a role in adding theatres, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to leave him longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, reflections feels like a window in another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the corner and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, furniated MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is essential so that if you slide the door, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could win an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, real estate agents will enter and carry out a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they managed to enlarge the floor space and to use high-quality materials that make the room its luxurious benefit."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and therefore helping to create an emotional binding in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not forget the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be changed through good design and increased square meterations from something standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"indeed, like Joanne, could you decide to leave this."</seg>

Johnson, who accused the deputy chief butcher of Katie Walsh, to be the source behind a heap of leaks at the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson has been banished for chicans permanently from Twitter, or that he has no concrete evidence, or that he expressed false accusations in the past."</seg>

<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former Staff of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>

<seg id="1535">"the melting of Schelfeira and Eisberg increases the sea level not because they swim on the water, and ice as much water as it results in the melting itself."</seg>

<seg id="1817">"there are no rest of violence, and while throughout the country the corpses are frequent, more journalists are at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto had his office in December 2012, and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"the latter is her editor and her inspirator of Rioce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is deeply impressed, although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which depicts his middle finger with the word" Justice ". two reporter in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-Shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop will take place in less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared topics, trauma, its nightmares, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although the Prosecutor's Office was erected in 2010 to work the cases of journalists, these according to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders, each year with drug retailers and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely presented in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Rioce, they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are intraterally east and even though the terrain is still more angry."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without righteousness, the meeting at the discussion of safety, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid, my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we suspect all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of Rioce's office in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was shot from his car and was shot at him for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - the" twelfth river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove off in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on Valdez's theme there is practically no silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans had been arrested last year and the extradition of the United States in January was to fight for one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"there is nothing that in Sinaloa anyone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of embellished, two-story mausoleums for drug-controlled who are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"for a minute that there is a state of" rest "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60) is a co-founder and director of Rioce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first in February, the publication of a interviews with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, they probably bought each copy of the output, as soon as she was delivered to newspaper kioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second bug was to force Valdez, after the seizure of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country on its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues did that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he was together with five colleagues for the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism, without encounter the glow poison problem, "Bojorquez said."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"at the time, the newspaper earned a call for the courageous and honest coverage, and the turnover and advertising took place."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it to publish hard-end investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else had to deal with."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Rioce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Award "for their reporting in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history, where she also led them."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug dealers in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "said he in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You must take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do with so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Rioce team missed Valdez, the Spaak-bird, who was like a dockworker, the friend who was generously with hugs and Counts, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he always would go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, walking and sitting there on the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now she asks, Is his love to be a routine?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also has forced them to ask her own assumptions about how they can do their work best, and they can stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you are dealing with their women, their children, their clean stores, their home starting and landing ways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," Bojorquez said. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-risk and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instinable.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it doesn't smell, stay away."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" smell a sense that can be deceived... and then it happened with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, such as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrust smuggle, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed. days before it was announced that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Two policemen seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Rioce in a four-storey building in a middle class of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the scherz, some of the reporters asked whether these officers are among the 50 percent of the policemen who are governor themselves as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug parties de facto are under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Rioce has clicked on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">It was the assassination of the brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the state expenditure, concentrated on the hometown of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group that took place in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor's Office."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who has been kidnapped, or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled nearly all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporters to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, readers would have liked the column of Valdez as the best informed source of the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously we knew what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" El FLACO "because of its slim body muscles."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office has been dedicated to the storage room for signs and sticker, dedicated to the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they would never have expected, activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snatched a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalist at the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the Western State of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and civil servants, based on DNA tests that it is his."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists were stronger than they were written in organised protests" SOS Press "for walking and construction."</seg>
<seg id="1891">This day is the director Bojorquez in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to deliver journalists and kill it because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then she has asked for ever since she is worried about the government, because she is concerned that their rage has hurt their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organizing crimes, involved in government officials and an equal society." "</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his final book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters won't only be killed by drug trafficking, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces, linked to organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media group" Articulo 19 "was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you die because they want that you hold the mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the killings have a terrible effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgetting the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern boundary state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by Zetas-Kartell:" here I am because of my reports. "</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphone were standing apart from their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondents MIROSLAVA Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to make El manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly set up the drug ticket with an editorial in the title page with the heading" What do you want from us? "</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists are escaped from their home state or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is difficult to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and seek to dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are chased, as it is evidenced by the photographer Reuben Espinosa, who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who continue back and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, announces that the drug retailers are troubled."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell and therefore I became reporter," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight last Friday, when the last edition was finished, the editors of Rioce sitting on the sidewalk before the office and drank beer when all their telephones began to summing up all their phones."</seg>

<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they didn't show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the staff of Rioce followed its tracks."</seg>

<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "called it as" the "held dinosaurs, who ever was found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier, who lived in the middle of the chalk time between 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well preserved condition, researchers that characterize it as" truly remarkable ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eaters is the best preserved bays of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Radio when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, at 21 March 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met on something similar to the surrounding rock out of the square, and decided to look closer."</seg>
<seg id="1932">He discovered the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all these hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you have blinking only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is visible. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is used in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs specimens, mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found that this plant-eaters, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a wall tank, probably threatened by flesh-vores dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly formed dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves from predator, and used a parachuting technique that is used as counterattack, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have been allowed to mix well in its surroundings and to soften its enemies, experts say what it indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"the 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurier, made headlines for the first time in May, is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours in order to discover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing conservation of specimen enabled it by Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armaments about his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"she discovered the countershading, a widespread defense method in the animal realm, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than their underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the condition is customary, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta exceeds by far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs was chased enough pressure by the eaters of Dinosaurs, that evolution represents the wear of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals, which use the counter-shading - do you think of Rehe, Zebras or Gird - are much smaller and harm than prey that signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real battle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, strongly harvested dinosaurs show how dangerous to have been the dinosaurs predatory of the chalk time," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scals also shows that the skin of the dinosaur rotr was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on hints about his life, including his brain Darminhaltes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs died when he died, into a river, and cast into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was so warm as south florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland as they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable, because it is completely covered with consered skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of animal retains," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal today looks almost as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need a lot of imagination to redesign it. if you are just a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when huge Theropods, carnivorous Dinosaurs, that stood on two legs, crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the King of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of its furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this is one of the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tonnes heaviest monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta has sank after death in the sea and mumified in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Radio when he died on March 21, 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the retained dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from muzzle to hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were averaged around 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes taken by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant-eaters was pushed through the western Canada, until an flooded river was flooded into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"but the underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite item detail."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the remnants of this special specimen, so well preserved, that the skin care still cover hollow tank plates along the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"like Michael Greshko for National Geographic, it is such a level of conservation so 'rarely as a profit in Lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"hidden remnants of the skin still cover the hollow tank panels, which carry the skull of the beast."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right front foot lies on his side, his five fingers crossed up."</seg>

<seg id="1976">"on the exact number of injured persons, no data were first published."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it came to light to moderate injuries, said a polzeal precher."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A big boost to rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group testing "Comfort Check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing is being sitting on the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or you are deeper into his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffered.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the Schaffner and wakes an uncleft or rips the gast in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of breaks are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the smart ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1994">"it is simply confirmed by mobile phone, that one should be taken at his place, and makes the ticket."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"at present, a test run is running on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer comes, we extend it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it is expected to be available to many other routes in Germany at the beginning of this year," "said a railway speaker."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort check-in" calls the railway line devaluation without Schaffner.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"to use the advantage, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to booked an online ticket - what's going to do most passengers already.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it also has to be purchased over the app by rail, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket buckets."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And finally you need a seat space.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "comfort check-in" works as follows: one increases in the train calling his ticket under "My tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">"with the test customers, then a button to the electronic devaluation."</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train managers get on their mobile devices a message that Fahrgast X has taken on the train and taken the booked seat platz Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"comes the train conductor at No. Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already an online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue reading, continue working, keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"the" check-in "has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the rail, which is to use the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel without a ticket check through our train personnel, check the DB Navigator itself."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this enables the passengers to design their travel time in the train of personal," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Management of DB Telecommunications. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second Plus: "and our employees have more time than today to meet the individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">"who often goes train, knows that in addition to delay and missed trains the roadmap controls belong to the greatest offences."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"for often, one of the travelers do not need any documents in any case, which one needs to be used for the devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document must be given.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the consequence are endless discussions between train managers and Fahrgast, which leads to bad mood in the aboutor and delays during the control of your own tickets, taking the Schaffner at the end time to take care of other concerns."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this is also only on connections with ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Additional train numbers on the same circuit are not unlocked.</seg>

<seg id="2034">"that is not common," Ferrell reminded of her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the kind of murder, which we have used to ourselves and we can call it typical."</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt shoots.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">"she booked a return flight, and went home the next day."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23: 00, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two next morning to Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "" in the cinemas from the 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the point of view, living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two have a conversation which they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and black condition. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember, as I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" do they remember what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go to Ferguson, because the police killed 18 year-old boys and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take it," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">"it must know, and it will see and be tucked up."</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also know the different layers of black experience and black Constitution and what we need to do to free to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she is not a eklatant racism, it is not different than the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I feel the feeling, I would give it a bad service to keep them off."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when she arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police office, which was at a camp area, when the activists had waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business partner, had lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">"they prepared bags, and helped to pass on demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began a new type of activism for Ferrell's form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed after the 9th of August, she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food justice and health qualities in black municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan told her, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to Ferrell in the sense:" will you document or try to find a story that you can use? "</seg>
<seg id="2061">"these scepticism has been nourished by countless cases of people, often from white - in a community that benefited from pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently declared in an interview:" we heard that people who have been born in Ferguson and raised up their voices, and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for its activism on death prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"the project was getting closer together, together with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we speak," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the aim was to concentrate on Ferrells's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah, but for a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious participation in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprising personal aspects of Fertility's life as she loves and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that in this work, and in the realisation of black people there must be a certain level of injuries."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells has repeated the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the Movement, which after killing the black teager trayby Martin in 2012 marked the film" "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identifies as gay. "</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in executive positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting with different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that," the movement really is held by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an emative type of action "in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, even though it was on the front line, because with a life on these cruises as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense its energy through the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson has long disappeared, but the racial connections between the congregation and the police continue."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless she klammates in a song and she feels obliged to this memory, since she went on the street three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "Orwahn": TV readers discuss with bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves the people, although it is not yet built."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the end of the pedestrian zone has been outdated since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the topic can hardly have one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The theme is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" on our Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"as one of the bit gallery say:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" it doesn't need a person "" (Siggi Bnets) or simply: "" wahn! "" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the proponents build that a gallery draws more customers into the city, of which also the other shops benefit, fear the adversaries that then haemorates the pedestrian zone."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery is planned exactly on the premises, on which the farmstead stands, in which 13 direct marketers can offer its products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work is concluded with the beginning of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the gallery Macher wants to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to Beda-Platz, with possibility to sitting outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"Simone Room:" "we've been buying almost weekly in the farmstead for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the land women are very happy again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's butcher.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, there is also this."</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketers in a market hall in the gallery comes to the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"the new project, however, should not be low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the most shopping mall in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothing, shoes, drooping - or supermarkets: I think this is superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are enough enough of it in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many cargo shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but here, however, there is not even a regular weekly market, it is the more important that we will stay at least the Markthalle."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered are fresh, is generally offered directly from the producer and is obendably priced."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shop transactions are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies, because the dorm Mietes are often not contractual for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special stores are almost no longer and what is left, will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where should the farm market stands during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">Old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the bit gallery occurs at some point.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghosts bit gallery already distribute all the shops of Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and there is no one shopping center, which is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"after my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farm market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But there's no place for a farm market in Bitburg thanks to the wahny of many - how I find a good construction projects in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmstead is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A right similarity: artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which depend on the ceiling of the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"the 30 portraits were sent by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuplift and haircut, which you were sent by Chelsea Manning."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analytics sent a 35-year prison term after she publicly made diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks site."</seg>
<seg id="2128">A new exhibition opened on 2 August is A Becoming Resemblance (A fitting similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was united in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgression, and pioneering dissidy, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg created the DNA analysis of the DNA that has been extracted from Manning, and created out of the 30 portraits, like someone with this genomic data could look like a sharp comment, as well as something intellectual comments can be created, and inherent determinism of this interpretations - but also to the identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has been openly spoken of the identification as a woman, was convicted in 2013 for 20 accusations, including six violations of the spying law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only a single photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinblonde perverse - with whom it was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in it, the artist portraits of strangers from forenish artifacts like cigars and chewing gum produced by producing the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what these people might look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were added to unequal letters that exchanges several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic strip" Supported images, "which would be able to convert a future in which the President of the Chelem judgement would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manners release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome way of happy gathering."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there are also now at the opening of the exhibition a little bass and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the warehouse and against Transgender troops to find new, tweetely ways to fix the rigid divisions that he should resolve further."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the weird timing of all these things, she said that" things are going to happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the Galerie's artistic testimony called Manning with her superior signature, including the" i "in their family name is an end of the" automatic disintegration, whose foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence is written - a thousanding of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological respects."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away, is that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories is also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in an own room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"it shows Manning, as it emerges with a hands-free float in the hand of the United States like King-Hong Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they chill your speech in cold, then they have won."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never forget the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came straight from a letter which she wrote to me," "the artist said from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get geese, when I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was foreseen in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be greeted by their own genomic simulls that are summarized as hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Mannings Stature) in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had it on the wall, but I wanted it to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2267">"the compromise away from the two days is more than one day, in which the Bruins moved almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six playing time in Westwood offers practical exercises."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes that was based on a archive: it wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpectedly emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only reacts on the Daughter print on the side of a letter, which was written by a double player in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>

<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who smitten so with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived nearly four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have a little overrated") this all seems too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days to explore the Victorian" new "castle, study the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the monarched heads of walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscape-care, gardener and sometimes with the artists, who worked at the illustrations of his book."</seg>

<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was only received the full access in 2006 when the last time I am, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>

<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a riot that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes. "</seg>

<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start to take their ascent seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of nipples and the type of fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make it funny, but the companies deliver any quantity of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr Sharkey when the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed themselves from their inflatable partners with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adapt its robot according to its beliefs" and select everything, from the eye color of the robot through the form of nipples up to type or color of his fingernails. "</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but there is still worrative, since many robots have the" personalities "who would like to look a stepper woman of progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern scuppen have developed into robots using a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties, which they can be appealing like schooling."</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah" which conveys the impression of schooling and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that has adjusted your personality as good as possible," the website is heated by True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">It also has its moods in the course of the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed on conversation, or it can be" in mood "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worried aspects of this rise of sex robotic - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underlies female properties that goes to rape when one goes one step to Fried (means: reunion) Farrah is worried about most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"true to his website, True Companion Roxxxy is committed to a vibrator but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" is it called on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, this sex robot isn't just a thread or just just another sex toys."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their origination and their increasing refinement prove to something dark and low in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes to a desire for sex with signature as optional adding."</seg>

<seg id="2417">The objective behind this sex robot is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builder want it to be human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, at the point when it comes to its" personalities "the robots represent no real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammation)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims the opposite: a diet which is rich in flesh-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with anti-inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States, causing stomach cramps and bleaching, recurring or bleaching, loss of weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the affected are usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan found that the essential amino acid tryptophan found that the essential amino acid tryptophan found to develop immune cells, which promote a tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hide in the body, not into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are capable of dissolving inflammation, are extracted from cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without any sensitive tissue."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the balance is inclined too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in anti-inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experimentation, a type of tolerance grinding cell in mice occurs, which bear a certain bacterium in its inwards."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance. "</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of Tryptophan rich nutrition can be tolerant, less anti-inflammatory bomilieus, if the same system also work with humans."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral prizes in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immunotherapy, which promotes tolerance as they found out that a group of study powers had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe, which had not been placed separately."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"you suspects that the difference was to do with the intestinal microbioms of mice, the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal Tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice of mice became DNA sequenced, and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were tucked up in a sterilen environment so that they had not been a gut microbiome and did not developed this type of immune cells and they received the L. Cruteri and the Immune Cell.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria effect on the immune system, researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then led small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - inmature immune cells that were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when active component of the liquid was cleansed, it proved to be a minor product of the tryptophan-metabolism which is known as the idol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance to tolerate cells like mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect themselves in our gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan side products from L. reuteri found the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote, because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri lead to an extension of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2729">"the" "Made in America" "event was described by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act."</seg>

<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Eemann, in the interview, explains why the final report on the regulatory scandal at the Regensburger Domsparrows Georg Ratzinger has reloaded his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "Incidents of Violin Exercise" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for a lift, many students raise his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"in addition to the other, it appears as a Choleriker and perfectionist who became the Öfteren, when a Domspatz has no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you assess this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you make the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger is found at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He had just eight sites devoted to him and he is clearly acquitted of each suspicion of Mittal or fellow workers in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">"also, the violent action at the preschool took place outside of its sphere of action."</seg>
<seg id="2916">"one can discard him, if it is too late, or have not taken the first suggestion to have taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domestic School, on which he worked, was impacted by virtually all respondents as - as literally -" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes an excellent witness," "upright," "competent," "competent," "competent" and "understandable", "the guys regularly supplied with cakes, cookies and bonbons."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about its perfectionism and its high permotionality that led to Wutquarries.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he didn't only threw himself with chairs and put the keys on the floor, but also earnest boys in hair or ears, he himself has been given to the hair, deeply regretted and excused himself."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"it has to be said to his Honour, however, that such guardian methods in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s were widely used, with parents like teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each of us who was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also saw that in a world-worldly school, state schools."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and violence on the preschool, are free excavators."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"it is already asking if it is not more to do with his acquaintness and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media had just thrown on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian Pope, many who never understand him, still eagerly."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report granted Georg Ratzinger's report in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, the report was reported much about the subject of misuse at the Regensburger Empire."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger will also be placed in the final report any transaction or abuse relating to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No only 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never told me to talk to my father or mother about it," "said one affection for the others," It was all very embarrassing with me. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem with the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they don't even trusted her parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you assess the sparrow pupils Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it: "concerning sexual abuse... I don't see any case in which he would have had real insight (Georg Ratzinger) and could stop the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd, accept that it is just before it... Bubs intrusive or clearer or rather opened, than against their parents, interfering leaders, confidence instructors etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" that in the run of affected pupils and / or their surroundings, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free of charge by everyone."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, it cannot be charged with him, not to be prevented, or brought it to the advert."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to bring his good names with these contradicted crimes, as unfortunately, in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media was much of "violence to read" at the Regensburger Empire.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will be seen in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem that in the reporting everything was missing and mixed up to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"there will be clean separately: between the preschool and the high school of Domsparrows, between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the incidents of incidents from the time since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the cathedral-atzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test-pedagogy, the cases where boys of sadistish teachers were pricked and malicious, all of them were amazed at school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really skandalous states must have been reigns."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boy until his face when she had already been on the Domestic School."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"it was like most witnesses emphasize, the topic of" primary school "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the Domestic School?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sawent violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at most, the accusation remains to be looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but in spite of all efforts, the report could define only two periods of time in which it was reported by the states on the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and from the predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible for himself (so the witness) did not hear, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Swallowed Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Inspatzymnasium who even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in it, he points out this way," that during the primary school the test sentence would continue to be practised. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in view of the risk of negative press release, he received urgent income."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when legal clarity were banned in Bavaria as a reference penalties in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they took place in a legal gray zone, as everyone knows from us."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was also difficult for him, where the affected are exaggerated or dramatic and where really the allowable border had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one can't say, it's always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria from Thurn und Taxis, yes, it was unfair to address the standards of today's educational standards."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we speak historians as from the" "Clostrick of Anachronism," which is the danger to assess past moral standards. "</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this is not true for sexual abuse, who was abhorred at all times, and also not for what was broken in the primary school and violence against innocent children's seams, which is already far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I'm glad that it finally works.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his funds for the disciplines of discipline and punishment, thus earnest and ears to pull, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he also has stripped himself."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image of his rainy days, Georg Ratzinger gave you back to the discussion with you for the book" My brother of the Pope "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of test penalty also came to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book, it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI. tells of his perspective, the cathedral had played only one side role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, in no way, no means that he led a stringent regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but also this must be said: without these perfectionism, without these perfecting discipline, it would probably hardly have been possible to form a institution of Weltrang, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went to tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with cookies and bonbons alone, one does not make any major singer and ever since success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-profit."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"as what kind of man, you have experienced Georg Ratzinger in the talks about their book?"</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I met Georg Ratzinger really well and over again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply faithful and hearted people, from which one could not imagine that he could only do something in a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I'm getting a regular contact with how many former domsparrows still keep contact with him today, 23 years after his retirement, visit him - he is almost blind - and it is almost blind - and to treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who didn't forgive him today, so that he once was strict to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domsparrows are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always had a good, happier teacher - a stringent father, certainly that may be, but also a lovable respectsperson, to which they still look up and to honour them today."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all that one throws it, are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have already overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and a more prominent brother has to make a medial sin-goat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"it is the evil intention that stands behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"because the report, which was just released, has reloaded him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the status-area would have had a 93-year-old man who had acquired great service and without the outside of Bayernity and perhaps Germany, probably no one could know the Regensburger Empire in peace."</seg>
