Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star in an interview is un@@ mistak@@ able now .
&quot; I will always put in drawers , or receive from the outside label , which with me and the reality usually have little to do . &quot;
&quot; myself , I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather s@@ nap . &quot;
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mopolit@@ an . &quot;

Gol@@ fer Lang@@ er receives the pyramid pyramid
his experiences on the horse are covered .
&quot; at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lang@@ er sought a little variety with some colleagues with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses were remin@@ ded of their holiday evening , they were hunting in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feed comfort . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er . &quot;
and then the riding career ended up again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament victories - again in the vicinity of horses . &quot;
&quot; he left his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he could not write to photo purposes . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and thus at CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was totally convincing .
the German sports aid donated the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports pyramid .
there is no lack of awards to the sympath@@ etic athl@@ ete .
&quot; guided tour , silver bay leaf , Champions @-@ tour players of the year ... &quot;
even British Queen has already ge@@ ared him .
long is the 18th winner of the pyramid of pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner of Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award tells me a lot , &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; for she won &apos;t only forgive for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lang@@ er promotes the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ fold US master winner was captured on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the athletes include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ly , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Peter Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ ö@@ hle and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard . &quot;
many of these sporting activities came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , illustr@@ ate the illustr@@ ate society into the Spring@@ stadi@@ on where the Lav@@ az@@ za Prize was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lang@@ er was walking distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy compared to it : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - that , both Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , the two US presidential elections , however , are one of the control and energy policy as well as in a basic question . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton lies a fundamental , more philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
that is about the role of the state .
&quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubt rather small in doubt and warns against the state of the economy , with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to export the economy to death , and regulate to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; it himself would be quite different , claiming Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will return regul@@ ators massi@@ vely , and he makes itself strong tax reform with lower tax rates - for private professionals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , says : the State has certain tasks to be fulfilled , he has opened its privileged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would be increased , says it . &quot;
&quot; Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the needs to be invested , tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost wor@@ t@@ ely . &quot;
the Democratic Can@@ didate announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical tea wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; so , on Tr@@ ump , there might be still part@@ ition@@ ing internal discussions . &quot;
more significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and cross the coal extraction in the US .
oil extraction should also be possible in so far @-@ protected areas to termin@@ ate the Paris climate agreement .
&quot; in contrast , Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of the clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other .
&quot; PP , the S@@ PP @-@ fish trade agreement , they don &apos;t want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US would not want to is@@ olate from international trade - but just to protect American jobs . &quot;
they should then be paid even better . Clinton demands .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger @-@ wage . &quot;
he wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
&quot; what is to do in this question isn &apos;t quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ushed , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the control policy of both bearings .
&quot; on one side is tr@@ ump , who wants to stim@@ ulate the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics keep it before , so the budget deficit would only be bigger . &quot;
&quot; Clinton who wants to demand more taxes on the other hand , that they will pay more taxes , and their critics say , &quot; more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; each wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is one of women who flee alone , almost daily life . &quot;
&quot; if arriving in Germany , they are often trau@@ mat@@ ised . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most a year old . &quot;
one has laid her little son in the arm .
he gu@@ esses with great eyes curious in the space .
his mother is fixing on the table .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Katrin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social relief offers in Bavaria , and deals with the topic women on the escape . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich &apos;s Aid . &quot;
it has been officially opened .
there are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no - but not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated : every woman who comes here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persecuted because they send torture or death or because their families send them as an hope in Europe , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; in women there were no other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal themselves secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experienced experience with sexual violence , forced , hon@@ our@@ able , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
&quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , the tugs demand a sexual action for example , is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who think that the end , once they arrived in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; even here , women in refugee are often regarded as minim@@ ally considered and worst is ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 per cent of women who live in the Munich area , are traum@@ ati@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not entirely voluntary . &quot;
many women were so used to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about life , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; since they often do not help to help themselves , it simply need more accommodations for them , calls B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they w@@ ishing from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some say with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ p@@ fal@@ z and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is something in accomod@@ ations of the governments . &quot;
&quot; in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , the press review of the government . &quot;
&quot; in some cases , in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , accommodation and medium @-@ sized houses , there are only two floors or their own houses for single @-@ standing women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men separately .
&quot; in a study published by the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated from separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy or men are accommod@@ ated together , men and women can be accommod@@ ated - violence against women are coming . &quot;
&quot; especially the shower room should be separated , and be easily accessible to women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this protection needs , you can read the And@@ al@@ abl@@ esen , which there is in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we talked about that there is us , we have a long qu@@ eue , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could make a second house easily .
assistance of Assi@@ stance : recei@@ v@@ ables according to new labour measures
representatives of the assist@@ ants have called on to set new labour measures in their disp@@ utes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded its total council starting from the beginning of September more working class struggle .
&quot; the J@@ DC told , that it had been appointed Minister to worry about the concerns about the contract . &quot;
&quot; in July , assist@@ ants and medical students have agreed to agree with the re@@ jection of a contract that has been agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was released on Twitter on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; &quot; har@@ r@@ ably calm &quot; would be too much problems , which led to the contract . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; considering the J@@ DC Executive Board , the J@@ DC member has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and concerns the official new negotiations for all manner . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board proposes a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a running program of escal@@ ating action which begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; to disp@@ utes the disp@@ utes that assist@@ ants took six times of six times , the first total fail@@ ures in the history of N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , following the election to re@@ jection of the agreed contract of contra@@ ctual conditions that were recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he divided BM@@ A members during the sessions , who took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jeremy Hunt said that the contract would be implemented for doctors in England . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of foreign side &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended up a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up his hands and an official end of the eight months of war in the words of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but as Vladimir Putin , his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es takes place in the reception , I cannot toler@@ ate this reconciliation in most reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was no charge , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile was very narrow , and he hardly scre@@ wed heat , even for his rest@@ rained conditions . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan said , &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before crisis , but even better . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as it would never happen . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable ch@@ asing showed that the Russian leader of Russia had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his execution : the surplus of a Russian fighter planes sent to the Syrian border by Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ ing .
Putin shared Ankara and accused Ankara to be back in the back .
&quot; it was even bigger , as it was celebrated by a thought @-@ out friend . &quot;
Vet@@ r@@ auen is going to build up again if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , nation@@ ally controlled media led a he@@ fty , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; once again , it seemed to be the Turks to blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; most serious , the alleg@@ ations of leading officers , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting was held only because Putin received the exc@@ use of the President Erdo@@ gan who wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could make a sort of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of an ar@@ mist@@ ice are clear . &quot;
&quot; Erdo@@ gan is the first line of all friends that he can get , after the last month after a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
he repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they are located on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean Sea .
this week the state television projected fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again .
&quot; in this way , a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it like this : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here for long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is fur@@ ious on the west , since its reaction to the attempted power of power was considered a weak answer . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the persist@@ ing Gro@@ ll come across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke it is to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , Russian Chief of State won a bonus for ensuring that he urged the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat to the elected State of State . &quot;
&quot; that is , for Moscow , a self @-@ understand@@ able , that even a profound fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this glorious palace , made by Russia and Turkey , one of how it once described an analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of foreign side &quot; represented : two countries who have contra@@ cted from the West and are badly treated . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria where Moscow has recently joined the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey can support each other . &quot;
&quot; it might be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of first call on the press conference , both pre@@ sidents were held on the press conference , that they didn &apos;t even stri@@ ped the theme . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey missed it on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize this . &quot;
&quot; there is no unique con@@ sensus about it , where a common denomin@@ ator can be found in Syria . &quot;
&quot; but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , as NATO member Turkey enjoyed the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better to talk about two leaders at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s Executive Board , the R@@ BS brand is supposed to be reduced to a back@@ office roll . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
&quot; in Scotland , Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan divided Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions . &quot;
&quot; since then , the Bank has been dist@@ anced and saved almost c@@ oll@@ ed before eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand @-@ wing &quot; R@@ BS &quot; brand have been used to protect other end consumer financial stamps . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds on sponsor@@ ing , from Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray . &quot;
but now she decided to focus more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alized head office and stock markets change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are others to get smaller brands for private clients that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was interviewed during a visiting tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he distributed the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investment brand , as well as the brand , under which our employees will be busy as we are now more to a Bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now , I say there is no global goals , but pursue local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different , and our employees will work with the customers . &quot;
R@@ BS has already told that it will not be able to continue his Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing to increase the perception of various brands in his sports sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop the bank of brands , as do we concentrate on inside ( we asked ) to make it a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Executive Officer . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , if we said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched this brand . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these brands again , therefore , I think that time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches his 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spray champagne after a double in new@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th profit &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he set at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win the night a milestone . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey which reaches milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ char@@ ds , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ channel winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won at G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is also here
&quot; I am very happy about that it happened at New@@ market , because I am here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; there is no big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers to win the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ys achieved the milestone in the obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson , and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the ninth D@@ erb@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 Car@@ ri@@ er@@ es@@ ie@@ ge &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of Modern and it &apos;s no surprise that he achieved this milestone in just a few years ago .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct , which differs from the other in weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enthusiastic fans for years now for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I told Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ s@@ om that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 win@@ nings , if he would not only be a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already almost 30 years of winning players that &apos;s great .
&quot; he has a lively personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition , it is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the suspension of the brit@@ ish flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was annoying .
&quot; a whole series of big tur@@ ni@@ sts , including his famous &quot; glorious seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived an aircraft crash , and received a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he initially had trouble when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to def@@ y its branches and return to its shape . &quot;
and he &apos;s still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to keep on stage for competitions up to his least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russian President Putin mo@@ ist Chief of Staff Sergei IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V
the Russian President Vladimir Putin acquired his Chief of Staff Sergei IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a lot of years part of the closest confidenti@@ ality of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; in a review of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin said without indication of reasons &quot; the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s arranged by his duties as chairman of the Russian President &apos;s government . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was the representative of Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was appointed as his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the site of Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is called ( in Russian ) that he was later to be res@@ ett@@ led by the head of the head of the government . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin , &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity in terms of law , and controls , to implement your instructions . &quot;
&quot; Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday , that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has asked to leave his position and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor . &quot;
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has mysteri@@ ously made Moscow .
Serge@@ y IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a long time one of the closest colleagues of Vladimir Putin and works like he for Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin that was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff returns to his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the l@@ ord@@ ship for cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is this a consequence of a kind of power battle ?
nobody knows that .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion is that a man who was elected as a potential president , was to lead to Russian environmental policy - pushed into big scep@@ tic@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , which are quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V said it is true that I asked for you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation with me this very complicated position - you could almost say - compl@@ ained about four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turned out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
&quot; IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V increased the post in December , 2011 . &quot;
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin became a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the federal service ( FS@@ B ) , who was appointed the K@@ GB , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V as one of five people to whom he trusted in most . &quot;
&quot; once , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was assumed that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V could be President of Russia for Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of Putin would have failed against the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , seam@@ less ally Putin &apos;s allies , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;

Queens@@ ANT Crossing : bridge connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of Queens@@ bury Cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four envel@@ opes from the &quot; op@@ blo@@ wers , &quot; which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
&quot; it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 cord pieces . &quot;
&quot; the project will be completed by May 1 , 2017 , to be completed by May 2017 . &quot;
&quot; at the construction site , Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and one of the first to come from the country to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment at the construction of Queens@@ bury Cros@@ sings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of a engineers with a truly epic measure of more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the sh@@ utter is set between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; a total of almost 79 % of all bri@@ de@@ cks at their place and the last section of the deck is getting a bet@@ ong@@ ings for the deck today , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; at this fantastic project , the cl@@ asp provides future @-@ proof high and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last road cover and its connection with the most located North @-@ deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by pulling the northern slopes of 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very sacred work .
&quot; the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct 222 meters long , because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons , and had to be moved up to a slope of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; the toler@@ ances , as the toler@@ ances , on which the team work , tiny - on each side , they were only some milli@@ metres . &quot;
luck@@ ily everything went very well .

the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck the event on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty swim in safety , while their boat moving from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat was turned around , and presented us the worst , &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already kicked off the boat apart from its range until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man had exhausted all ages of 60 , and was found in a boat without life jacket . &quot;
they were all aboard the coastal ret@@ inal boots and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water were lucky and be alive and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it dissolved itself during the boat of the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat . &quot;
someone has awak@@ ened today about these men .

this al@@ ar@@ ming became his sister .
&quot; together with their lives , the 45 year old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but you could not move it to leave the apartment .
&quot; therefore she went with her life , from the house . &quot;
&quot; on the street , they met the ex @-@ life of the man . &quot;

who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green Finance : investors should be stronger in future opportunities in future .
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; acting concept &quot; for the next rating of advice .
but strife is programmed .
the first line is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing .
&quot; Christoph Brat@@ mann , President of the SPD : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build urban areas in future 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; the favourable apartments , however , can also arise . &quot;
&quot; however , the large part of the town hall was , however , Brat@@ mann : &quot; how are you going to build up private areas with investors ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 per cent , but as possible as 20 per cent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
a new urban construction program that will cost millions of costs and will be financed even for inc@@ enti@@ ves .
the problem so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions .
the CDU wants to keep investors as low as possible .
the left will still want hardness for investors .
&quot; regardless of what , Brat@@ mann , ba@@ the on a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; the concept concept is implemented , which will ensure additional tasks in the building management . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program isn &apos;t yet completely : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments that should be built anyway .
&quot; but how does one compare the loss of another 1,@@ 300 favorable flats , which will exp@@ ire in the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , the planned spokesperson on Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the town . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would have to be thought to bring apartments back into the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western town .
upon a blow the problem could solve .
&quot; because in the west city , there is the end of the year . &quot;
around 1800 apartments you could get back into the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners to do housing companies .
&quot; because the number of social housing in the western city has been dra@@ stically increased , it is removed from the target of the so @-@ called mixture . &quot;
a concentration of social guards in only a few neighbour@@ hoods shall no longer give .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in discussion .
&quot; said S &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; for a vast majority , the CDU out of the boat must be carried out into the boat . &quot;
I have focused on more buildings for family homes .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting trip to health and happiness , worth it &quot;
it is fascinating as the world changed .
&quot; teen@@ ager and child are no longer going out to play outside , but rather , they prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , to star@@ red on screens , was executed in the last decade of many . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about to get people from the sofa and become more active .
&quot; at the beginning , the screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are not close to each other . &quot;
&quot; of course , I am taking off of course on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , a app that were created on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later it emerged from a drawing series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest before the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
&quot; within less days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go has more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go outside and looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons to be followed by a GPS , once they were found once , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the wreck , and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , the game led to a considerable increase in steps which returns the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ di@@ je , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35.000 users , distributed the Washington Post recently with that , within two days of the game market , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent each day . &quot;
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance campaigns for health , people want to bring to &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; to get &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; every day to be active &quot; &quot; to be boring , because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look like . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces its chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages which is too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; therefore , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air , sunshine and sunshine . &quot;
some people close the hunt even new friends .
&quot; as always there is wor@@ l@@ ump@@ tuous games , which must always be compl@@ ained about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has a breakthrough happened .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit earlier our activity , they gave us no reason to exagger@@ ate sport as it does this game . &quot;
&quot; the new will lose his appeal , and the use will be followed by time . &quot;
&quot; but because of Pok@@ em@@ ons success , however , more games will be able to join the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world . many people will help hunting , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all this immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
full line brilliant .
and now the Olympi@@ ad winner .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ cl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ battle ship and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
&quot; their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; - Mann@@ er@@ sk@@ amer@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the pig bars during the solo concert during the solo concert at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who wins a Multi@@ campaign and overall the fifth , while they consoli@@ date their reputation , the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; she broke out in tears , when her final result was shown and her long journey was at the end . &quot;
&quot; this success puts it in the same league as unique athletes as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; the last three years has dominated its sports class , 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , that &apos;s a mixture of amb@@ ition and precision , that she said &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ist in 1984 that I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was expecting a final inspection in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athl@@ ete , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not to return with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace the gold and silver in the solo concert of women at the Summer Olympics in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she was retired in his retirement party by Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi for his retirement party . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on the top of their long departure , never the future is planned , that &apos;s not really true . &quot;
part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ bling pass - is based on Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip to the gym@@ nast@@ ics , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has no longer lost any competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will stop as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; when Must@@ af@@ ina led easily through two rot@@ ations , the image touched . &quot;
pig P@@ ics and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es won the World Championship title - l@@ ur@@ king .
&quot; it recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig , and put it on the floor with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when she expected her du@@ ck - a pure form@@ ality , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in their collection book , was reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal at a Tie@@ af@@ ina went on . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old Mann@@ i chapel , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their soil exercise , she threw the audience to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes doub@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; as it concerns , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old T@@ we@@ et has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in a car with music in the car
&quot; according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade during the first series of orders of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators fired eight shots from a hand@@ fire@@ weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police declared that the triple murder had not been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the att@@ ack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were in possession of an adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the polic@@ eman from Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ators managed to get a close look at , whether they are connected to four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , seven attacks were killed and two more injured in h@@ isp@@ anic residential areas within four months . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area before a house , &quot; divided Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they have been linked to the conclusion that the attacks are linked , and the same mur@@ der@@ ers were committed . &quot;
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site . &quot;
&quot; a witness shared the police with , that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music . &quot;
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was targeted at an empty pick@@ up truck to half an hour before the triple murder , and was assumed that it was the work of the standard mur@@ derer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a cephal@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and naturally his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his aging has Edmund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know anything during their pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought , I create this . &quot;
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let me go .
&quot; whatever is not true -- of course one has left itself , &quot; she said . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her was informed that Edmund is never able to recognize them under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institutional him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Edmund can run with help of help .
Edmund was neither to sit nor cro@@ oked up to his third year and he can still not speak .
but he makes progress slowly .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing of the drawing by Edmund for &quot; Please sing myself a thing before . &quot;
&quot; we bring to him a drawing language , &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not typical drawing language -- tells her . Edmund has invented some characters alone .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic , as with Edmund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or c@@ ic@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy . &quot;
symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it is influenced by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus In@@ infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t really know .
&quot; I did not ask for a long time after the forecast , because I didn &apos;t expect to tell me someone can really say . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it will get better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

why do we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I present in the tower in the gym@@ nast@@ ics of gym@@ nast@@ ics and for more than one reason .
firstly I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
&quot; and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ner@@ ves , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , who is Cath@@ o@@ lic@@ in , is proud of everyone . &quot;
this team is finally reflected the US .
it has been fixed the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female Tur@@ ner@@ ves was a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was che@@ ered a surprising Olympics win@@ ner@@ gies and America .
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they unexpected , yet master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ik@@ rout@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone won the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold for women at an individual event . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but we do not see gy@@ ms classes throughout the country . &quot;
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to get it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; last Five , &quot; because the next matches will only have four turbul@@ ences in the team . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like that gym@@ nast@@ ics are a more expensive sport and Turner will join the first line in private gym@@ nast@@ ics that are maintained by parents , who will rise from parents , competitiveness and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these verses , the Turner will receive their overall training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer by Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since she started with the tower . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired by the congregations of Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie . &quot;
I founded my gy@@ ms Foundation of 20 years .
&quot; in my events we have free and affordable gym@@ nast@@ ics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and Hisp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gym@@ nast@@ ics offering the opportunity to learn from this amazing Olympic sports . &quot;
&quot; it develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and identification for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to be interested in gym@@ nast@@ ics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such exciting time .
&quot; thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you for getting so many young girls with different background to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant doctors want to organize more strikes after they refused to have Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal

&quot; Jeremy Hunt must now act , raising the up@@ lifting and concerns the concerns of assist@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do this , they have made it clear to the assistance of assistance , that they are ready to perform further labour measures . &quot;
&quot; the final strike at the end of April saw an increase of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , since nur@@ ses and doctors have been involved in order to grant physicians on the stri@@ k@@ mail cover . &quot;
the ministers had been hoping to termin@@ ate the dispute over changes due to the adoption of the re@@ formed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A would like to receive a better week@@ day reference for the 5@@ 4.000 assistance , which will be subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ mon , Director General of the N@@ HS , called for assistance to the strike . &quot;
&quot; mor@@ nings said : &quot; labour measures do not reach any little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare for patients , nur@@ ses and their families only wor@@ ries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the past two months , we talked to the Com@@ intern of Assi@@ stance and with the Ministry of Health as well as other minist@@ ries positively to concerns the concerns and of the w@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; employers hop@@ ed that this continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as de@@ comp@@ elling , flexibility in training , additional training for those who were from a vocational training period , training courses , mutual recognition of course , training courses , mutual respect to compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;

culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness makes election campaign in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness has led to that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim congregations will be ignored like a devastating report of government today .
&quot; the former cabinet committee Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town houses to have evidence of electoral abuse regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Commun@@ ion Government , who is now an anti @-@ corrupt moti@@ ves , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of voters of religious moti@@ ves would be so bad that it should be allowed to set off the police outside of elec@@ tors to protect voters outside the elec@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should have a reference to themselves , to prove their identity in the elections . &quot;
&quot; at present , a elec@@ torate has to name only its name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , un@@ removable ink on the finger of a person if they leave their elec@@ tive agree to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer should get more protection says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official calculations or work groups .
&quot; this is not only for election fraud , but should also protect the municipal government before the wider corruption and financial control culture that goes on , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Do@@ wning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special constitu@@ ent tribunal decided that the mayor &apos;s mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be found on corrupt and illegal practices of his Am@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; on cy@@ n@@ ical way , and that he had brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; the Rah@@ man shall have led his campaign on the basis , that it is the cor@@ related duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of a re@@ im@@ itation , where one person cho@@ oses one another . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there were evidence for fraud throughout the whole country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed itself al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter - where older members of the Muslim community have made pressure on people to choose one candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the Leadership to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report , it says : &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on the needy members of some ethnic min@@ orities was exercised , in particular women and young people to vote in accordance with the Will@@ ful of the El@@ der , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ical or banana background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions have ignored such a behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; beliefs concerning eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric said to have 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists are to stop &quot; election &quot; to stop &quot; election . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , is also demanding the tou@@ g@@ her registration tests to prevent the electoral directory on immigration and social security purposes . &quot;
&quot; consider , consider elec@@ torate before choosing your ID . &quot;
&quot; do not use distant ink on the finger of a person , once they have given their voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are in@@ correct .
a three @-@ year limitation on orders to an automatic letter .
prohibition that political activists work complete letter and envel@@ opes .
the police give the powers to set up bul@@ locks around election stations .
&quot; an amendment to Re@@ ti@@ fy the In@@ dict@@ ment of the People Act 1983 , Act of the People &apos;s Repres@@ entation in 1983 , is reli@@ eved of an amendment to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 . &quot;
photographer ban on election stations .
requirements that only English may be used in the election stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
&quot; Inten@@ si@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees take place the rule , that voters go alone to the election cabin . &quot;
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; ast@@ oun@@ ding &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no punishment was put on .
&quot; the election court has l@@ ut@@ ted in Rah@@ man and his deputy , because of a lit@@ igation against corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons for sufficient - due to the high demands on the criminal procedure - pleaded not guilty . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the pot@@ ent &quot; ab@@ duct control &quot; of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the verdict in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents a proud heir , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and covered spread of electoral fraud and void of some authorities thre@@ aten them good reputation . &quot;

&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is far not the only one to have gold fighting athl@@ ete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if you must give the social media faith . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Rio Olympics in Rio and all the famous faces , created at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olymp@@ ion@@ es@@ ques , which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Holl@@ y@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; the Hunter and the wolf : member of the US team in the Bogen@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates Double @-@ der on the bike race , many people showed on the internet as a certain she@@ et@@ cher of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after pictures , on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the arch@@ ers got the mad@@ ness in the social media and gave to that he has already been able to hear how Leo looks like this . &quot;
&quot; I see no big simil@@ arity , with the exception of the face hair@@ y , &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post with . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so don &apos;t leave it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly occur more into the centre : the re@@ aring simil@@ arity between the British trans@@ atl@@ antic Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
&quot; the Russian gym@@ na@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her large , expres@@ sive eyes shall be passed as a double singer for the Cuban American singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African S@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison . &quot;
a gear higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and Ac@@ tor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nice who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun@@ ni@@ fied skin and bl@@ ond hair like the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian von Fans was attacked , an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot;
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy that others also liked the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
&quot; theory in the room : according to this user , there is perhaps one reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope solo and the Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter is an incredibly similar facial form and eyes . &quot;

&quot; to declare one , Byron &apos;s comments on the performance of the swi@@ mmer , and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , they were in@@ adequate and an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation . Byron does that which he has said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald was arrested in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that she was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment at the moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swi@@ vel chair in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I was looking forward to the performance of the swi@@ mmer , and not related to them as a person . &quot;

&quot; she said , &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales surface , they took a pair of under@@ wear from the position , moved their own str@@ uts and tro@@ users and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not have to find a little dis@@ crete location to do it - it was just there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; she repeated the same with three further under@@ taking before she finally decided that you did nothing , and went out again . &quot;
&quot; it didn &apos;t seem to mind that someone watched - or about the person who would buy the under@@ pants , which had tried them . &quot;
&quot; David Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how conflic@@ ting someone would take care of a person who had a different person and had not been washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I have received , the staff tried to draw the clothes from the sale , after she went - what is good as good . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before weapons of arms
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him a little safer . &quot;
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to walk with armed men on distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how you turn the sk@@ e@@ wer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; when you ann@@ ul@@ ses you from behind , you should turn to the first , so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and go out from the gun line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
seize the weapon then between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then strike him with the knees and twist it , while the att@@ ack@@ ers hit pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him into the face and move backward while they set the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; when att@@ ack@@ ers come from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the gun line , grab the weapon and rotate them , so the att@@ ack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , lay the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its handle before moving back@@ wards and set the weapon on him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it is Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi Vor@@ ster .

travel Ian Wright sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide to his tongue at the dirty locations of Europe
a British traveler with@@ drew his immune system and lam@@ in@@ ef@@ lex of a serious testing - he re@@ lu@@ red some of the dirty and most frequent places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k scra@@ pped his course on a Euro @-@ scra@@ per , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a washing kno@@ b of an access toilet and a public telephone in Russia to make the resistance of his immune system under proof . &quot;
&quot; in front of every object , he used a lumin@@ ance to show and show us what he will be attached . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the washing @-@ kno@@ b of a draw@@ backs , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely imper@@ vious , but in fact they are in a kitchen sul@@ try more poor bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of Dar@@ mb@@ ac@@ ia and about his own health . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily , nothing left what he refused , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine , as he travelled through the world and ate great things and wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations , up to washing buttons from toilets , the task posed his immune system definitely under a sample . &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ worried what my health concern and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and slaughter . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was righteous in his call . &quot;
the only thing he refused to be a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his pro@@ filing was showing a lumin@@ ometer of more than 4000 units .
&quot; in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ ometric hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse , after their L@@ umin@@ ometric dose was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have a little less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacter@@ i@@ als in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This is the worst thing I have smoked in a toilet , close . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I &apos;m going to do nothing here because it is dr@@ ill@@ ful here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers really something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating and also explains the advantages of Pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended with that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
do you claim that interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to ask them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumption of more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film &apos;s direction , added : &quot; let me say , &quot; &quot; I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had made some of the things that I have reli@@ ed on him , like the ec@@ lec@@ tic Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things that it was easier to bring Ian to bring them and others , where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m happy that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in one of the vali@@ d@@ validation survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of respondents agreed to include l@@ actic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent , that they contain at least occasionally products used to contain mit@@ actic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destro@@ ys Del@@ og@@ ging social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ cial family left her social apartment after a delay of £ 50,000 because they had terr@@ orized their neighbours . &quot;
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints about their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash . Corn@@ wall was thrown .
&quot; after being displaced from their property , sho@@ cked employees of the housing estate found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls are rounded holes , wooden screws were sha@@ ved , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot;
the family moved to res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed to now live in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she fears not to repair the apartment . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , as this property is believed to be considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their call is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror , which had added the family , had a street fighting with bas@@ eball , drug abuse , drug abuse and excessive scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; skel@@ eton , 47 , whose name stood on the lease agreement , got an arrangement for ant@@ iso@@ dic behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be demolished under circumstances , an old mill was found . &quot;
&quot; were tra@@ ded in the estate in which the past drugs were tra@@ ded , wooden pil@@ es were &quot;
neighbours told they watched them on the street and when the police had to be called on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ etes it and her partner for@@ ged this week violent from the property since they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntarily .
Del@@ og@@ ging were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They stri@@ pped to anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not lived here !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , which was called by the police in regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
&quot; on the infl@@ ated side of the community , garbage and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it is the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and the family , as a dol@@ og@@ ation is always the final step in the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; that was a very difficult case , as the behavior was extremely difficult , and their deeds had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall and members of the church who have gone cour@@ ageous to us and have made us the information we have done . &quot;
I hope that this development will don@@ ate some neighbours of comfort and con@@ veys the message that ant@@ iso@@ cial behaviour will not be toler@@ ated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they all were over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a dirty mattress , used in one of the bedrooms of the house based on the dol@@ phins live on the ground &quot;
workers of the house @-@ administration are now going to we@@ dge land@@ mines that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police introduced a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ hi@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
skel@@ eton received a fine fine after having found guilty of a drug in the class B class B .
&quot; she claimed that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came in 2013 at a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner will now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth . &quot;
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ led with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; the police says that she is going to be rent@@ al@@ ing , who do not hold himself to the property order &quot;
&quot; Angela Cro@@ w from the Devon and Corn@@ wall were shared with , that the Del@@ phic is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not hold on the assignment . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those who have been damaged by such a behavior . &quot;
&quot; the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and ant@@ iso@@ cial behaviour that continue to work with partners , to protect our congregations . &quot;

&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ icals Christians who asked support in important states such as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; wrong reports concerning his can@@ did@@ acy , he took his well @-@ known media . &quot;
republi@@ can highly bur@@ gh@@ ing
Utah is usually a safe bank for Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or from the US in June , Tr@@ ump and his rival to the Democrats , Hillary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that are common for republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia also apply as endangered .
&quot; in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question how he wants to stop at Clin@@ ics : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether back : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he do nothing else to tell us as &quot; the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich in order for him at the end of reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump continued . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Party of Tr@@ ump should be threatened to submit funds to support his electoral campaign , it should not be able to present any better conversion values . &quot;
&quot; instead , with the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans for Congress becoming stronger among the arms . &quot;

&quot; with this , a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; a musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ einer masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled himself with the role of Maria a youth room .
&quot; in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted by the Venezuel@@ on@@ ese conductor Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot; &quot;
we always say that it is characterised by Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and mel@@ ody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ einer music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she reminds of her loving kindness with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
first because it is exceptional !
and then Mari@@ as &apos;s personality is there .
&quot; she tells her in her song : &quot; I Fe@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I Fe@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so it is wise , of course also na@@ ive , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character that I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honor to work with you .
it is an enormous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a need for him .
&quot; one sees it in any of his movements , in his ga@@ it , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up to date : &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ at@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; today we did the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants wanted it not . &quot;
&quot; these are the same topics , and they are equally powerful today as then . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;

Turkey : Kurdish municipality counts with mass curse
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the p@@ end of the G@@ ülen @-@ Middle Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short term , the Kurdish congregation of Germany is scheduled for short term with tens of thousands of protection looking from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , there could even be &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard work of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish congregation of Germany anticip@@ ates a mass curse to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany when the Erdo@@ gan regime fought the min@@ orities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; because the government had passed Kurdish hon@@ ors with criminal inter@@ actions before months , 500,000 Kurds are moving out within Turkey . &quot;
&quot; following the blin@@ ded p@@ utsch , the sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will start to start in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state , who took up refugees in own country , said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Chief of Staff accused the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in Algeri@@ an cities . &quot;
&quot; in order to raise Erdo@@ gan to the remaining Kurds , Erdo@@ gan is increasing . &quot;
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were exter@@ minated in the past hundred years or exp@@ elled , &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who also became the CDU member . &quot;
&quot; the government of exile demanded that the German government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan , and his followers . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , there is also a &quot; wit@@ ch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of G@@ ülen movement fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , mainly Kurds and opposition . &quot;
the fire marking as G@@ ülen supporters , teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics are the professional existence . &quot;
&quot; he who does not fit and engaged by Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and sec@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the G@@ ülen @-@ Middle Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports on the figures of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks had already reported the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; at the reporting date June 30 , this was estimated to be 11.@@ 386 people , and thus nearly 29 per cent of all who have been entitled ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , they do not move to war , poverty or irrit@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively politically , so from the state of government , individually followed . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it is we@@ aving &quot;
&quot; Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives do not receive anything from the summer campaign , and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood them .
&quot; in 2021 , the country code will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the German Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; than so far , it does not go : summer holidays , heat and farming battle - it bit@@ es itself . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ als , who are to be convinced by the election struggle , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most holi@@ day@@ makers , who are on the country , on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are no loc@@ als , so may not choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; these are practical problems : in the holidays there are hel@@ pers , the posters hang up , fl@@ yers and distribute posters , fl@@ yers and out into the end of the votes cast out . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to turn out just under the people out of elections . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , when one can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition must be afraid of his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clear behind the CDU . &quot;
&quot; exciting is exciting , as strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the cargo . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age and since 2008 , head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign , one sees from his big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , spread ro@@ ses and chat a little with the people , as it was already his legendary , Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has gotten cold feet and is Chancellor Merkel reli@@ eves the blame on the flour@@ ishing of Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , you &quot; We create &quot; &quot; accelerated the rise of sp@@ op@@ u@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CDU with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place . &quot;
she has been invited twice in German Chancellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel general meeting is in the North East .
&quot; but the target group did not plan , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mec@@ kl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
the nor@@ theastern CDU largely ren@@ ounces the usual campaign conditions on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; that , so , co@@ ca@@ des , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that in the country the basis is crum@@ bled , that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the depths of the country barely exist@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; however , the Council of the CDU campaign co@@ ca@@ des to his fellow soldier is also sel@@ ent@@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; you have to go where it is we@@ aving , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot is on the game , Sell@@ ering has called for a particularly dedicated election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in p@@ olls , S &amp; Ds recently ended up with 22 percent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and only barely in front of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD still had a clear of 3@@ 5.6 percent in front of the CDU ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in p@@ olls , will be able to make the leap into the Land@@ tag . &quot;
they make a modern virtu@@ e of the holiday in need of a modern Tu@@ b and lay down their campaigns on the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; it calls the President Claudia Müller . &quot;
otherwise green electoral fighters go to local stim@@ ets among the tourists .
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top can@@ did@@ acy , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a penalty .
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from blocking
&quot; in speed , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to compl@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; for the persons responsible for the construction of the construction , starting at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and ending only at 20 o &apos;clock , there is no praise . &quot;
&quot; all in all , &quot; El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet gas station is told . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no train too .
&quot; at the end of October , the construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south as scheduled until the end of October . &quot;
&quot; the dispos@@ ition of those responsible for the construction work is praised , about when it comes to the establishment of Beh@@ el &apos;s cru@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the lock of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the traffic situation is relaxed within the place . &quot;
citizens now can drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the so@@ fter travel through the place seems to return .
&quot; there were partially significant dis@@ comfort , &quot; says the deputy management of the refurb@@ ishment , the deputy chief leader Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the natives of Bach@@ ar Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many blocks sought and rather trusted as the signs . &quot;
so what led to some other trucks in residential areas .
&quot; since the speed limit has not been observed , the municipality demanded the measuring car of M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable excess , &quot; says King , who made himself able to know about the location . &quot;
there have been two to three per minute .
the fastest one was on the way with 77 km / hour in the speed @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has gone on , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open to the road again . &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 re@@ development has led them to revenues , everyone who asks you can see . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected are affected . &quot;
&quot; for those who have to do with the &quot; end &quot; less to do , so for other companies , the rehabilitation has hardly consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the deal@@ ership in Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; maximum slight fall , &quot; but also dreamed that of course &quot; the lear@@ ners are missing . &quot;
&quot; on the strongest , the local are along the road . &quot;
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öhn@@ er , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds distinct words . &quot;
that is already exist@@ ent .
not only him but all the restaurants I met &quot; hard . &quot;
&quot; customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we need to be happy about every Euro .
the sales revenues are based on &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
Street started his operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
he had to release half of his staff .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , the policy would have been re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to an inquiry by G@@ öhn@@ er if there might be a financial compensation , otherwise it might benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now they also have the dis@@ advantages that result in the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
G@@ öhn@@ er knows from other coun@@ ties where something generous has been developed .
&quot; in all complaints , G@@ öhn@@ er is sure that his inn will continue . &quot;
&quot; finally , the family @-@ run business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars are , due to the complicated transport of traffic less frequently , can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t get started , it is also very different . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the restoration work , G@@ öhn@@ er has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öhn@@ er keeps the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clients for the biggest crisis that has experienced its hospitality in their long @-@ standing history . &quot;
six months construction work is already brutal .
it is constantly rob@@ bed in the name of the terror in laws .
&quot; according to recent attacks , the Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a Dul@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partners say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
&quot; all its proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partners , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Justice at the presentation of his new security . &quot;
they &apos;re asking anyone .
&quot; other , more advanced points would be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I am also concerned about it too .
&quot; as the Minister of Interior , however , was located on results and on a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; according to the latest proposals in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gave a little time before he presented his conclusions for the security in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; but the more extensive , however , the more extensive . &quot;
&quot; a lot is already announced , announced that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ ck @-@ encrypted communication , is not new . &quot;
the fact that Germany does not have to implement multiple EU requirements for passenger data and weapons .
the call to more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; as part of the year , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second stop for proposals that have not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to set sympath@@ iz@@ ations for terrorist groups , with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult for the SPD , &quot; the CDU man is dre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he can still keep this for reasonable and demanding nothing , what does not have a chance at the coalition partner . &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also .
&quot; these are partly in itself : he plans fast @-@ to @-@ release procedures , and more possibilities for the detention of people before the deportation . &quot;
&quot; refugees , who are brought to the country , should have pre @-@ check their smartphones and expos@@ e social media accounts for a security check test before . &quot;
&quot; at Dul@@ ations for ab@@ orted asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than ever - such as such , the off@@ ender or dis@@ card their papers to wear their identity . &quot;
some of them is politically and legal .
it also works in@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the ine@@ quality of thought of thought for example - the question arises : what does it mean to do with security and terror ?
&quot; yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère says it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be noted that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people were worried about the high refugee numbers . &quot;
&quot; and things that are deeply engaged in people , did not let themselves out in election campaign times . &quot;
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
&quot; the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the prevention is great .
&quot; and yes , they are fighting competitions . &quot;
&quot; in the case of internal security , the Union and the SPD are increasingly active in position . &quot;
in the past few days it went high between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ ris@@ er contro@@ versy over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a saf@@ est policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , where the Ress@@ orts also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and demand a return from the double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also proud to reconc@@ ile the sounds here .
&quot; from a return from the double pass , he has nothing . &quot;
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
&quot; re@@ locate , be not useful . &quot;
and at a Bur@@ ka ban he had constitutional law .
&quot; whether its own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners , and if it actually is &quot; reasonable &quot; is only to show the co@@ al@@ ition@@ ist partner . &quot;
there is some things that could provide for war .
but the SPD is also trying to pro@@ claim in internal security at the topic of inner safety .
&quot; however , the party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel is first sign@@ aling and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes further to further increase the security . &quot;
Volkswagen joins us yet .
&quot; despite diesel operations , the supplier numbers have to rise worldwide . &quot;
but it is not running in all markets .
&quot; in the re@@ jection reaction , there are confusion about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car park can continue to provide further increase in terms of diesel thanks to its many brands and many well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the core brand VW is weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe , and thus loaded the total sale as that recorded in the Da@@ x not@@ ated company . &quot;
&quot; in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , the brand sold more than 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries of deliveries increased by almost a sixth . &quot;
&quot; Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , head of company Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , led the weak@@ est numbers from July , mainly on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , it has been given a buying back in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , British vote suffered from the EU too , explained a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , where the exhaust gas deposits first escal@@ ated , a Min@@ us also continues to be@@ ech . &quot;
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the affected area brand of Lower Saxony is coming closer and due to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extradition of 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles are added . &quot;
&quot; in January to July , Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales plan from January to July . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling for about 2.5 million cars to upgrade into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of re@@ armament , VW , that the conversion of cars did not have negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after upgra@@ ding the vehicles it will give fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor output . &quot;
&quot; the car park will guarantee the customer after the conversion of a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; warranty , &quot; as it was announced on Friday in the business circuits . &quot;
reason for legal host@@ esses .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee for ger@@ ated diesel models . &quot;
this last Monday VW @-@ representative were confirmed in the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been confirmed that there were this meeting .
VW has fulfilled the editions of my legal Commission and the KBA contract .
&quot; devi@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor performance after re@@ armament had no deteri@@ oration and any type of approved vehicle data . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was called in company circuits . &quot;
&quot; the term &quot; guarantee &quot; is the possibility that customers will come to a workshop for example , half a year after the upgrade to a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that it is possible to do any damage to any damage caused by the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ andal in any case of any warranty conditions as it was called . &quot;
therefore VW is not using the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund in the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands of rich austerity in the future as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; on Thursday , banker Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; it is only about 139 customers who par@@ ked 40 million euros on gre@@ ro@@ - or daily balance . &quot;
&quot; German banks , German banks speaks of a single fall , and doesn &apos;t see a signal : normal spar@@ er would not be afraid to pay for their savings . &quot;
&quot; banks money by night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they need to pay 0.4 per cent of the pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; this fee applies to Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund in September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on gre@@ ro@@ - or daily balance . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; he has been w@@ asted 40 million euros , that could be lifted from one day to the other , and that he could not dec@@ eive . &quot;
&quot; the bank boss lies at me on the central bank account , and account for 0.4 per cent , &quot; said the banker . &quot;
I can &apos;t go for every million 4000 Euros .
the cost he is based on the principle of the principle .
&quot; cash simply could be found in the T@@ res@@ res of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already seen four survivors , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other assets .
only few walking to other banks .
the cooperative association Bavaria stated : &quot; the extreme monetary policy of the ECB causes significant costs at all banks .
&quot; it is possible to wear alone , unless possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account leadership , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with criminal interest for deposits from three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 had been head@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief leader of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay for deposits , so the competition in Germany is much too strong for banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a banker said in the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is a cli@@ pper that is equipped with a wealth of wealth . &quot;
&quot; that can be a problem for a small bank , if they ski@@ pped free of charge . &quot;
&quot; the G@@ mund , founded in 1911 , has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ ats , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; famous actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; there are currently no other banks known to the cooperative association Bavaria , &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; at the end of June , the President of the German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank ( BvR ) , Uwe Frö@@ hlich , had explained in late June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negatives is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition is hard , and it dro@@ us the migration of investors to the competition . &quot;
customers in Germany will not fall in the width .
Dest@@ ination plates : who are actually buying records ?
lon@@ ely men love middle age .
&quot; before you come to comm@@ ent@@ ator , in order to su@@ stain him under the p@@ seudonym &quot; non @-@ alcoholic men of men with che@@ wing ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , records of records not to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the real@@ ms of physical objects , but due to mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently purchased a record are all fore@@ sight depending on the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely cas@@ ual group .
&quot; it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older platform runners retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) . &quot;
but are the results of You@@ go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera during the midst of a bust@@ ling road in So@@ ho , a modest gray suit and wild before I stand before I stand , my hands hold and something like this : &quot; &quot; so let &apos;s take a close look . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s throw a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart rate So@@ h@@ os slowly immig@@ rated to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once an independent seller have been based - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I from Sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle age ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data : eight men mean age , one woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops in order to fill the few hours . &quot;
is he a collector I wonder ?
&quot; I already guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets . &quot;
&quot; these records , above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records , which he could not afford when they had appeared and once more items which he sold when he was young and ple@@ xed . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things , when I was probably a little too young , to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it is true that those who buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and drink very much . &quot;
that is my L@@ aster .
&quot; We@@ z , 25 , who works with Sister Ray , believes that many customers that he meets , meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and get to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; of the conversations , which I led , people generally accepted as part of their collection by 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
that would explain the boom of the turn@@ out of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica , to recognize that record transactions offers a so@@ othing community of equality . &quot;
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world , and want to withdraw from trusted sound pitch , from objects which will be able to watch over youth experiences . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
that &apos;s like a collector so and I think it &apos;s so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; fl@@ ashes a staff from a flat stack .
&quot; a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who have purchased a record last month , they haven &apos;t heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a turn@@ tables that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; at this time of news report , I would probably look very concerned while passing through a stack to Bos@@ sa Nova Kom@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three men of middle age ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone first came here and said : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables , but I would like to buy a radio record , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a great percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musi@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; the younger people , not older , who first cle@@ ave the first . &quot;
&quot; stop@@ over , dedicated to the record panels almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , te@@ ens and women middle age . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above stores - Wild Be@@ asts of latest syn@@ thes@@ ia and sex@@ ist pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ills from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity in the customer . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks particularly lon@@ ely , but nail psychological trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ectable , when one stands for about 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; El@@ an@@ ora , 27 , runs for some minutes in the shop and considered the variations of the panels for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a window man@@ ne@@ ak as a wholesale buy .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore the collecting records are not real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or in other way but the beauty of the plates is ... it drives with a de@@ arest sigh@@ s .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; as I admit that the je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ pants , I observe a group of young girls who group for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Cro@@ sley Record Players . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees her - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to deal with them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering the fact that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send in the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is the one that gives most for luxurious items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my resear@@ ches revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave at least in record shops in So@@ ho , the large number of female collectors and record lovers exist in reality , record shops and in On@@ line@@ for@@ ts . &quot;
these people are working hard in school or offices .
&quot; they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with safety by record transactions of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through the sheets , while they avoid the rigid view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 year old false moder@@ ator , who rises above the shoulders of a middle age . &quot;

French court re@@ jects offer about demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , living in the thousands of refugees . &quot;
&quot; in case of a court hearing this week , the authorities argu@@ ed that the state should be authorized to buy 72 pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical businesses within the camp goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dresser services or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical restaurants . &quot;

&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who make the 72 pro@@ vis@@ or@@ atory business , but admitted that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture are completely comprehen@@ sible . &quot;

despite Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin remains fighting
&quot; despite his dis@@ appo@@ inting appearance at the Olympic time , Rad@@ professionals will not want to get Tony Martin . &quot;
&quot; I continue to keep the World Cup at a glance , remain confident and fighting , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he does not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar hat .
&quot; hon@@ estly , it was told me to comment on the time of yesterday . &quot; &quot; Martin said . &quot;
he had to analyse the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must be adjusted to the next generation of speed@@ ometers : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash units are tested , which are particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the fut@@ ur@@ istic en@@ forcement En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example to accident levels , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction site or to san@@ it@@ ating bridges with temporary Tem@@ ples , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure the speed limit of the speed limit . &quot;
a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or elabor@@ ate .
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days , the case data will be transmitted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously on several tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits , as well as flow rate for time , strip and vehicle class can also be monitor . &quot;
&quot; in the highly driven condition , one can move the trailer with each car with a trailer hook . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to be cleaned , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the mo@@ cks and the way also disappear outside bar@@ racks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the data of Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also fl@@ ashes with new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
&quot; great Britain has collected silver in the 7 @-@ player Rug@@ by , after the Fiji bring the Master@@ class Gold . &quot;
&quot; the impressive Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by arrived in the final on Thursday evening to a corrupt stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten with a score of 43 @-@ 7 in the de@@ mic stage here in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fiji distributed a master class in the handling , side step@@ ping , desc@@ endant , line @-@ run and ro@@ wer &apos;s power to win gold - their first match in each color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was reconc@@ iled by the non @-@ bad consol@@ ation prize - Great Britain at that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the significant defeat of the ground , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals at the same day could fall on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of it , Fiji had defeated a 15 @-@ man team in the form of its form . &quot;
&quot; it could be for GB a sol@@ ace , but it is probably not - at least a gold medal that will hang around his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is Chef trainer Ben Ryan , the former head for England from Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind it .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost every game in Adelaide Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they only lost one .
&quot; this fl@@ ap is we@@ aving , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fiji started wonderful and left the GB@@ S attack from fun .
&quot; it felt like the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , when it would run in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au pushed into the corner . &quot;
&quot; with another four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner which he turned . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely has the ball .
&quot; a great achievement of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it only stopped in Fiji . &quot;
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a put down a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the revival and there was still over one minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ macy through another weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion was a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is as if Fiji had been born to play , to play the 7 , while GB is still learning . &quot;
it is so too .
GB carried out fundamental changes to half @-@ time and completed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova had gone through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan N@@ ort@@ on started a test for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was already long in favour of the South se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans whose fans s@@ wings and d@@ anced at the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame translated the i bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff heard that Fi@@ j@@ is h@@ ug@@ ged and sm@@ itten the GB of the bell in the grass .
&quot; earlier on the day Fiji had defeated in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 defeated and Britain urged South Africa in a cr@@ ushing @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ k into the first half after the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke out the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gateway among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late with Marcus Watson , brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ axis teams , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no engine of gold as if they play with these games and what will be called .
&quot; from the first stro@@ kes to the last , 220 hard h@@ ie@@ ve , who go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only the conf@@ essions that were sitting at the ruin , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was present in succession as she became the second Olympic champion in a row without tax lady in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports which laid such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolute , at least their 3@@ 9.@@ en un@@ lawful use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ es , which reflects on the surface with the elegance of tails , which is not reflected the type of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in rowing , a batt@@ ali@@ on would contribute to the hel@@ pers that make the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
he said what ris@@ ky .
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a quite narrow situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had good luck that he could be the treatment beginning of 2014 , out of season , which could start the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that is the correct term under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I needed to go better soon . &quot;
it was an inc@@ entive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the rowing is already a challenge , but this makes it a bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ cess@@ ation of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a annoying morning so much more than anything else to speak and to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning who was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regim@@ ent in a use in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated just how much this means that , how much I and Helen and Robin have worked as Robin . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we were no one , therefore a massive thank you . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I would have no better person for coaching or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race lost in the last five years .
&quot; the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up . &quot;
&quot; even over the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to join , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to get involved .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not doing something like that .
&quot; today we wanted no fireworks , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
&quot; the couple will take place for one year , before making decisions about his future . &quot;
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding in their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I did not want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , exempl@@ ary for clarity &quot;
&quot; the managing director of the Water Institute of Water , R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavaria . &quot;
a small French drinking water @-@ purpose association as an example for large water producers .
thus it was some time ago in the origin@@ alt@@ on in the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk &apos;s article .
&quot; a little later , the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ ks preached the Pur@@ pose of Pur@@ su@@ ck . &quot;
the work of the v@@ eit@@ s group called &quot; Bavarian &quot; as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the company &apos;s purpose , was 28 years old as managing director . &quot;
now he was reti@@ re at the age of 65 .
&quot; the pot@@ able water @-@ purpose association with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with about 5500 residents . &quot;
&quot; the congregations are the congregations of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ah . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for further cities and communities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ ner &apos;s Mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ d B@@ ühl ( FW ) , remin@@ ded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller been set as a water@@ pro@@ stitute in 1985 and was appointed CEO of the purpose of the purpose in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; its tasks have been very diverse and they extend from water management and maintenance work on office and maintenance work , the bud@@ get@@ ary position , calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency conditions on weekends , &quot; said the chair@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding events , they called the commissioning and inauguration of the new well ( 1994 ) , basic piece in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the re@@ development of a central computer controller ( 2004 ) and the re@@ building of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no breast@@ feeding , and I always added new features , because water may cover life and drinking water the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her hands , she praised G@@ ö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has used a lot of heart blood for its water @-@ purpose association , and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association , as it would be his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was allowed to present the successful concert concept for the nit@@ rat@@ ory movement from the Water Forum of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia . &quot;
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller &apos;s part fi@@ anc@@ ée Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together for 28 years with him . &quot;
he is the best water @-@ wart and he was a loyal Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlights from his point of view , he called the Brun@@ n@@ enbau and the re@@ construc@@ ting of the purpose . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment , however , were the pi@@ ping at the sky@@ scra@@ per on a 3rd of January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night , so the villages with water could be supplied . &quot;
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn could only be maintained only because you filled the container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with sli@@ cks .
&quot; the management of drinking water was transferred to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who will follow the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;
the Sop@@ rano Anna Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko goes open to the aut@@ ism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other concerned parents : &quot; you have to have courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; the medicine made significant progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Sera . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , they believed it to die . &quot;
&quot; however , the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago has come to well and learn privately in New York where it is the best therap@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; in order to give an example : if I sang a bit of what two years back when I sang on Milan Scala , he remembers nothing , &quot; &quot; said Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko . &quot;

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has shot at his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.m .
&quot; the man himself called on us , and said to have shot his lifetime companion , &quot; said a pol@@ ze@@ al . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the escape , after him will be publicly announced . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown , brown and has a glass . &quot;
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
meanwhile the man is wearing a glass .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could carry the weapon for themselves , so the police . &quot;
&quot; whoever sees Sven S. , is supposed to call the 110 . &quot;
the police talks of a &quot; relationship at . &quot;
&quot; the victims was born 1988 , the perpet@@ rators in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the police in Lübeck initially wanted to do no data to the T@@ ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing deli@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more , &quot; said a police teacher in Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special operational unit ( SEK ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the risk @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains unchanged from additional costs in millions of millions .
&quot; out of the table , financial bur@@ dens which threatened the industry from green electricity funding are from the table . &quot;
&quot; in the liberation of renewable energies change in the German steel industry , Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) said the &quot; West German General Zeitung &quot; ( V@@ AZ , Friday edition ) in the German steel industry . &quot;
I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years .
&quot; according to the European Commission , the European Commission initially planned to use steel manufacturers to use the gas from the stove to electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry industry , the steel industry reached an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ . now there is a decision with the EU Commission to talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ camp .
&quot; only when generators be replaced in steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 per cent must be replaced . &quot;
but this will not be collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the EU Commission to qualify for its own production .
&quot; with this , the status Quo appeared to be largely fixed . &quot;
&quot; the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry , as well as for the steel industry . &quot;
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is the future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more needs to follow . &quot;
&quot; the IG Metall boss Jörg Hofmann explained in Frankfurt , too , with the reform of emissions laws . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering from over@@ capacity and a significant price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation intensi@@ fied further than the world &apos;s largest producer in China in view of its weak@@ ening domestic demand , designed steel on the global market . &quot;
European manufacturers t@@ oss Chinese steel concerts price d@@ umping .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has relaxed . &quot;
&quot; for a show in import tari@@ ffs on imported effect , the economic prospects in China have taken up . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how sustainable the pricing is ready .
the German industry pri@@ m Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained c@@ auti@@ ously on Thursday .
&quot; finally , prices would have stag@@ n@@ ated again . &quot;
the sector re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclu@@ de any lock@@ ers of individual works .
around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
&quot; in July , German steel manufacturers remain careful in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; they produced a total of 3.4 million tons of well than six percent less steel than in the previous year , such as the economic unification of steel on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the quantity returned to second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production increased by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
the association is calculated in the coming months thanks to an enhanced order situation with an increasing output .
&quot; community , Spirit , Health : singing - Senior Citi@@ zens &quot;
&quot; Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as young girl , she was in the school choir , in the teaching office she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 year old sings in a senior female choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and a total of live , she says . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , she does something good with her health and mind . &quot;
&quot; because singing is equal from several perspectives , a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior League . &quot;
&quot; most of the seniors sing in the choir , and share the joy of music , describes h@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular interaction , seniors social contacts can link and maintain . &quot;
&quot; for frequently , social and famili@@ al structures in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to discuss and organize , to learn to the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of coll@@ age . &quot;
&quot; singing can sing in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
because the elderly exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly calls his lungs as quickly as everyday use in everyday life .
&quot; even if it comes to the sound of the voice in the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the German Labour Association of Senior Citi@@ zens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the joint singing had a lot of priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains them . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often observed that singing or hearing of songs in elderly people often ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; by song tex@@ te and particularly melo@@ dies , people de@@ pressed people at long returned events . &quot;
&quot; when singing , the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concentrate on their own voice and to adapt to a pre@@ defined rhythm , and to adapt the other singers - this is a cogn@@ itive challenge . &quot;
&quot; just older people who live alone , do not only practice themselves on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns by singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ este@@ em is growing by singing in the choir .
&quot; to show themselves : if I &apos;m long for something , I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with the singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , shouldn &apos;t hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , says L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not only singing - with 50 singing people , who sounds there when a tone is next ? &quot;
&quot; searching for the appropriate offer , seniors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; someone singing in a veter@@ an &apos;s circle , one can easily connect . &quot;
many cities also offer views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
&quot; who wants to sing in a church choir , can turn directly to the church or the church . &quot;
many senior clubs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you have no access to the Internet , your family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you want to sing , an choir should be connected to an choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; sing the soul well , and has something fre@@ eing that applies to each age . &quot;
cats respond more sensitive than cr@@ ater to scre@@ ams of the young
bi@@ ologists studied in Hanover in which effect the effect of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys has grown to adult animals .
&quot; in their surprise , the male left the male too cold - but they beha@@ ved in the difference to the females always . &quot;
female cats can recognize the ground level of cat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they react to ten percent faster on the basis of kit@@ ten of K@@ itt@@ ens which have been found in great need , such as scientists from the Medical School and Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
kit@@ sch also react to the rest of K@@ itt@@ ens - but always at the same time .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently the acoustic differences between the che@@ wing of less and strongly er@@ ted young for the males either is not perc@@ ep@@ tible , or not of importance , &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; on this Friday .
&quot; in a previous study , the research team already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams are distingu@@ ishes with the care of their help . &quot;
a total of nine adult cat and eight specimens were observed from the livestock chain of the MH@@ H .

Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ch@@ r . &quot;
he was accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , a major soccer game takes place in Turkey . &quot;
before the du@@ el of the Erz@@ riv@@ alen between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is scheduled .
&quot; even in July , the government &apos;s suspension after the overthrow in July , the government , which should not be imp@@ aired by norm@@ ality of norm@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who are suspected , the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ülen is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
it is also not taken in front of the football .
&quot; against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r , the prosecutor &apos;s public prosecutor asked an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , he is accused of being a terrorist group in the Americas , a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ k@@ r is to be responsible for the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ülen , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; true , initially for 90 days , the emergency condition is still valid until October , in fact it actually has the life of most Turks but as good as no effects . &quot;
&quot; the no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided in followers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; clubs are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; however , in view of the most dramatic experiences in the history of the Turks , the strict re@@ jection of military coup . &quot;
there is even the fans everywhere - no matter if your heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ sieg@@ er &quot; Gala , &quot; it will come back to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne won its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association . &quot;
he scored the 1 : 0 victory in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce .
the newspaper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured his crew the cup .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for record champion was a reconc@@ iled conclusion . &quot;
after the round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League won the &quot; lions &quot; too early in the Europe League .
&quot; in the South of Li@@ g , it was only sixth place . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we made it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better . &quot;
&quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season of season the Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ shake is the base for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; at the AC Florence , under the contract standing and Bes@@ ik@@ tas had announced only a rented Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after its EM holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; club leader F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the storms would have to be willing to aband@@ on around one third of his to 7.5 million euros of yearly season , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; its content in Florence can &apos;t pay . &quot;
despite d@@ oping : this athl@@ ets still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was locked twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa may not start in Rio .
others led Athle@@ tics Championships can only laugh about - they are fighting in Rio by medals .
D@@ oping is determined by the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics Games .
the Russian swi@@ mmer in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa who compl@@ ained after a D@@ oping lock ( 100 meters of breast ) was kicked off and hat@@ ched off at their start ( 100 meters of breast ) .
it was a qu@@ ir@@ ky scen@@ eries : with a wre@@ cked smile she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked with her appearance .
&quot; as firm , that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a storm . &quot;
but there are still many more sport@@ s@@ men who go to the Rio Olympics in spite of D@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was closed for two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since his B@@ ann , the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the biggest chall@@ enger of Uz@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to sit down a six @-@ month lock , after taking the intake of pain using Oxy@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had been strong pain after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defended . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion from 2013 and European Championship was tested positively in 2010 to 2016 for the prohibited stim@@ ulation of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the in@@ sist@@ ent in@@ gest@@ ion and was imprisoned in six months .
the four wid@@ est throws this year go to the account of major gold fav@@ ors .
&quot; La@@ Shawn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested positive for 21 months in 2010 . &quot;
a means to increase penis enlargement may have been responsible for being Mer@@ ritt Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
&quot; Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : hardly any athl@@ ete were recognized as many medals . &quot;
&quot; so , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his WM title of 2005 nine years later , after having been diagnosed with him testosterone d@@ oping . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid d@@ op@@ ings and the EM title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse . &quot;
&quot; due to a judgement of the 2008 Olympic Games , Bron@@ z@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ ille won the 2008 Olympic Capital in 2008 . &quot;
with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is on rank two of the world ranking .
&quot; Liu Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold fav@@ it@@ in was positively tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion in the context of banned food supplements , the lock of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA has dropped mil@@ dly and ran on July 13 . &quot;
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian woman viol@@ ated - Sever@@ al deaths
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand up with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she suffered a chi@@ ves and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot;
she planned her hom@@ ebo@@ und tour in early September .
&quot; whether from further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Phu@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon also are also un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; in this respect , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stand in a permanent contact with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hua H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded by two bombs on Thursday night . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ change was killed and about 20 people died , including the Austrian woman , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning then two explo@@ sions went high again , and another man was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; also from Phu@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot;
&quot; in case of det@@ onation near the popular Ba@@ dest@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver has been viol@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded a municipal worker . &quot;
the explo@@ ding was according to the authorities in a flower bed in front of the Re@@ four of the coastal police into the air .
&quot; after all , even det@@ on@@ ations demanded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast several injured . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; said army General Dan@@ ai crit@@ eri@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it was too early to express itself on possible moti@@ ves , but probably the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media wanted to recognize patterns in the attacks , which is typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the Thai police declared that the attacks are not related to the Islam@@ ist movement or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sabot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , they assume that the bombs of the forces of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid . &quot;
the authorities have received sec@@ rec@@ y indications in the south of the country in the past few days - but they were not informed of the exact date and the locations .
&quot; still , it is un@@ clear that group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police ra@@ ced their officials throughout the country , security and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and pleasure . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bombs , but they usually do not judge for tourists . &quot;
Hua H@@ in is a palace that has been used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; according to reason of reason , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends the Austrian Foreign Ministry on his homepage , the instructions of Thai security authorities in an immediate result . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ves and its en@@ vir@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; according to disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , they are not necessary to travel to these provinces . &quot;
elevated safety risk ( security level 2 ) was claimed for the rest of the country .
&quot; a few days after a disputed referendum on Thursday and Friday , a few days after a controversial referendum . &quot;
this grants the military large influence in the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said that bombs have been an attempt to sti@@ fle chaos , while the country is moving toward stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody crimes , resi@@ des itself to have caused the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it did not have succeeded in getting the military in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
nearly one year ago in Bangkok there were killed in Bangkok at a very popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ pure 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack on the country &apos;s younger history .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is the visor of the Federal Office of constitutional .
&quot; after several nation@@ alities , the Constitu@@ ent of the Con@@ federation also have set the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; ident@@ ities &apos; Movement for aspir@@ ations against the Freedom of Democratic Republic , &quot; &quot; said Constitu@@ ent Head of Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants Islamic faith or from the Ne@@ ar East become diff@@ use diff@@ use . &quot;
therefore we watch the movement now .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; Un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and &quot; loss of personal identity through overseas . &quot;
&quot; constitutional complaint in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; ident@@ ities . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority compl@@ ying closely with the judges . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; ident@@ ities &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the perpet@@ ual Islam@@ ists as well as legal experts .
that is no bet@@ u@@ able advertising for your own thing .
the propaganda is supposed to be more emotional .
young people are due to sus@@ cep@@ tible in particular manner .
this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , in several federal states , it had given reports about contacts to the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; of Af@@ D policies . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he didn &apos;t have insights . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are relevant only from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - through certain people who are extrem@@ ist , changes its target and is so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; so , if such people have control the party on the party . &quot;
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase of legally off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right @-@ terrorism in this context . &quot;
but in recent years we &apos;ve found that there may be righ@@ tly @-@ terrorism structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
&quot; it can certainly be , that further just@@ ification group@@ ings or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , who plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers or attacks from other right @-@ related moti@@ ves . &quot;
but it is not identi@@ fi@@ able in Germany or across @-@ wide control of legal terrorism .
the existing groups were present on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; at the moment , Ma@@ ate concerned about that many people went to the account of people who had not emerged in the right scene before . &quot;
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ect in attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes committed before the hat , which were elected politically in@@ different , or for example , CDU , SPD or left , who are radic@@ alized by the right @-@ wing voting rights . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is used for inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
the Olympic Games or world records will not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous gig of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Rio de Janeiro in the summer .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ ge@@ ese s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slow that he wasn &apos;t able to see any more in the TV @-@ pictures . &quot;
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite afterwards . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 year old ended with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and reserved the 59@@ th place of 59 starters . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather his un@@ just sporty figure , which attracted attention to the attention of international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old takes part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start from the international swimming federation .
this is distributed to make swimming in different countries of well @-@ known countries .
&quot; as in Equ@@ at@@ op@@ ies , most sport@@ s@@ men run , I just wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
&quot; quickly , the first nickname made the round . &quot;
some media recorded it as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; the English tab@@ sheet &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made it funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only defeated a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run of Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i took home for media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable , the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle alone . &quot;
Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old took only eight months before the Olympia , and had never been a long distance before the competition . &quot;

&quot; during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , even over@@ - and under@@ covers from the previous calculations are excluded . &quot;
&quot; founded in all three se@@ wer@@ age increases , Schmidt based on all three se@@ wer@@ age systems with a very low se@@ wer@@ age , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic metres per year . &quot;
&quot; for example , due to the low distribution system , for example , expenses for the repair of several thousand euros would be gra@@ fted . &quot;
se@@ wer@@ age in all three plants are slightly decl@@ ining .
&quot; furthermore , during all three plants , the past three plants were not least represented in a considerable extent due to their age of rehabilitation and repair applications . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for world champion , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
&quot; in the se@@ wage plant , Schmidt proved that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf had to be exchanged due to a damage caused by pollut@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; in the pump pole , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old convey@@ ing facilities had to be over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed and at the pond water treatment , L@@ opp had to be installed after almost 20 years of operation of the first sep@@ tic pond , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge flow and an additional ventil@@ ating option to be able to keep the water legal specifications in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenditure , the continued operation and maintenance costs , which are considered to be considered in the new calculations period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 was still clearly below the current level . &quot;
stone houses made clear that at low san@@ itation in the three plants the expenditure for operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; thus , Schmidt , the market town of large maintenance costs , has remained in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned facilities will continue to continue pre@@ ju@@ ly , especially since one could not expand the supply of water @-@ purpose Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ oc@@ al to these facilities , because it is a de@@ od@@ or@@ tive facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % in Bulgaria in July 1 % .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) , and the first has been posted on zero since October of last year , as a positive 0.2 % . &quot;
the annual average income of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; consumer prices in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and annual inflation compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell by clothes and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; Mo@@ bi@@ liar , household goods and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained in the pre@@ mon@@ ate with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; effect as an as@@ ian caric@@ ature crit@@ ici@@ zed
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired by anim@@ e , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel against races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows some 150 million daily Us@@ ers to change reality and to play with ident@@ ities such as a way that is already leaving the Ab@@ sur@@ de . &quot;
&quot; you can transform themselves into an pine@@ apple , a dog or a character that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings . &quot;
&quot; the filters are non @-@ blo@@ wn , independent tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ ects per day . &quot;
all failure rates enter the public .
&quot; Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past , in which they were accused that the app would prop@@ agate Black@@ face to prop@@ agate or white skin as beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when there was a filter in some users , who gave them a filter which gave them sn@@ akes , false teeth and sto@@ cked che@@ eks , they called some critics a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they asked whether this repeated contro@@ versy was imp@@ acted to a larger problem , that the company has di@@ vers@@ atility . &quot;
&quot; the news and indig@@ nation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
&quot; however , out@@ si@@ ders that have experienced rac@@ ism , remin@@ ded the filter of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others have taken the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail grace as@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose T@@ we@@ et has widely spread over the photos that the filter &quot; inj@@ uri@@ ous , and mil@@ dly said un@@ pleasant . &quot;
&quot; she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ part of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot;
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ lay@@ ered , but that the yellow is drawn into the extreme extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crossed this cultural pride .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in endless diversity and integration amp@@ f , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are in the stuff of various other than their older opponent - could be more likely to expect sen@@ si@@ vity .
&quot; when one of the Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture that for one user is offensive , &quot; so it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided to work as a product manager and engineer working for media to er@@ ase their Snap@@ chat account , others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a phone interview , she said that Turkey @-@ related contro@@ versy sur@@ ren@@ ders a lack of di@@ vers@@ eness at the snap@@ shot of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the great part white and only male leadership and ended its attachment with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the chin@@ ese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions , in which they are safe or comfortable to say what to say . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint which has largely left the Snap@@ chat un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; the company does not publish numbers of diversity of its workforce , and shows his status as private companies . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat , on Thursday , refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to an office , the company recently set a personnel responsible that focuses on under@@ line population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; in the part of its part , Z@@ hu said that she is closed to her Snap@@ chat account , and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users as we need to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military management , ISIS intelligence information , represents the Congress of Congress &quot;
&quot; members of the United States Central Command changes en@@ viable information to draw a optimi@@ stic @-@ scale picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it permits the actual conditions of Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Armed Forces , reported by big dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret service analysts , reported how to change their ass@@ essments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; perio@@ dical information , which were typically worn by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com Commander , recorded a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism when it had allowed the actual conditions of other news services , quoted a newspaper article published . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable to our soldiers when bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republican member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the management errors in Cent@@ Com can range up to the top of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed consistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there are no direct indications that government tips has given to Obama &apos;s instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts agree on the pressure of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements before the congress were clearly positive as it was &quot; the report . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , second @-@ largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , it is much clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can Congress from Kansas , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the mid @-@ year 2014 to the mid @-@ year of 2015 , the points of Central Command changed the agreement to enter the danger due to ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after them , analysts concern about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the report published on Thursday , will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations will continue . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Secretary of Defense in the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
democratic members of the Intelligence Advisory Board published their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force .
&quot; in the years of 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com received a revised process for the creation of retro@@ spective evaluation of Isi@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest @-@ level democr@@ at in the Com@@ intern , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , was delayed the publication of retro@@ spective reports , &quot; &quot; the mor@@ ality contained in analysts and &quot; gave &quot; excessive space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats stated , no hin@@ ts on the intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st have found in terms of a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot; &quot;
preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times conducted an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s inspec@@ torate , which were included according to the complaints of Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press review of the Pentagon , issued in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the general inspection were still underway . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noted that &quot; experts sometimes have quite gr@@ ating opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful air campaign in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year however did not have the question that President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest ass@@ essments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis areas . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of Zwi@@ st@@ ats of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a font in Iraq , looked at the recommendations of many analysts at the time of many analysts , referring to the consequences of the 2003 invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker demonstrates that contrary to government statements , the team had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , because these pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical refin@@ eries had taken into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this realization was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ re@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was crit@@ ici@@ zed by members of the legisl@@ atures because of its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
General Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US win fourth match in the field @-@ hockey in the women , show@@ down a show@@ down with Britain before &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually show a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in memory .
&quot; however , they know this : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic Contest and are simultaneously in their group with the Brit@@ ons to remain unbe@@ aten in their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will participate in the last match of the first round on Saturday .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two teams will reach the first and second place within their group . &quot;
&quot; the first @-@ placed race will go somewhat longer out of the way , which will lead the other group . &quot;
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans passed through their success story a surprising vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ e , four years after having landed in the past London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ rie in hands ( her two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
it missed the Olympics in 2008 as they could not qualify for the ca@@ des .
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team went wrong .
&quot; in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work place in London that we have now .
we can ri@@ p the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
&quot; India had gone without victory in the tournament without victory , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the play of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; it accomplished a Sprint with the flat ball on the left fl@@ ank , then moved into the middle and open the ball to the US in order to raise the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 leadership . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the Tor@@ hil@@ ation of the USA , Jack@@ ie bri@@ gs , who previously had to spend a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a barrel .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ins &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , too late , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel continuous and in@@ different , a shaving relay between competition and Stre@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; it is like the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which is used by the wrist@@ bands for the Turner &apos;s tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t switch on television , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the qu@@ eue , without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is still Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dimples , could possibly be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ TV advertising when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner , or even F@@ real . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting with gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; further from the center , some in the shade there are sports that are not generally accepted : air@@ gun shoot , ar@@ chery , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ swim and may reign for long .
&quot; but if I should make a modest arguments in my particular dar@@ ling , then leave me attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the tr@@ ol@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; although the tr@@ ol@@ in@@ jump already has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was the last 16 years that many things I had questioned , did not know that there is a Olympic port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
&quot; even though the United States sent athletes to be competition , there has never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jump and had won a athl@@ ete until 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans to share the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal in London .
&quot; the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jump has a certain exterior char@@ tered , partly because it sounds for the un@@ explained ear @-@ fitting for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as those who sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert but only a bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ ors of his never to end , but also the Gra@@ zie of the Turn@@ ens and Tau@@ ern , which combines two sports that is essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means a lot like &quot; jumping board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; jump winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must land a number of falling movements ( turning , H@@ genuine and Sal@@ tos ) before landing at the feet . &quot;
you will be rated according to the official Olympic program according to version , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio each other . &quot;
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts hoping to continue in their quest for gold , faster , upward and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and back , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall , but also in television broadcast another hell@@ ish goal : the world or the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the targeted stre@@ wing is no@@ bel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to touch even a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but it is also what I feel like watching this games as a bit more fatigue .
the trampoline offers a breath@@ able .
the v@@ ector of the Tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ spr@@ inger is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t , apparently he@@ avi@@ est as an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes upward , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly upwards . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no v@@ nia in the distance , just the dre@@ aming , elegant storage of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final cleaning of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will end the end as part of a afternoon blo@@ c on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympics mania they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked during the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase of consciousness can only be reached by att@@ itudes and the objec@@ tion of male athletes - as it proposed the male US Turner , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his to air rin@@ gency , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the United States &quot;
violent protest in Ethiopia
&quot; protest@@ ers , the political changes in Ethiopia , demand on violent resistance of the government . &quot;
witnesses say that four@@ ty Protest@@ ants were killed during cl@@ ashes with police in fire@@ arms .
is Ethiopia just going to break together ?
&quot; in the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid consortium with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government sho@@ ok the country and continued more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people fell on roads and requested fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s answer was non @-@ merciful . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot dead un@@ armed protest@@ ers and killed .
&quot; still in circulation videos on protests , which are probably from the last or early of this year , show how safety skin young people are forced to beat , while these were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights now demands a further investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country and future will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services works closely with the Ethiop@@ ians , to fight terrorism beyond the region , particularly in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy is expanding its remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dra@@ stically improved - there is a new end@@ anger in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; roads are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously established the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dis@@ sidents have been effectively transferred to silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile , or sent into prison , or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options , except protest@@ ing , breaks it out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation Protestant .
there are numerous appe@@ als that cover everything from the ground @-@ use until sausages in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following a further critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , ten@@ sions go along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a fight for these z@@ ack@@ y , controversial line called in June hundreds of life . &quot;
&quot; analysts are afraid that separat@@ ist like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been more or less forced in recent years , could use turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of the bit@@ ing after years are explo@@ ding under the surface now .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ian people were able to communicate with the social media , as cheap Smartphones was more common and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , so many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies , hiding where they stop . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians said that they were gathered for protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since Ä@@ onen , Am@@ har@@ as , who are mainly christ@@ ened from eth@@ n@@ op@@ sies of the predominantly Christian flood countries , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and in low@@ lands . &quot;
but this also changes .
&quot; we are involved in coordin@@ ating under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests were place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account for around 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military , in the intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up to his death in an un@@ sealed illness in 2012 for 17 years , Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was viewed as tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think of corners . &quot;
&quot; analysts say that it was especially pos@@ ing in it , to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special auth@@ oriz@@ ations to make opponents and make it harmful . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is missing in this fundamental game , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiop@@ ian Mountains , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am come from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he enjoys not the confidence of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a ri@@ ot in 2005 , after thousands of elections are prot@@ ested by the government , according to analysts of the government , and then stolen by the government . &quot;
&quot; while the following Raz@@ ents were killed many protest@@ ants , even if it were less than in the last months , and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts , Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new end@@ anger , as well as for their measur@@ able progress in poverty . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensive abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , Protest@@ ants attacked in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ian town , headed by Tig@@ ray , and hatred opposite the Tig@@ ray is always more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that protests the USA and other western allies bring in an independent position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ ians via neighboring Somalia , even if she recently announced that she closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to assemble his ally in a more vol@@ atile area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin free migration . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explained his statement Obama was founded ISIS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy to disp@@ el his campaign by repe@@ ating that his multi @-@ repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group of Islamic State , not seriously . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication , new questions on the communication skills of the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate and comprehen@@ sible to communicate with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings together his fellow @-@ stre@@ ak , which stri@@ ve to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , in the pec@@ uli@@ ar position to explain what he could not . &quot;
&quot; after he had taken the suggest@@ ion at a election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump in regards to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he was really not intended to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et said Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day , at which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the exc@@ use is perfectly serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate wanted nothing to know . &quot;
the last storm of critic@@ isms le@@ ak down on Mr. Tr@@ ump while trying to draw the focus of his campaign due to falling changes to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking at the Michigan of Michigan in this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this topic . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her talk boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July , he went on strong criticism as he said that Russians should be Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he said &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the lingu@@ istic borders in politics and then back as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are absorbed by his fans , how they arrive , and then if appropriate &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication sex@@ ist , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe it is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an even corro@@ sive tone because its circum@@ spec@@ ulation has declined . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a guided lead to the North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally attempted to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics , to dist@@ orted his testimony , or false to his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while he increases the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal Mit@@ stre@@ iter to the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ant his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps , prominent c@@ ach@@ ers , gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in an CNN interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments , &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned about the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama was ISIS an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ b@@ än@@ kler , completely un@@ true , and therefore it happened , because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstre@@ am Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government served under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Minister for Foreign Affairs , to allow ISIS to spread out the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; prior to the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and worshipped them , on each of his words , and to be pre@@ set against him . &quot;
&quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , &quot; e@@ un@@ u@@ chs &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t . &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked on Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Ent@@ ap@@ ology as a further evidence that he was in@@ appropriate for the Presidency .
&quot; once pushed over the price of the market , café in Green@@ point comes back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ amed café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ in front . &quot;
&quot; the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie shop , set up in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people have been used as last loss in a genetically modified city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still cannot believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is change , then it is new . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new version has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot;
&quot; he began working in Ver@@ b in 2001 , and remained there until the end . &quot;
&quot; as a customer , a customer offered to provide money for a new outside service , it was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b used the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old dec@@ ay .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment too .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu , sand@@ wiches are covered with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages such as cap@@ ers and auti@@ ous onions . &quot;
there is natur@@ alist dishes .
&quot; the café serves no beer anymore , there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ guez told that he noticed a silent power to the old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed through prizes in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the dec@@ ay had closed , she gave a while for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was in the coffee and on the culture of Ver@@ b , which pleased me , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered that day instead of their usual iced coffee and ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered immort@@ al forever .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss @-@ watch watch and they prepare my Everything ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ guez , he wanted to experiment and receive new ingredients into the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays , Ros@@ enthal gets his usual order but sometimes he changes his Everything @-@ ba@@ gel with bacon , eggs and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he does not have a lot about it that the soap shop has taken up the old business area .
&quot; in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie will actually make a special soap for b @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of coffee bars as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go to her offer , &quot; Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish citizens Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ guez , and Rodri@@ guez told that he will soon introduce her new neighbors . &quot;
the location also has further advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ local wants to fill the cold baked coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new exp@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer , and said he was destroyed in the ground , when the café lock . &quot;
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the bet@@ ting of the Lok@@ as and the purch@@ aser felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressed meal of the economic crisis in &quot; a abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a delic@@ acy , President Roosevelt had a Fai@@ ble for refined del@@ ik@@ at@@ essen on Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water@@ ways soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was something modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée and as dessert a p@@ ud@@ men@@ p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA while taking part in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the Food Per@@ spective .
&quot; her newest cooperation , &quot; An independent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , star@@ chy I@@ mb@@ iss at Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since its IP@@ crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; sealed , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese with olive oil , while co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable ate . &quot;
&quot; as the reporter sho@@ ots , this took a couple of discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; Z@@ iegel@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; there were pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap which scatter@@ ing the ingredient .
imagine how many peanuts eat that they serve them as dinner .
gr@@ ins and gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have set itself in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women co@@ ves for male Fel@@ dar@@ er and served fresh baked past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans that sand@@ ed during the first World War . &quot; &quot; Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; stands the way , with whom the country went on , not to be the s@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans a central , ang@@ ed issue was &quot; buried , why he and his wife wanted to write . &quot;
&quot; the new budgets was the new budget : myst@@ ical foods such as bre@@ ads and can@@ als were added to basic nut@@ riti@@ ous , the cult remains of a &quot; wonderful type , eating remains &quot; , &quot; since ch@@ efs un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients could hide in a creamy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced with cheap dry ob@@ ese .
&quot; meat that was the center of the American kitchen for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; pec@@ uli@@ ar bl@@ ends were tried , because a cal@@ orie rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction was prec@@ eded by taste or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Z@@ iegel@@ man prepared a court from this ep@@ och , baked potatoes with pean@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
brick carries out : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked potatoes do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the laundry concept .
&quot; as never before or since then , budget defic@@ its - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; having published recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; budget sp@@ ol@@ ites &quot; and to transform P@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with carrots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical treats .
&quot; in particular , are the reports about the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake food . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farms in kitchen of his kitchen , he sp@@ it like the million@@ aire @-@ heavy man of the world to whom he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental kitchen such as fish with cucum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a smo@@ king .
he was wonderful realistic .
&quot; President Roosevelt could perhaps have committed the same error , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have invited him to stat@@ u@@ ate with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , it was described as a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors due to Mrs. Roosevelt , that the White House brought the bo@@ red food in Washington , but also one of the most consol@@ es prepared . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was rejected once the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , Z@@ iegel@@ man said , as well as science applied on food . &quot;
&quot; by writing the book , the pair was able to understand the eating habits of Z@@ iegel@@ mans mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
bri@@ ck@@ man remin@@ ded : &quot; they actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind@@ fall incident .
&quot; after the plates were cleared in Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they stri@@ pped and co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um termin@@ ates , the President Roosevelt at noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man and added that it was a common trick that recipes a nice name to miss . &quot;
&quot; there was no proposed cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; each one di@@ pped a spo@@ on@@ ful spoon into the fenced , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it tasted not bad .
CO@@ E was repeated three times a night .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ get@@ ary , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
death attack against bombs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar devoted his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked all to save the lives of others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died himself with a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that saved some 60,000 men according to the newspaper newspaper so far . &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers set their own life on the game to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to make the first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil protection that shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue from the ruins of a house that went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the shining symbol@@ ism in the horror of war .
&quot; however , as heroes , he has never seen himself , said according to the image : &quot; for me it is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar himself fell victim to a victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have cast four façade bombs above the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlor@@ inated gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the pois@@ oned remains of the bomb so that no children play with it , &quot; &quot; the image quotes his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Green@@ land@@ hai : the oldest cycl@@ tier is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually come only in the winter to the surface .
this Ha@@ i was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swim with a good 1 km / h in the North Atlantic today .
Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie got only 150 years old .
&quot; in fact , Green@@ land@@ shar@@ ks along the bottom of the North Atlantic along , in an hour , on average , it is just 1.@@ 220 meters far . &quot;
&quot; only if it comes to it , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a sat@@ in 2.6 km / h - and it &apos;s half a top speed as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle of lon@@ el@@ iness , however , seems to be a sponsor@@ ship for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues will report in the journal &quot; Science , &quot; anyway , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; said Alexander Sch@@ ill@@ lein of the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock , which means a world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the Evol@@ ution@@ s@@ bi@@ ologist presum@@ ed that Greenland &apos;s stone is likely to become old . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are hard to observe , after all , they live especially in the ice sea from Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because water temperatures prefer around six degrees Celsius , they appear on the surface usually only in the winter . &quot;
&quot; about the lifestyle of Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , researchers do not know little . &quot;
&quot; her tim@@ est@@ amp fl@@ ates them , as they equi@@ val@@ ed six animals with a transmitter . &quot;
&quot; this shar@@ ks still make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swallowed up the ja@@ w bones of a young polar bears . &quot;
possibly they hunt for sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and look ca@@ da@@ ver looking down from higher water layers according to the bottom .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen from the depths of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centi@@ meters long , while the biggest 502 cm measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of animals , they analyzed with the Carbon @-@ 14 method the lens core of the shar@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; this center of the eye lens arises before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which contained proteins will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
&quot; their birth was therefore , after the early 1960s , when nuclear tests have caused major quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the course of 220 centi@@ meters in length of the third tier , the lens core contained a low excess of carbon @-@ 14 out of the nuclear weapons , so it is likely to celebrate his 50th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; in their lens , they had a normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 @-@ Clock showed a 4@@ 93 @-@ cm long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k an old age of 335 years , whereas the record @-@ Ha@@ i could even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
that Greenland @-@ females can only get offspring when they are longer than four meters .
the researchers were able to as@@ sign the length of the length .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters are probably on the threshold for sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie is obviously at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this is likely to be the world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live especially in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland , in whose bacon on the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on top , was caught on Alaska . &quot;
due to the low temperatures often the body of the animals live there on spar@@ ing flame .
so it ri@@ ms later - and al@@ ign slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , animals are often particularly large . &quot;
because the volume grows much faster than its surface due to the animal heat .
&quot; as a result , the heat loss of a gram of mouse is much larger than the elephant . &quot;
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal is more dangerous and should focus on it as possible as many descendants as possible , &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , a very large animal should be investing more in a long life . &quot;
building plot in double pack
&quot; with topics around the construction , the community at the youngest session has focused on the most recent session . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the panel received the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently proven housing can start . &quot;
&quot; after the plot , par@@ zel@@ li@@ zation and maintenance issues were clari@@ fied and the applications could be placed on request , the sale of plots in the housing areas &quot; Stre@@ ets &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Selected section 1 ) to the interested we have nothing more in the way . &quot;
&quot; the Municipal Council is convinced that the blo@@ wers in the rural @-@ shaped and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau young families , and other senior citizens alike . &quot;
&quot; as it was , the approval from now on the town hall can be cons@@ ul@@ ted immediately in the town hall , on the awar@@ ding of the plots is expected to advise in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to do further requests to the her@@ mit of further industrial companies , combined with the creation of job creation , the Municipal Council decided to change the area of area planning in part in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; so in the area of under@@ age , the commercial area has been expanded there by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ xit
&quot; in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city has the best chance to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the excellence of competence financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bre@@ xit , it is uncertain whether cash stores continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU pass , the approval for the so @-@ called EU pass is sufficient . &quot;
that is just great US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to leave jobs .
&quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying Association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; will reck@@ on with 10000 new jobs at the Main , within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities like European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less important for the financial sector less significant than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the Not@@ ebook is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in Luxembourg , Luxembourg visited a great fund sector , cut off as well as Dublin at the infrastructure worse . &quot;
Frankfurt am clearly easier to reach in Frankfurt thanks to the big airport .
there are also a city with a easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; in Paris it is not that easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; at the Seine , the Mi@@ xed for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than the main . &quot;
furthermore there is a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
&quot; in a ranking by the company consultancy Mer@@ cer stand the city on number 7 , Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 and Paris on No.@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with his already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; he ref@@ uses I@@ W . &quot;
but London remains the most important financial centre in Europe despite the most important financial researchers in Europe .
&quot; similarly , power relations : in London , according to figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
&quot; a US National judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the refund of the just@@ ification , which , created by the Hep@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot;
&quot; in June Gilead was liberated from a compensation deposit of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , who were in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medicines in Sov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , after a U.S. judge issued a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other in@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; in case of case of the law@@ suit on Thursday , US administration in Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to pay the cost during the defense of the F@@ alles . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to su@@ stain Gilead with Gilead , which ruled the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck also def@@ endants each other , and owned by the laboratory , So@@ fos@@ bu@@ vi@@ r , active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead . &quot;

&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the extract of the remaining group of fighters , who have dig@@ ged within the city , are currently under the city . &quot;
&quot; they liberated over 2,000 civilian individuals who were held ho@@ stage as host@@ ages , divided Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish to Reuters Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Reuters with the D@@ KS . &quot;

&quot; Clin@@ t earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal states &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Hillary Clinton published their tax declar@@ ations for 2015 , which resulted in the democr@@ ats and her husband to pay an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clin@@ t donated $ 1 million for beneficial purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in phr@@ ases ; the former Foreign Minister issued an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book about their term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ t candidate for the Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declar@@ ations of the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to continue standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ t Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mas announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a cr@@ ushing contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false pron@@ unci@@ ation and re@@ tra@@ cts in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; it is usual for US presidential candidate to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a control review by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s electoral campaign Ian Sam@@ i wrote on Twitter , referring to the publication of the Presi@@ dential candidate . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Co@@ hen , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Advisor to CNN that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax checks are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , amongst others also the republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already abandoned that his ref@@ us@@ al questions arise regarding assets , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already over@@ thrown on the theme and released a video on the Internet in the high ranking Rep@@ ublic@@ ans Tr@@ ump immediately release his tax returns .
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke about the subject of a speech to the Michigan economy . &quot;
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last decades , and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid out during the 1990s for two years , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax @-@ forests and tax advis@@ ers , the information that it might be the case . &quot;
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
&quot; Clinton supports a provision that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million and pay a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during a election event for Hillary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka urged the buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters to exchange their tax returns . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he had been subjected to the IRS as well as a control test of the IRS , and is not afraid of &quot; fear &quot; in front of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ t Camp@@ aign has released tax returns , until 2007 . &quot;
&quot; the Clin@@ t , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective Federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax returns of the Clin@@ t from 2015 showed that these only USD 100 is involved in its income as a salary , unlike most of the Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main money investment was a cost @-@ effective financial fund , from which Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and yields of USD 10@@ 9,000 . &quot;

&quot; the method has proved to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had been intensi@@ fying the idea before years , together with the U.S. natural protection , trained to use volunteers in villages in the North of Tanz@@ anian , to use a non@@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their houses and harvest@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; before , many speakers have used to defend themselves . &quot;
&quot; Friday is the telephone day , dedicated to animal protection . &quot;
&quot; since we have developed the ...

the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles in a horn .
&quot; if he is not deported , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown . &quot;

a touch right in the rule already emerged to hunt the eleph@@ ants .
&quot; one last possibility represents a value , which causes a gol@@ fer fire into the air and caused a lu@@ te , light explosion . &quot;

Jewish director sm@@ ashing the Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; to be removed - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media watch after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no Israeli pre@@ fix , as the Arabian guests would have requested according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ a left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by giving an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of hotels . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between countries that can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; what is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via an own call center . &quot;
&quot; after a statement , the director turned to the hotel concept . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; just like Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
the hotel stated that the measure was a &quot; clear decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
&quot; the reason , which stood behind , dissolved in the director , even more anger . &quot;
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they demands that the pre@@ fix is extingu@@ ished , &quot; the employees was quoted from Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man named this a &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled from this event .
that is really very appe@@ aling .
the fact that in Germany this hotel chain has been divided into exactly this hotel chain is even a greater dis@@ grace .
no explanation requires this .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a fairly large response to the Internet , where people called it a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had been given the alleged sign@@ age of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; ashamed of you , it was told in another post where it was pointed out that the hotel that is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , located near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all accus@@ ations , and called &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not record into the quick@@ dial list , &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , add that the country code has now been added . &quot;
police sets Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against protest@@ ant Brazilian students
&quot; students get together on Thursday in the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo , together with the police , when they were gathered to demonstrate against reforms of the government for public education system . &quot;
the police made Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against protest@@ ers .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers attempted to split the students , which led to the police g@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals from the governor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the participants saw Gra@@ ff@@ it@@ its on the provisional President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators in masses on the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ ed President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which was revealed through a vote of the Senate to their con@@ vocation from the office . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading rate between Moscow and Teheran grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year @-@ year comparison . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest of Russian companies grew strong on businesses in the country , the amb@@ ass@@ adors grew heavily . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to make access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further commercial construction is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan said . &quot;
&quot; he realized that the trading rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade show was reached by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year of a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign policy represented around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries that affects tourist areas in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken down from the last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses wanted : beverage market to be invaded in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL was pract@@ ised by the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the content of a gun weapon , three dark disgu@@ ised persons requested by the employee of the beverage market , removal of cash and fled first to foot and then probably with a silver coloured VW @-@ Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money is exploited , the police shares not . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters in size , so relatively small . &quot;
the Be@@ we market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; the perpet@@ rators must be tra@@ pped after the incident towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and fled from opposite to the car @-@ by car park with the silver coloured car , possibly in direction B 256 ( sleeping ring ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have made a observations on the crime time ( at 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , is urgent to the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : game and fun at summer time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and adolescents of the social @-@ ped@@ agog@@ ical day group / social group work in the Nag@@ old , with their co@@ aches at their summer time in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Mü@@ hl@@ ack@@ ers . &quot;
in the quiet Frei@@ zei@@ thei@@ m Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joy@@ ful group was qu@@ il@@ ted during the first school week of school week . &quot;
several day trips were standing on the program .
for one went to Britt@@ ten with the visit to the Sp@@ el@@ z@@ oos .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : Pil@@ gri@@ t to the gates of Mer@@ cy
the minist@@ rants from the Soul unit Ey@@ oc@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were handled . &quot;
&quot; in order to over@@ take the time until the next Prussian ship of all ministers in two years , the Minister of Ministers decided to prepare a round of St. Anna to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgri@@ m@@ ages aims to be tested and finally decided to visit the Bisch@@ o@@ fs@@ stadt Freiburg , where this year , for the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , the Mer@@ cy of Mer@@ cy concluded a special pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is made of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ zimmern , rose up the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , the parish of Stor@@ y@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ds and divided the Pil@@ gri@@ m . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , it was driven by train to the position of Vill@@ ingen , where also a Mu@@ enster Un@@ ser@@ er woman is standing and so the pilgrimage was driven away from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were en@@ cir@@ cled in the morning and evening , each with a brief stimul@@ us with different prayers , songs and tex@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is made on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches to sing together a song from a specially made pilgrims song . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , each parish of the local parish was available . &quot;
in the Et@@ app@@ enz@@ iel@@ en Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for a tasty and persistent dinner and breakfast .
&quot; on the second day , Fur@@ tw@@ angen went to G@@ üt@@ enbach on the second day . &quot;
&quot; tags : one came out the stage for St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting track , but had to be sw@@ apped around 500 meters of altitude in the heat and afterwards . &quot;
the earned reward was a joint gr@@ illing in the evening .
&quot; after the morning of the morning , at the imposing Pil@@ gri@@ mage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final step after Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; confident and happy , the Min@@ is met in the late afternoon at the Frei@@ burger Münster in the afternoon and through the gates of mercy . &quot;
thanks to a small stimul@@ us it was given thanks to God .
&quot; at the evening Mass in Münster , Min@@ is welcomed by Ko@@ fi Mark O@@ bert &apos;s pilgrimage destination . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims was able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ ze metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants were involved , that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong common experience were min@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; Scot@@ sman Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner is stor@@ med home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cyclists finish &quot;
&quot; Scotland Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner ra@@ ged last night in the Män@@ od@@ rom in Rio , the fame when British team defended the title of London 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the role of An@@ chor@@ us who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . he made the legend proud , when he stor@@ med home to home a victory of the favorite New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympics medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick after it stayed in March at the railway world championships in London , despite the return of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time when Hin@@ des appeared .
Ho@@ ys retirement a gap to close the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
&quot; S@@ kin@@ ner was the man with whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the sc@@ ot@@ tos , which is now un@@ folding . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - that were winning four years ago with Ho@@ y - and S@@ kin@@ ner settled in the quali@@ fications rounds , but in stand@@ alone the New Zealand winners won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ denburg was barely back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and S@@ kin@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a large part of the transformation , in which Hin@@ ds drove in a higher speed to slow him , and to enable Kenn@@ y and to enable S@@ kin@@ ner to hold the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC specialist and fell S@@ kin@@ ner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they rose to the podium . &quot;
the 23 year old S@@ kin@@ ner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we have placed an Olympic champion in the final round and defe@@ ats the world champion .
it was just amazing .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the site Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys gave orders to see that after a weak start he was intenti@@ onally adjusted .
he returned this statement later and there was no objec@@ tion of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with this victory , there was no such problem for this time . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; It feels with all the GB flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot;
we came together in the last three months as a team .
we have been so bad in so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which has won seven of 10 titles in Beijing as well as in London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of identification , it is possible in the realm of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y , who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the coming from Ho@@ y is equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the Sprint that begins today and will go over three days .
the 28 year old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
feel some lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten up to the Kn@@ ights . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were further good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll quali@@ fies with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometer race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the Race , at the Wig@@ gins of Safety in the focus . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , he had fought against the qualification in front of the qualification , called to measure the officials to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the appropriate Frauen@@ competition that will continue tomorrow and ends , av@@ anc@@ ated Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald in the world record time of 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB Team is leaving his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring an attempt to medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing , London and London became the expectations for Rio . &quot;
&quot; Dr@@ ums played back in the background , so the resignation of the technical leader Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton , in April , nestled in the heart of sex@@ ism and mo@@ ons , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like that the legendary reputation GB@@ S , who has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again . &quot;
future of melting of Portland due to lifting the energy supply fra@@ grant
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ t@@ ze from Portland , Victoria , and hundreds of jobs of workers - are on the game since the plant operator shall cancel the energy supply contract , so that all shipping companies will take away . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to use the plant . &quot;
a sub@@ sid@@ y for 20 years is running in November .
&quot; up to 2,000 jobs in the complex of Al@@ coa in Portland , stand on the game . &quot;
not less than 2000 work@@ stations - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ o@@ effects , as the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry melting , which led last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money , and ris@@ ked a closure . &quot;
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the current price of the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which delivers the big aluminium mel@@ ody with its Lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ an Valley , provided that three further owners will be announced that three other owners will be announced . &quot;
&quot; the facility is located in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means further physical demand for electricity by the melting point , &quot; divided the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to continue , that the &quot; &quot; securing transactions &quot; &quot; are supposed to be into force in November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; contracts have a 12 month notice period , so they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the power supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L from G@@ J 18 are currently restricted by the forecasts of strong markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; AG@@ L distributed the value of the contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination &quot; in anticip@@ ation of the contracts . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to make tre@@ aties , the &quot; ability of Alco@@ as ... &quot; to operate the melting plant , or ensure the power supply to ensure melt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the US company said that in 2010 it had completed a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have to enter into force in November this year , even if there is still a statement , why it has been signed from the contract . &quot;
analysts war@@ n because of the bad economic conditions in the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
&quot; in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland would consume around 600 meg@@ awatts of electricity every year . &quot;
&quot; should both plant disappear from the market , it would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a power generator , that would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vog@@ ue issue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Cl@@ ans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the U.S. Vog@@ ue . &quot;
&quot; E@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on its Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers brought me to weeping , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an ) , as well as the most popular show@@ bi@@ z @-@ On@@ es and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she ends the cover of her sister and ends with a classic we@@ dge : you have planned all a surprise partner . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ ee@@ ar@@ rests act almost every birthday party ( Se@@ ac@@ rest assured the sentence , &quot; &quot; You did remember that we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a Sen@@ de@@ platz at 8 am ) , but Kris had to take part in this public@@ ity . &quot;
a new era of kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue issue .
&quot; big sister Kim likes her to have beaten the Vog@@ ue Cover ( she and her husband Can@@ ye West , on April 2014 ) , but the cover of September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vog@@ ue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference , which rather resem@@ bles a picture tape as a fashion magazine , the output is a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ st@@ ars is expected that in the last two years pictures of the journal were still le@@ ak@@ ened before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the Model@@ n &quot; as &quot; models , the celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 for the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
but even at low chance that Ms J@@ enner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of their generation - under the earlier category is found in good company .
&quot; these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous persons , or reality stars or young people of today who know how to make a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to J@@ enner ) . &quot;
they are really talented women looking for in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success anyway .
&quot; with its reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was always a bit sc@@ anned in the fashion world . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called them &quot; the mist@@ ress of the eye .
these feelings co@@ ves up again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but on the way of fail@@ ures seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vog@@ ue issue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your base of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
they and all her sisters sell pictures from themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine .
&quot; and in her free time , she is watching TV in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children . &quot;
&quot; annually of communal centres , 160@@ ,000 people per year &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0.000 of the country &apos;s aux@@ iliary centres are rejected annually by the municipal centres , while the industry has taken on the effects of further reduction cuts on transactions already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three of five people - mostly elderly people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just Del@@ og@@ ations and the same - in their search for free legal advice and legal status . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already out@@ fitted , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June , next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal agents . &quot;
&quot; the Director of the Common Cent@@ res of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell , said that the last survey of the National Union of Municipal centres revealed that thousands of people will be rejected each year . &quot;
Far@@ rell said that the situation without raising the decision of the German government would only be worse .
&quot; Queens@@ bor@@ der@@ berry Cent@@ res are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning thousands of people from important services you need will be rejected , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ mistak@@ able and pres@@ sive debt , families who have been released by part@@ itions , workers who have problems righ@@ tly and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; by June 2017 , the Federal Government will reduce the funds by 30 percent , which means thousands of hel@@ pers needs to be forced from Queensland with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the General Prosecutor of the Federal Prosecutor and the Federal Government of Queensland George Bran@@ dis as well as sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis , so people get the help you need to receive legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled their commitment to raise funds for legal affairs on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now at the time to view the needs of communal centres and their customers , as well as the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work . &quot;

&quot; when he had agreed with Philli@@ p in the local and regional battle line , B@@ ordin@@ i established that at least four other people had the same experience with Philli@@ p , he was charged in the indictment . &quot;
weapons must not be fired to harm the harm . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation occurs only two days after the republi@@ can presidential candidate , as he said to a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; - should take action to take action if his rival of Hillary Clinton should be elected and judge . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign clearly stated that the media would have torn his words from the context and that he would not focus on violence .

Berlin / Schwerin : study survey on European elections : SPD and CDU
&quot; at the upcoming elections in the Federal State of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the gover@@ ning party SPD and CDU . &quot;
this was representative surveys of the opinion research institute ins@@ a for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition won almost further rule in the north , this is not possible according to exchange values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD , however , would have the strongest party and would have good chances to continue the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD top@@ pled from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent in five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CDU , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left hand came to 19 per cent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; despite a slight losses of 6 percent ( previously : 8.7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens came back into the heav@@ al day . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the country &apos;s day .
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ uties , the SPD &apos;s SPD would only be only 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CDU was only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; this was still standing behind the green with 19 per cent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
Af@@ D would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the House of Represent@@ atives .
&quot; at 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss out in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the followers today domin@@ ate the world - its producers experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather bold . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning eight meg@@ abytes , which would be today for about two sel@@ ects with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
&quot; the Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops , and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euro , lovers can buy the devices on the internet , but they origin@@ ate from the st@@ one@@ age of the internet . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had previously announced the product a couple of months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer trade fair in Hanover , Germany . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to use a lot : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax it was communic@@ ator . &quot;
even access to websites was possible via HTML @-@ browser if even qu@@ itting slowly .
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be similar to a laptop . &quot;
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; rather proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euro . &quot;
the average price for a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros .
no one could happen in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
&quot; the smart phones are a success story , although not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the mobile phone number of Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , the market is now the provider that all came much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; being online and always online , this is today for very many people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphones worldwide . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone , of which 5@@ 55 million units are sold . &quot;
&quot; the worldwide turnover , with around 400 billion euros , is around 400 billion euros . &quot;
the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications company are coming .
&quot; around the smartphone , a whole industry was created in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came first at the beginning of 2007 , then the Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on the Mac World &apos;s introduction to the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , phone and internet communications , all via touch @-@ screen easily to use . &quot;
&quot; the winner of the Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the thought . &quot;
&quot; they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the S@@ agen now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention a self @-@ comprehen@@ sion .
&quot; on average , every German now has 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we must all learn to go away the smartphone even times , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive board for personnel . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must draw the Olympic spirit and expand Heath@@ row
&quot; Heath@@ row is not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country renewal , and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction in Heath@@ row , just as at that time in 2012 , when we used a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
&quot; and that will come again , by creating new opportunities for local and companies nearby Heath@@ row . &quot;
&quot; for our local communities we will have 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces , creating 40,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they predicted in London 2012 , there will be such thing that the challenge of the expansion of Heath@@ row is too large . &quot;
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ze on the world stage .
the two @-@ fl@@ yers had in@@ justice in 2012 and they will be wrong with Heath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to over@@ pass , but Heath@@ row answers any question . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , Heath@@ row is for many and not for one infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to funny growth and have a legacy of skills and employment to leave the airport as well as in all the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in Heath@@ row , which has been made a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget , was chosen from the T5 - the five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequency @-@ test drive . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment . &quot;
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we turn up this Olympic spirit and expand Heath@@ row as well as our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England .

ad@@ block Plus and Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and Maus@@ oleum &quot; on display block
&quot; according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to handle display blocking , a &quot; Cat@@ z@@ - and Maus@@ oleum &quot; is equal to businesses . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook , ad@@ block Plus would block it to block on his desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a Blo@@ g@@ post where users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook talked with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the encoding concerning his advertis@@ ements to identify the indication of the advertis@@ ers which is part of the page advertising . &quot;
but ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
&quot; in a Blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this type H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle has been underway in the inv@@ ading Open Source community and the conver@@ ters since the invention of advertis@@ ers in progress , &quot; and that it is possible to see Facebook soon with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left social media in the struggle , is a strong indi@@ gest@@ ion that has become a wor@@ r@@ ying sco@@ op for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study conducted by Pa@@ der@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people are used worldwide according to a study by Pa@@ der@@ air and Adobe ; almost four times as much in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users active users who access Facebook on their mobile devices , hand advertising is 84 percent of advertising revenues . &quot;
&quot; the company has no effect on display block@@ ers on desktop PCs , because mobile ad @-@ block@@ ers have no effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of revenues , such as Facebook appears to be worth it as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook told that it would update its &quot; &quot; ad pre@@ ference &quot; &quot; to have more control over them to have targeted advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blo@@ c would be wor@@ r@@ ying new filters because they were also blocking the content on the side , which are no advertis@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; the user does not represent a positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , &quot; shared a spokes@@ man of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , so why we have focused on developing tools such as ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman with suspected suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police call witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours of Thursday , after a susp@@ icious suicide of several vehicles on a motorway . &quot;
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss age in the age of 49 , which was over@@ driven by several vehicles , including a truck car , was wanted to kill themselves . &quot;
she died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , the police said these , as well as witnesses of the incident , to report themselves . &quot;
&quot; an investigation was opened , which was an &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter divided the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be waiting if one of the drivers are displayed . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash to be avoided ?
&quot; that is something what the prosecutor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers do not move to responsibility .
&quot; in each of the two cases - where one person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that the drivers do not need to go out in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year a police officer acquitted of the negli@@ gence , after having crossed a man and had killed one night on the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and became un@@ conscious in the street . &quot;
&quot; the court noted that the police had answered -- on a justified way -- on a justified way , that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; completely exceptional and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
everyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should be noti@@ fied by the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once resi@@ li@@ ent
the Venus was probably inhab@@ itable according to the projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate model .
&quot; scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies , NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorith@@ ms , similar to those of climate resear@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus and its hot , water @-@ free surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could once have been recorded . &quot;
scientists have previously noted that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere , and still turned out slowly . &quot;
the model lit up the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet is believed to be more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to host life and protected from qu@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the early Venus benef@@ ited from a sun , which was 30 per cent . &quot;
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus is exp@@ on@@ ated its daily page of the Sun almost two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io , in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds that seems like an umbrella , in order to hold the surface of most of the sun @-@ heat . &quot;
&quot; the result are average temperatures , which are a few degrees cooler than the Earth today . &quot;
&quot; the model brought out a history of Venus , which resem@@ bles evolution that was suspected before Planet@@ en@@ ce@@ ern . &quot;
&quot; although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billion years , --@@ too much heat and ultra@@ violet light was exposed . &quot;
their oceans are dar@@ ling and their water vap@@ or was burnt away from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their Hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which , as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate change at Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy is back as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
&quot; on Thursday , Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and vice president of Hockey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a low participation in decision of the team . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and realized that the club will immediately search for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the last three years , I have filled my duties as chief manager and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of summer long and much more thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , it needs and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice president Of Hockey Operations has to be perfectly matched to the organisation . &quot;
he also has to have a co @-@ determination of decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , presented himself with him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me this decision today , &quot; &quot; Sak@@ ic said . &quot;
we appreciate all that he did for our organisation and wish him for the future only .
&quot; during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , Roy was awarded the Best Trainer of the League for Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 . &quot;
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota , and missed during each of the two last years . &quot;
the Aval@@ on Board in the 2015 @-@ 16 season a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the game for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference to return five points .
&quot; as the Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Canadi@@ en and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ labor@@ ers return conversations , put on strike &quot;
&quot; the workers are exposed to the wages for North overseas workers , while all the parties are preparing for a new talk of discussion on the table , said negoti@@ ator . &quot;
strikes against the oil field provider Wood Group were spor@@ adic@@ ally conducted on platforms in the North Sea which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group , as well as the un@@ ites and r@@ ashes of trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re@@ united with the conclu@@ ding process of the current battle , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
we will hold some full day sessions in the coming weeks that will start to start the problems at the beginning of the next year .
&quot; the unions had said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has reduced the rates to its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s credit card follows a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the companies have the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has announced for his part of thousands of people and plans to release their oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as a result of its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ us@@ ement recei@@ pts with the British energy company BG Group ration@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; due to lower crude oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation that led to the European Union &apos;s decision in June to intensi@@ fy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish par@@ liam@@ ent@@ ator Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week , with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the largest labour force since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need a economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion spending will be expected for new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of approximately $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the constellation of the Ple@@ j@@ aden
&quot; the latest mission with the Kepler &apos;s space teles@@ cope , astronom@@ ers have helped to collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates below the stars of the cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the stars are rotating at different rates , as well as related to the operating periods of the planet . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through the same our results with other star shows , learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the story of his solar system , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ aden lies 4@@ 45 light years from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this constellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they now turn fastest .
&quot; to top rotating rates , these att@@ acking stars are star@@ ring large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is sha@@ ken , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Kepler measures the rotation rate of any star by playing the time between the appearance of an recogni@@ zable star in@@ fle@@ cks -- as sun@@ spots -- recognis@@ es .
&quot; the latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that massive stars are slower than less massive stars . &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ aden we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , while the faster rot@@ ors tend to be more bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star@@ ring of the Ple@@ j@@ aden is so close , it serves as an ideal kos@@ her laboratory to compare its qualities such as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ ring of the Ple@@ j@@ aden offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar press in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; a lot before we would like to learn more about how the How , When and Why stars are slow down their rot@@ ational gu@@ itars and hang up their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotary gu@@ ins of the Ple@@ j@@ aden which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star
tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional return date , the 41 year @-@ old professional will carry out the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; , &quot; stated the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
his signature in a ten year @-@ year contract gave him a total of 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; by the end of the contra@@ diction on December 31 , 2017 , he served as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Navy ( 1994 @-@ 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall of Fame , H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show another two bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics . &quot;
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old can &apos;t be taken up in the bas@@ eball hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field was so controversial his appearance outside of the square .
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star performed at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked up to 211 games due to a processing in the so @-@ called bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is considered as the principal susp@@ ect for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a legal dispute , the lock has been reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the league could even have done to me for the year 2014 , because I played a break for 20 years without a break , Rodri@@ guez told me at that time . &quot;
his deportation days are not no@@ isy .
&quot; during many bas@@ eball legends in their last games , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench . &quot;

&quot; Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa and Adrian Ziel@@ insky are first d@@ oping cases &quot;
wi@@ red : because of a positive d@@ oping sample weigh@@ t@@ the@@ ber may not start with Adrian Ziel@@ insky from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be overs@@ ha@@ do@@ wed by the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ es .
an experienced athl@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ cases have become known in Rio de Janeiro in front of the seventh competition .
&quot; Chinese swimming pool in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ steep@@ le ch@@ ase in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight of Adrian Ziel@@ inski in Brazil were positively tested and excluded - just before the start of the pre @-@ critical athle@@ tics competitions this news is coming to the accident . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been detected , which is used as a m@@ asked drug for d@@ oping substance . &quot;
the International Sport@@ court CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon at the time of the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds , they missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part in the fo@@ oth@@ ills about 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , Ch@@ en has applied the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing . &quot;
&quot; National Association take the matter &quot; very seriously and requires Ch@@ en full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work together with the International Sport@@ court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history is no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S responsible for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also during the night of Rio , the news spread over the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa , which 33 @-@ year @-@ old went himself into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be a dietary supplement , &quot; stated the female athl@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is supposed to act with the banned substance of the EP@@ O blood . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa was provision@@ ally suspended , according to the B@@ NT , the B @-@ Trial should already be positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow returned immediately with criticism against the right of the Ath@@ let@@ es .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t get the right loops , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; We Bulg@@ arians standing under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; so , approximately all weight plates from the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ing@@ ed nation cannot be held in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ insky , &quot; the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg was also tested positive on the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both are taking the in@@ gest@@ ion , however , both must not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa &apos;s case is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sports . &quot;
&quot; the world federation IA@@ AF had the entire Russian team until an exception of systematic D@@ op@@ ings to the start , also the stag@@ nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the bu@@ oy@@ ancy chamber , the former expul@@ sion in China had also triumph@@ ed between athletes as well . &quot;
so the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympics Champion Sun Yang hard .
&quot; sun yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass over me , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun stood at the heart of a meditation on the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping bet@@ rü@@ ger , &quot; this said . &quot;
&quot; on the Chinese championships in 2014 , Sun was positive on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit on a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
dat@@ kl@@ au : as per@@ fi@@ de @-@ pressing h@@ acker their rans@@ om
programm@@ ers of erotic malware use targeted companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed firms in the past twelve months were at least once , partially several victims of a attack with compres@@ sors software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already been the aim of a Ran@@ som@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; 40 per cent of the victims were willing to use the requested del@@ etes , to be able to use the requested systems and data . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their compres@@ sors software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in company network .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential savings account is considerably higher than private use . &quot;
&quot; we currently watch a sc@@ ary fast evolution of damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertis@@ ements . &quot;
then the perpet@@ rators discovered the press software for itself .
&quot; only private users were the goal , but the change to corporate attack took place in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware is working after a simple pattern : once on the computer of an Op@@ ter , you are looking for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als lasting .
the software then presents the demands of the compres@@ sors .
&quot; in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims must have money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ ole Bit@@ coin - . &quot;
&quot; but where private uses the personal photo database on the game , it goes to companies around sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage falls below if a Ran@@ som@@ ites hits . &quot;
&quot; 22 per cent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by Ran@@ som@@ ites , 13 percent even had to complete business activities , in case of a case in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened with loss of nur@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , it encour@@ ages only the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 per cent of companies that pay , get their dates back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject with stand@@ still the demand of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know that and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the scientists from F @-@ Secure exam@@ ines the user interfaces and contact with the compres@@ sors and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain to their victims by chat , as they can pay by bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ ted for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and , individuals who have redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to pay hard and rep@@ aid five digit sum@@ s to re@@ turn@@ out their data . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ites de@@ press@@ way , h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski by antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; one single person can write a Ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; it is more likely , however , that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programm@@ ers sell their malware software in the form of a software building material to the actual compres@@ sors .
&quot; the previous malware kit was created by the malware itself , advice and additional tools for one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars were bought . &quot;
&quot; delivery includes a adjustment tool that can be changed smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the w@@ press@@ ors are looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log in one of the forums on the underground , buy the set of a criminal and t@@ asked another that software allows to install the software on many PCs . &quot;
the payment is done annually .
&quot; usually the crimin@@ als apply sp@@ ammer on spreading , &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known with many companies that secure their data better .
more than 50 percent of companies responsible for companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes study rely on Ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already following new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful enlighten@@ ment , the perpet@@ rators are instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this is the potential for damages according to type of data , even higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rators can also take completely new targets on the Internet of the grain . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstrate security scientists , as they have been connected to the Internet @-@ connected thermo@@ stat under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the br@@ otherhood of such a block@@ age could certainly be worth a rans@@ om . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ rators are then blocking a whole production road instead of the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday use .
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and even the vers@@ atility of a min@@ iv@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; rather persu@@ aded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually proved very flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , passengers have both in the first row as well as in the rear , it works closely closely . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the inside are well processed and seem pleasant , just the cockpit @-@ top is falling there . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V at the storage space .
&quot; it is not only a trunk for 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ speed and 10@@ 26 l near back@@ rest , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , than it sounds : the seating faces of the rear bench can be set up as the chin chair up and offer a storage space , which is high from the ground up to the ceiling 1.@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , however , the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 . &quot;
&quot; the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp , acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges . &quot;
&quot; however , he should do something qui@@ eter in a little qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine capacity : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a bit direct .
the equipment in the tested top model &quot; Executive &quot; is not desired to be desired .
&quot; to security systems , the city emergency braking assistance is one ( working up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the track support assistant . &quot;
sometimes the coll@@ ision warning sometimes irrit@@ ated because he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; her@@ an@@ nah@@ ende objects . &quot;
very reliable works by remote @-@ light assist@@ ent .
and the intelligent speed control re@@ acts to the traffic sign detection and dro@@ p@@ t when necessary .
&quot; but the full connectivity is available but only for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI jack lie below the arm@@ rest and are therefore a little bit to reach .
the roughly 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to invest in so much , the petrol engine will receive 20,000 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
air@@ line is not liable : fall to the passenger bridge
an air@@ line is not liable for the fall of a passenger car on the passenger bridge .
&quot; because a liability is conc@@ ei@@ vable only with dangers , which are typical for air traffic , argu@@ ed the Upper Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down with the fall of a knee .
&quot; however , the accident could happen everywhere - it is a common risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline had no compensation for damages .
disease : when paid the promot@@ er
&quot; after their journey , you will only get money back after their journey when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ ful in the hotel . &quot;
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the case a family was severe in severe diar@@ rhoea and vomiting in the second day of its Turkish invasion .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective cl@@ ots which allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
&quot; the family was the view , the journey would have been in@@ sufficient - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er . &quot;
&quot; before the court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; the cl@@ ot@@ ion situation , indeed , was defective . &quot;
but the organizers just knew before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out until then that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the judgment . &quot;
no imp@@ ur@@ ities found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ red by infection - belong to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 dise@@ ased .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said after refugees committed to refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people are worried about the attacks . &quot;
the State must respond to terrorist attack and decided to react to terrorist attack .
safe is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators not with hatred and split .
we will not g@@ onna do this triumph .
&quot; if the off@@ ender had to leave the country fast , this increases the safety and strength of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to implement the proposals for the 2017 German Parliament election .
&quot; he also announced another personalized rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; in a medium @-@ sized magn@@ itude over several years . &quot;
Symp@@ ath@@ ered advertising for terrorism must be under punishment again .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the weapon law is calculated that especially the purchase of weapons on the Internet is worth it . &quot;
&quot; the most recently discussed sweat , for doctors said to remain in words according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères . &quot;
&quot; however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession as the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with a view of psych@@ ic ab@@ normal@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister maintains a better social service . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mat@@ ised men .
for the prosecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of an investig@@ ator .
&quot; the SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contributes to further increase the security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior clearly stated against action of action .
&quot; that was a ear@@ nest for the sni@@ pes in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected the Union from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of the double citizenship earlier .
a general ban on completion of completion for constitutional problems he is constitu@@ tionally problem@@ atic .
&quot; one can not offer anything , which one re@@ jects , and I rest the trace of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
they could speak about rules about traffic or witnesses before the court .
green @-@ Che@@ fin Simone Peter designed the Minister to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror p@@ act and action .
&quot; the left @-@ wing party leader Bernd Rie@@ x@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; PRO@@ VER@@ BS and a tigh@@ tening of the residence permit humans in this country no longer security . &quot;
better transport flow on the motorway exit
it is seen regularly on the road road - here is a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal de@@ fle@@ ur should be extended .
&quot; this is a good news for all the car @-@ drivers who stand in the traffic road every night in the bar , when they drive over the highway A@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the road building has been extended to the area between the Hammer Road and Wednesday , 16 August ( 16 @-@ 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the departure road to 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then go right from the hammer street right .
&quot; the great advantage : the traffic divi@@ des itself early , whereby the total target is improved on the versatile section of the Federal Road 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea with the prolonged exit had the CDU faction in the Province of Münster @-@ West , Germany . &quot;
driving the driver on the crum@@ bs nervous the motor@@ ists above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; week@@ days goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ gan@@ ce path , and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
this is why the N@@ adel@@ ö@@ hr is located on the B 51 shortly before departure .
&quot; from here , traffic is only one @-@ track across the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second trace had to be built in a few years ago .
the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge does not have the required load capacity to absorb the heavy duty .
&quot; however , how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and that is going to be associated with con@@ gest@@ ion , the state department can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to count : for the bridge has an official residual period up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal de@@ fle@@ ur , the country operation has deliberately sought out the traffic less@@ er time in school holidays because with disabilities . &quot;
traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday on Wednesday .
Inter@@ cultural Journey : cultural Off@@ ers for Schools

rain instead of shooting stars : hope in weather repair
the weather has taken the shooting stars in the southwest of Germany in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday - but there are still hope .
&quot; the night was not suitable for clouds and rain to observe the Himm@@ els@@ spectac@@ le , said the chairman of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night for Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; among the shooting stars it is Per@@ pet@@ den who , with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour , are among the fastest star@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they apparently come from the constellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which goes into the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , you should live etern@@ ally , at night it is awake for hours , in the morning there is no longer to think of sleep in the morning . &quot;
that is all other than relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep frequent or permanent . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be multiple causes of sleep , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the German Society for sleeping and sleep medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you understand in , is the In@@ som@@ nie , so an entry and the sleep disorder . &quot;
&quot; many people are straight away as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ n@@ ne@@ cht says the member of the German Haus@@ er Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep problems are complex .
&quot; organic , mental or waste @-@ related factors , but also medications are stuck behind . &quot;
not rare is the sleep expression of another disease .
&quot; very early wake @-@ up is particularly frequent in an depression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot;
and it can be that various factors would like to thank each other .
&quot; who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , w@@ akes up every two to three hours , and may be bl@@ ur@@ red on more than everyday problems and worry , there are We@@ e@@ ß an example . &quot;
&quot; that leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should one sleep with sleep problems ?
&quot; if you sleep over a period of a month in at least three nights a week , if not sleep well and the day should be imp@@ aired , he should betra@@ y We@@ e@@ ß . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment can look completely different : one is sm@@ itten , tired , untreated , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood changes or physical problems such as stomach or heada@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; to relie@@ ve the sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; among other things , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy , or also medications - classical sleep tablets are only in exceptional case and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ esch , head of the inter@@ disciplinary sleep medical center of the Char@@ ité University Hospital Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , at sleep problems , you should not turn to the home doctor , advis@@ es We@@ e@@ ß . &quot;
anyone can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who was going to sleep , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for example , in a sleep laboratory , medical examination rates , for example in snor@@ ing with respiratory failure , if you don &apos;t find the cause of sleep disorder or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleep@@ y disorder , explains fi@@ xation . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; just please do not make a nap , &quot; says Fi@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; after c@@ abling , one goes into bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des in the body , one is wearing nose s@@ ungl@@ asses , a chest strap and a fe@@ el@@ ty on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera is mounted on the ceiling to the ceiling . &quot;
how can people get the problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of screws where you can apply for a better sleep .
&quot; We@@ e@@ ß is on : regular sleep and stand @-@ up times , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep television to sleep , avoid drinking alcohol and watch out at night - then you start to count immediately , and that &apos;s quite and not enough . &quot;
what the Jungle camp with missing medals in the swimming pool
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appo@@ inting the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he brought gold for the first time in Doha , and presented his first world record at the same time . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has protected his ex @-@ team @-@ mate &apos;s criticism via Facebook . &quot;
&quot; in a country where a Olympic champion gets 20,000 € premi@@ ums and a Dsch@@ ed@@ el@@ kö@@ nig 150.000 € should no man think about lack of medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night on Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the support system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ oping control systems are very good . &quot;
&quot; thus , we cannot compete with countries who do so much and do not see it with D@@ oping the topic or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that here the controls are to be stopped , &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler needs to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how to keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled by the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A for a certain period of WM / OS , may not take part , &quot; says the choice ham@@ burger , who now operates an ice@@ berg . &quot;

&quot; compared to a Li@@ dl , who will soon be demolished soon , it is already built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments are produced here . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; , &quot; as the responsible property company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in is called Friedrich@@ sha@@ in , in recent weeks , however , pre@@ fers with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents of the residents , on the ground floor , are still occupied spaces and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , it has been several times since the beginning of the year a tough task of police against the project , called the &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers were cleared , pat@@ rou@@ ded the police three weeks ago with 30 to 40 officers and three club cars on the spot , locked parts of the road and kept visitors to enter the house with number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile building workers in order of unknown household owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later moved police and builders under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road acts peace@@ fully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking ahead of late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the hood , a primary school and nursery schools are located . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many people : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who gener@@ alizes three children , are gener@@ ously generated by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the Hau@@ spro@@ ut , they share the concern of increasing ten@@ dencies and cent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t sound like a ja@@ z who wanted to present a majority of police protection from the v@@ ans left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin &apos;s Inn@@ u@@ en@@ ator and the police make up their neighbours , obviously not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the East of Berlin@@ s was actually a traditional labor district , which today , compared to the rest of the city , a lower average income and poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied by the former DDR ( former DDR ) and the native residential projects , including almost the whole mainstre@@ am street near the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; during the Main@@ zer , under a large police unit , many of the projects were leg@@ alised in the Rig@@ a@@ er , and are still inhabited by the people that they had occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly dedicated to the mag@@ nets for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world : with them the residents of GDR &apos;s times and former car@@ av@@ ans share their Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; this makes itself noticeable at the Mi@@ etes , which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the re@@ constructions in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them in designed disks , or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were thrown with paint bags . &quot;
no other street was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous power . &quot;
&quot; a reason for this , that not all neighbours have seen this as a problem , could not be concerned that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body viol@@ ating statistics , according to statistics , are almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the largest part of the off@@ ender make non@@ damage caused , probably the re @-@ built and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the disputed 94 , cannot be speech of un@@ certainty . &quot;
&quot; in terms of violence , they appe@@ aled : people in the 94 are their neighbours , which are not the determined . &quot;
even the famous burning cars give it straight in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
&quot; for studying architecture , her street is not a criminal purpose , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and get more apart , than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consci@@ ously drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er road - and remained .
&quot; therefore , it was so important that the natives have returned their street : from the police , politics and the media , who suddenly claimed the interpretation of the districts in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take away : through sigh@@ ted new@@ buildings in former construction g@@ aps , which pushing the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; this is what con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many here - here are people who are not so well received , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not gu@@ ar@@ theid . &quot;
&quot; but what to do , if any man listen to anyone ? &quot;
&quot; the fru@@ stration was placed on all sides , also with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the or@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who draws up , should be aware of it - just like someone who draws in a bar in a pub , there can be badly compl@@ ain about noise . &quot;
&quot; all persons present with fore@@ names were asked to be called , not named with their right name &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in the integration and organizer .
&quot; in addition , she is a social worker . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee authority for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the team of administration to Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; it sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , labor group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else can be joined . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine client from the working group indicates that the volunteer has more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ ks@@ au that has a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less mo@@ cked than rather on the multitude of desired task areas - meant as the management wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; we were looking for an administrative service with a talent for languages and people connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , an ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ ks@@ au . &quot;
&quot; administrative labour is not their central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; especially we go to organization , work with people on @-@ site and even behind the scenes , as well as net@@ work@@ ings . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been running for approximately six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent spot for three years .
&quot; it was highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ en- and General stakeholders . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon new containers are available in the Was@@ enstraße
a serious problem has been recognized since some time to find apartments for the connection of the connection of the connection .
&quot; for the connection , the municipalities are responsible . &quot;
you must under@@ take the refugees in own or rented homes .
&quot; the costs for building , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry out the municipalities itself . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the land Council and the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects but not every land@@ lord wants to offer its apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; de facto , the administration is no private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it &apos;s not working yet to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , public apartments have to be revealed , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are placed in the Was@@ enstraße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed stay there are intern@@ ships , training courses , school places , a @-@ euro jobs and extermination activities for refugees and migrants who have to be moved or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places were good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building or help house@@ master , do not do @-@ profit work - and that &apos;s motivated and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that work leads to a positive effect on the community .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but he does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a rig@@ orous sense .
&quot; so , there are offers such as sport , contacts with loc@@ als and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so you also jump to administration and volunteer .
&quot; it is central , that the refugees get the feeling that they would be desired in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they need to declare the refugees that it is , and they can make it useful for the time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; whoever feels like , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , you could not work and be un@@ profitable , who will never integrate . &quot;
the distinct majority is motivated .
&quot; but there is also , says the customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people , where nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : did the two have been afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer can clearly show &quot; what man@@ cher na@@ i@@ v &quot; may call . &quot; a rest@@ less@@ ness could not exclu@@ de it . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are sensiti@@ zed .
these incid@@ ents were also subject to refugees .
they would have fear that the attacks them to bring them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary positions must be kept in the area and in the region after activities .
&quot; they always have in the background , that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a limit ?
this question clearly answer to answer the policy .
actually it is un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived there where we would like , &quot; &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher can also be out@@ fitted , the previous people are reasonable . &quot;
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but if people are in need , they have to help them , both women are lon@@ ely . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers . &quot;
chim@@ ney : objec@@ tor with Hel@@ icop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew several areas around one hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men arrived on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 am for@@ mid@@ able in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the lin@@ den@@ weg path .
the occup@@ ants surprised the two and struck the un@@ fair in the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters tall , probably m@@ asked , carried both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black ho@@ o@@ lics . &quot;
they fled towards downtown .
the police set the police several stri@@ kers and a police helicopter .
&quot; without success , the F@@ ahn@@ ging went without success . &quot;
&quot; perhaps , the unknown disaster fell close to the apartment or in their run . &quot;
