<seg id="2">"investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - that, both Clinton and Trump."</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential elections, however, are one of the control and energy policy as well as in a basic question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton lies a fundamental, more philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">That is about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Trump wants to keep the doubt rather small in doubt and warns against the state of the economy, with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to export the economy to death, and regulate to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it himself would be quite different, claiming Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will return regulators massively, and he makes itself strong tax reform with lower tax rates - for private professionals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, however, says: the State has certain tasks to be fulfilled, he has opened its privileged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would be increased, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the needs to be invested, trump and Clinton say almost wortely."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic Candidate announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state-critical tea wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so, on Trump, there might be still partitioning internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">More significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and cross the coal extraction in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in so far-protected areas to terminate the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in contrast, Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies with its investment program:" a country will create the superpower of the clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">"PP, the SPP-fish trade agreement, they don't want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the US would not want to isolate from international trade - but just to protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid even better. Clinton demands.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger-wage. "</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what is to do in this question isn't quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rushed, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the control policy of both bearings.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on one side is trump, who wants to stimulate the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics keep it before, so the budget deficit would only be bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Clinton who wants to demand more taxes on the other hand, that they will pay more taxes, and their critics say," more taxes are not the solution. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence is one of women who flee alone, almost daily life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"if arriving in Germany, they are often traumatised."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at most a year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He guesses with great eyes curious in the space.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother is fixing on the table.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they notice that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it is area manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social relief offers in Bavaria, and deals with the topic women on the escape."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are winged.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralized women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs made the establishment with Pro Familia and the Munich's Aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no - but not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a watchman at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated: every woman who comes here has made experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted because they send torture or death or because their families send them as an hope in Europe," she tells. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women there were no other reasons for the escape:" many steal themselves secretly, because they don't see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experienced experience with sexual violence, forced, honourable, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, that goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, the tugs demand a sexual action for example, is no rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who think that the end, once they arrived in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"even here, women in refugee are often regarded as minimally considered and worst is abused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that about 90 per cent of women who live in the Munich area, are traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not entirely voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women were so used to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about life, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often do not help to help themselves, it simply need more accommodations for them, calls Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they wishing from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some say with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is something in accomodations of the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Schwaben alone, women are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the press review of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in some cases, in Oberbayern, accommodation and medium-sized houses, there are only two floors or their own houses for single-standing women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodation exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "rights of women and gender equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men separately.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published by the Committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are separated from separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy or men are accommodated together, men and women can be accommodated - violence against women are coming."</seg>
<seg id="46">"especially the shower room should be separated, and be easily accessible to women, stands in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this protection needs, you can read the Andalablesen, which there is in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we talked about that there is us, we have a long queue," says Bahr. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of foreign side"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up his hands and an official end of the eight months of war in the words of words and economic sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but as Vladimir Putin, his Turkish counterplayer in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palastes takes place in the reception, I cannot tolerate this reconciliation in most reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was no charge, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile was very narrow, and he hardly screwed heat, even for his restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said," "dear friend" "- according to a report whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before crisis, but even better."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as it would never happen."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable chasing showed that the Russian leader of Russia had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his execution: the surplus of a Russian fighter planes sent to the Syrian border by Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was wutenting.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared Ankara and accused Ankara to be back in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it was even bigger, as it was celebrated by a thought-out friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Vetrauen is going to build up again if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, nationally controlled media led a hefty, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"once again, it seemed to be the Turks to blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious, the allegations of leading officers, that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting was held only because Putin received the excuse of the President Erdogan who wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the benefits of an armistice are clear."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan is the first line of all friends that he can get, after the last month after a failed coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="28">He repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They are located on a late seasonal onslaught of the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television projected fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in this way, a report in Vedemosti formulated it like this:" tourists there long, tomatoes here for long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is furious on the west, since its reaction to the attempted power of power was considered a weak answer."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the persisting Groll come across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike it is to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, Russian Chief of State won a bonus for ensuring that he urged the attempted coup d" état to the elected State of State. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"that is, for Moscow, a self-understandable, that even a profound fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glorious palace, made by Russia and Turkey, one of how it once described an analyst," Alliance of foreign side "represented: two countries who have contracted from the West and are badly treated."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria where Moscow has recently joined the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey can support each other."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it might be indicative that after almost three hours of first call on the press conference, both presidents were held on the press conference, that they didn't even striped the theme."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey missed it on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">"there is no unique consensus about it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, as NATO member Turkey enjoyed the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better to talk about two leaders at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "acting concept" for the next rating of advice.</seg>
<seg id="5">But strife is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">The first line is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Christoph Bratmann, President of the SPD:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build urban areas in future 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the favourable apartments, however, can also arise."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the large part of the town hall was, however, Bratmann:" how are you going to build up private areas with investors? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 per cent, but as possible as 20 per cent of the apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban construction program that will cost millions of costs and will be financed even for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem so Bratmann: "there are currently no agreement between the fractions.</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to keep investors as low as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left will still want hardness for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of what, Bratmann, bathe on a tightening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the concept concept is implemented, which will ensure additional tasks in the building management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program isn't yet completely: because the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how does one compare the loss of another 1,300 favorable flats, which will expire in the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, the planned spokesperson on Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the town."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, this would have to be thought to bring apartments back into the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western town.</seg>
<seg id="26">Upon a blow the problem could solve.</seg>
<seg id="27">"because in the west city, there is the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back into the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners to do housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the western city has been drastically increased, it is removed from the target of the so-called mixture."</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of social guards in only a few neighbourhoods shall no longer give.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler withdrew his immune system and lamineflex of a serious testing - he relured some of the dirty and most frequent places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scrapped his course on a Euro-scraper, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a washing knob of an access toilet and a public telephone in Russia to make the resistance of his immune system under proof."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in front of every object, he used a luminance to show and show us what he will be attached."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results in daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, the washing-knob of a drawbacks, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely impervious, but in fact they are in a kitchen sultry more poor bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of Darmbacia and about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"luckily, nothing left what he refused, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestine, as he travelled through the world and ate great things and wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations, up to washing buttons from toilets, the task posed his immune system definitely under a sample."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" already as a child I was relatively unworried what my health concern and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was righteous in his call."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused to be a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His profiling was showing a luminometer of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in comparison, the Luminometric hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse, after their Luminometric dose was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have a little less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the bacterials in different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," This is the worst thing I have smoked in a toilet, close. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm going to do nothing here because it is drillful here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers really something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating and also explains the advantages of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy Brainstormings that ended with that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">Do you claim that interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to ask them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumption of more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film's direction, added:" let me say, "" I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had made some of the things that I have relied on him, like the eclectic Russian toilet which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things that it was easier to bring Ian to bring them and others, where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm happy that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in one of the validvalidation survey conducted by 2015, 84 percent of respondents agreed to include lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent, that they contain at least occasionally products used to contain mitactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partners say to all that?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation.</seg>

<seg id="14">The fact that Germany does not have to implement multiple EU requirements for passenger data and weapons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call to more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as part of the year, de Maizière starts a second stop for proposals that have not been made with the SPD so far: he wants to set sympathizations for terrorist groups, with double citizenship to the German passport."</seg>

<seg id="24">It also works inbalanced and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the inequality of thought of thought for example - the question arises: what does it mean to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be noted that the attacks of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people were worried about the high refugee numbers."</seg>

<seg id="37">"only a garriser controversy over the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a safest policy collection of some Unions Interior Minister, where the Ressorts also demand a Burka ban and demand a return from the double citizenship."</seg>

<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely casual group.</seg>
<seg id="7">"it is also not a hordes by hobbyists - it has an emotional meaning: older platform runners retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend time alone (69% vs. 66%)."</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of Yougov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera during the midst of a bustling road in Soho, a modest gray suit and wild before I stand before I stand, my hands hold and something like this:" "so let's take a close look."</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's throw a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart rate Sohos slowly immigrated to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once an independent seller have been based - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle age) into the Reckless Records (data: eight men mean age, one woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops in order to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed him home), dress up the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records, which he could not afford when they had appeared and once more items which he sold when he was young and plexed."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things, when I was probably a little too young, to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"it is true that those who buy records, rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">That is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he meets, meets the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and get to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"of the conversations, which I led, people generally accepted as part of their collection by 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom of the turnout of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica, to recognize that record transactions offers a soothing community of equality."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world, and want to withdraw from trusted sound pitch, from objects which will be able to watch over youth experiences."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">That's like a collector so and I think it's so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" flashes a staff from a flat stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who have purchased a record last month, they haven't heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a turntables that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of news report, I would probably look very concerned while passing through a stack to Bossa Nova Komilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three men of middle age) has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone first came here and said:" I have no turntables, but I would like to buy a radio record, so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a great percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musicastic."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the younger people, not older, who first cleave the first."</seg>
<seg id="44">"stopover, dedicated to the record panels almost a whole floor, has a blower audience than I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teens and women middle age."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above stores - Wild Beasts of latest synthesia and sexist pop instead of experimental jazz drills from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity in the customer."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks particularly lonely, but nail psychological traumas are hard to detectable, when one stands for about 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs for some minutes in the shop and considered the variations of the panels for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window manneak as a wholesale buy.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve much, therefore the collecting records are not real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other way but the beauty of the plates is... it drives with a dearest sighs.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"as I admit that the jeans-Hotpants, I observe a group of young girls who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Crosley Record Players."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees her - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to deal with them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering the fact that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry, and some customers could send in the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is the one that gives most for luxurious items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my researches revealed that the results of YouGov vote, they leave at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers exist in reality, record shops and in Onlineforts."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they don't spend their Thursday morning with safety by record transactions of Berwick Street and the leaves through the sheets, while they avoid the rigid view of an uncanny, 30 year old false moderator, who rises above the shoulders of a middle age."</seg>

<seg id="2">"wherever you are, too late, it's the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro feel continuous and indifferent, a shaving relay between competition and Streets."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is like the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is used by the wristbands for the Turner's triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't switch on television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the queue, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, could possibly be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being-TV advertising when he would be a swimmers, Turner, or even Freal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting with gold in the Olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, some in the shade there are sports that are not generally accepted: airgun shoot, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breastswim and may reign for long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make a modest arguments in my particular darling, then leave me attention to the discrete charm of the trolins."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trolinjump already has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was the last 16 years that many things I had questioned, did not know that there is a Olympic portart."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"even though the United States sent athletes to be competition, there has never won a medal in the trampolinjump and had won a athlete until 2012."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for men and the Chinese and Canadians to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal in London.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampolinjump has a certain exterior chartered, partly because it sounds for the unexplained ear-fitting for a clownsschool as those who sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert but only a bound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonical tremors of his never to end, but also the Grazie of the Turnens and Tauern, which combines two sports that is essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means a lot like" jumping board. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"jump winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must land a number of falling movements (turning, Hgenuine and Saltos) before landing at the feet."</seg>

<seg id="26">"medallists hoping to continue in their quest for gold, faster, upward and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and back, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they do not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall, but also in television broadcast another hellish goal: the world or the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the targeted strewing is nobel, admired, even fanatic - and it is enough to touch even a spectator."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel like watching this games as a bit more fatigue.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses say that fourty Protestants were killed during clashes with police in firearms.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid consortium with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and continued more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people fell on roads and requested fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's answer was non-merciful."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot dead unarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"still in circulation videos on protests, which are probably from the last or early of this year, show how safety skin young people are forced to beat, while these were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights now demands a further investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country and future will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services works closely with the Ethiopians, to fight terrorism beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy is expanding its remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new endanger in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"roads are generally quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously established the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents have been effectively transferred to silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile, or sent into prison, or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options, except protesting, breaks it out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation Protestant.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous appeals that cover everything from the ground-use until sausages in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a further critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions go along the border to Eritrea; a fight for these zacky, controversial line called in June hundreds of life."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts are afraid that separatist like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been more or less forced in recent years, could use turbulence and arm themselves again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the biting after years are exploding under the surface now.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopian people were able to communicate with the social media, as cheap Smartphones was more common and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, so many people can still communicate via internet proxies, hiding where they stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said that they were gathered for protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since Äonen, Amharas, who are mainly christened from ethnopsies of the predominantly Christian flood countries, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and in lowlands."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are involved in coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for around 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military, in the intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death in an unsealed illness in 2012 for 17 years, Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was viewed as tactical genius, a man who could think of corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that it was especially posing in it, to use early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special authorizations to make opponents and make it harmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing in this fundamental game," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopian Mountains, Mr. Hailemariam come from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he enjoys not the confidence of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a riot in 2005, after thousands of elections are protested by the government, according to analysts of the government, and then stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"while the following Razents were killed many protestants, even if it were less than in the last months, and that time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts, Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new endanger, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensive abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, Protestants attacked in Gondar, a amharian town, headed by Tigray, and hatred opposite the Tigray is always more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests the USA and other western allies bring in an independent position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenians via neighboring Somalia, even if she recently announced that she closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West wants to support democracy, he doesn't want to assemble his ally in a more volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin free migration."</seg>

<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then back as needed.</seg>

<seg id="9">"this lifestyle of loneliness, however, seems to be a sponsorship for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues will report in the journal" Science, "anyway, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," said Alexander Schilllein of the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in fact, the Evolutionsbiologist presumed that Greenland's stone is likely to become old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenlandhaie are hard to observe, after all, they live especially in the ice sea from Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because water temperatures prefer around six degrees Celsius, they appear on the surface usually only in the winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">"about the lifestyle of Greenlandhaie, researchers do not know little."</seg>

<seg id="18">"this sharks still make this sharks: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed up the jaw bones of a young polar bears."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt for sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and look cadaver looking down from higher water layers according to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland-sharks, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Spitsbergen from the depths of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 cm measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of animals, they analyzed with the Carbon-14 method the lens core of the sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this center of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks, which contained proteins will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth was therefore, after the early 1960s, when nuclear tests have caused major quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the course of 220 centimeters in length of the third tier, the lens core contained a low excess of carbon-14 out of the nuclear weapons, so it is likely to celebrate his 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>

<seg id="29">That Greenland-females can only get offspring when they are longer than four meters.</seg>
<seg id="30">The researchers were able to assign the length of the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters are probably on the threshold for sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenlandhaie is obviously at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live especially in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon top, was caught on Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures often the body of the animals live there on sparing flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So it rims later - and align slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, animals are often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">"as a result, the heat loss of a gram of mouse is much larger than the elephant."</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal is more dangerous and should focus on it as possible as many descendants as possible," explains the evolution of evolution. "</seg>

<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick after it stayed in March at the railway world championships in London, despite the return of Hoys only a modest sixth place."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time when Hindes appeared.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement a gap to close the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man with whom they stayed, when they saw potential in the scottos, which is now unfolding."</seg>

<seg id="15">The 23 year old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have placed an Olympic champion in the final round and defeats the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just amazing.</seg>

<seg id="44">The GB Team is leaving his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring an attempt to medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing, London and London became the expectations for Rio."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Drums played back in the background, so the resignation of the technical leader Shane Sutton, in April, nestled in the heart of sexism and moons, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one sees the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks like that the legendary reputation GBS, who has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>

<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus and its hot, water-free surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could once have been recorded."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously noted that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>

<seg id="7">The model lit up the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet is believed to be more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to host life and protected from quintment."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the early Venus benefited from a sun, which was 30 per cent."</seg>

<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that seems like an umbrella, in order to hold the surface of most of the sun-heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the result are average temperatures, which are a few degrees cooler than the Earth today."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model brought out a history of Venus, which resembles evolution that was suspected before Planetenceern."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of erotic malware use targeted companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of the malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed firms in the past twelve months were at least once, partially several victims of a attack with compressors software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the aim of a Ransomites."</seg>
<seg id="5">"40 per cent of the victims were willing to use the requested deletes, to be able to use the requested systems and data."</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their compressors software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks in company network.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential savings account is considerably higher than private use."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we currently watch a scary fast evolution of damage software," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most malwareprograms were still designed to send advertisements."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered the press software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the goal, but the change to corporate attack took place in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware is working after a simple pattern: once on the computer of an Opter, you are looking for unlong changed files such as Word-, excel- or database files, as well as archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the Ransomware and deletes the originals lasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the compressors.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must have money - mostly in the form of Cryptoole Bitcoin -."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private uses the personal photo database on the game, it goes to companies around sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage falls below if a Ransomites hits."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 per cent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by Ransomites, 13 percent even had to complete business activities, in case of a case in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened with loss of nurses."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: do not pay, it encourages only the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 per cent of companies that pay, get their dates back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject with standstill the demand of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the scientists from F-Secure examines the user interfaces and contact with the compressors and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain to their victims by chat, as they can pay by bitcoin, freely accessible support sites, or decrypted for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and, individuals who have redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to pay hard and repaid five digit sums to returnout their data."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomites depressway, hackers are always professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski by antivirus provider SOPHOS:" one single person can write a Ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"it is more likely, however, that it is about three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware software in the form of a software building material to the actual compressors.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware kit was created by the malware itself, advice and additional tools for one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars were bought."</seg>
<seg id="31">"delivery includes a adjustment tool that can be changed smaller configurations, appearance and branding," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The wpressors are looking for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so you log in one of the forums on the underground, buy the set of a criminal and tasked another that software allows to install the software on many PCs."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is done annually.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals apply spammer on spreading," explains Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known with many companies that secure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies responsible for companies in the Malwarebytes study rely on Ransomware by file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already following new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful enlightenment, the perpetrators are instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"this is the potential for damages according to type of data, even higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in future, the perpetrators can also take completely new targets on the Internet of the grain."</seg>
<seg id="43">"at the Hackerconference Defcon demonstrate security scientists, as they have been connected to the Internet-connected thermostat under their control."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of the winter, the brotherhood of such a blockage could certainly be worth a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators are then blocking a whole production road instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, you should live eternally, at night it is awake for hours, in the morning there is no longer to think of sleep in the morning."</seg>
<seg id="3">That is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep frequent or permanent."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be multiple causes of sleep, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society for sleeping and sleep medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what you understand in, is the Insomnie, so an entry and the sleep disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"many people are straight away as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagnnecht says the member of the German Hauser Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep problems are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"organic, mental or waste-related factors, but also medications are stuck behind."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleep expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early wake-up is particularly frequent in an depression," says Weeß. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors would like to thank each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a herniated disc, can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours, and may be blurred on more than everyday problems and worry, there are Weeß an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"that leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one sleep with sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="18">"if you sleep over a period of a month in at least three nights a week, if not sleep well and the day should be impaired, he should betray Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look completely different: one is smitten, tired, untreated, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood changes or physical problems such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"among other things, behavioural changes, a cognitive behavioral therapy, or also medications - classical sleep tablets are only in exceptional case and at most for two weeks - inquire."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fiesch, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of the Charité University Hospital Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, at sleep problems, you should not turn to the home doctor, advises Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="24">Anyone can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who was going to sleep, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, in a sleep laboratory, medical examination rates, for example in snoring with respiratory failure, if you don't find the cause of sleep disorder or if you don't find the cause of a sleepy disorder, explains fixation."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"just please do not make a nap," says Fifa. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after cabling, one goes into bed at his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes in the body, one is wearing nose sunglasses, a chest strap and a feelty on the finger."</seg>

<seg id="33">How can people get the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screws where you can apply for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Weeß is on: regular sleep and stand-up times, not too long in bed, don't sleep television to sleep, avoid drinking alcohol and watch out at night - then you start to count immediately, and that's quite and not enough."</seg>

<seg id="41">"it is central, that the refugees get the feeling that they would be desired in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they need to declare the refugees that it is, and they can make it useful for the time, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"whoever feels like, he could not work in Urbach, you could not work and be unprofitable, who will never integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there is also, says the customer honestly," people, where nothing goes. "the work of Deuschle and Customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: did the two have been afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine Customer can clearly show "what mancher naiv" may call. "a restlessness could not exclude it."</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are sensitized.</seg>

<seg id="52">They would have fear that the attacks them to bring them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary positions must be kept in the area and in the region after activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">"they always have in the background, that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clearly answer to answer the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived there where we would like," "Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher can also be outfitted, the previous people are reasonable."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but if people are in need, they have to help them, both women are lonely."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers."</seg>
