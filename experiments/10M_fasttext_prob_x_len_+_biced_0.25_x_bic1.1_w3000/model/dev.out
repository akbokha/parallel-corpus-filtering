Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly .
the two were wanted to move on the implementation of international agreement and Teheran to dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze measures in the Middle East .
&quot; in the meeting , however , it should also deal with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been curious since years .
Washington has critic@@ ised the constant sett@@ ling of Israel and turns Netanyahu rep@@ ays at the peace process .
&quot; through the deal struck by Obama , for the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two continued wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu has been invited to the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress which had been viewed as an aff@@ r@@ ont to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not pronounced with Obama , a meeting with regard to the forth@@ coming up@@ time election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in a emergency call , Professor , shot his friend shot &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Wil@@ ey spoke with a little h@@ itt@@ led voice of the police that he shot his friend and that the officials would have had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet little dog &quot; but still live and likely to be excited , and he said that the family contact of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; in the house , the officials found the bodies of Amy Pr@@ un@@ eat and a handwritten note , I didn &apos;t regret it , I loved it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman that ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that lamb , who had travelled into two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already travelled to 300 miles to the school grounds , where he has been shot and killed according to the police according to the police . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ sign@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Univers@@ itäts @-@ Staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
&quot; he said , Lamb didn &apos;t know the f@@ ate@@ ful call at some point after that . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life , when the police captured him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to raise up a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the doctors at the two ends of the state were published , as also what students and staff that knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but probably difficult teacher . &quot;
students reported that they were looking forward to his teaching .
&quot; the police at G@@ auti@@ er , where he died , said he did not have a history of violence or criminal record . &quot;
&quot; Lamb himself had mentioned a written book in a written book in which he shared the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both trained in the Department of Social Sciences and History , which comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations too problem@@ atic behavior .
&quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ aver , who blessed Lamb , said he was also a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes stated that he told him that he had told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; ever , Delta State University had asked the Delta State University for some reason and said that he had any health problem for reasons of health reasons . &quot;
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the most recent changes in the employment policy of the university means that the promotion , for the Lamb , had worked so hard , would provide no warranty for him as Assistant Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; Professor William La@@ For@@ ge said he got anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
those are questions that cannot answer the Lamb .
after the escape from the campus the police found later Lam@@ bs trail when he continued in Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as .
&quot; before he could be arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the entry .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , Lamb opened his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants . &quot;
he did his doctorate in ped@@ agog@@ y in spring .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends of girl@@ friends called him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Carla Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through joint friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool old guy , who tried several years to teach her guitar game . &quot;
he was then the sho@@ al of women back then .
&quot; all girls sh@@ atter@@ ed when he was there , &quot; &quot; Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Bran@@ don . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ un@@ bite were obviously together some time .
&quot; in the emergency call , &quot; I said &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house attached to a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ un@@ ition , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that she had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; it was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met &apos;s , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that lamb was interested in music and blues . &quot;
&quot; lamb met Pr@@ un@@ ition , as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail arrived two years ago in a summer fair . &quot;
later they played together with one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ un@@ bite was a nurse that worked for different companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak light bar close to G@@ auti@@ er said that he finished his guitar and harmon@@ ious gr@@ asp@@ ing night in front of a sp@@ icious audience . &quot;
there was no signs of anything that was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were on clean and che@@ ered together .
I mean they both had a good sense for j@@ ester .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester program and specialised in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
&quot; he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas , and was the president of his Brotherhood and the students @-@ committee . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State University in Cleveland , including teachers , staff , students and members of the municipality on a candle @-@ cerem@@ onies . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the vig@@ il , whilst the &quot; &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons are resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
it is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; Association Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans carried to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police said that lamb had shot the emergency after he had shot dead , and that lamb had said in his emergency call to himself as his wife , but there is no indication that the two has ever been married . &quot;
Toys R Us is planning to set less workers for Christmas season
&quot; Toys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees , as last year , but the toy and baby products retail@@ er says that he will give the currently working employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;

Michael J. Fox greeting his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is apart from me , and it becomes very clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for a very forth@@ coming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a sim@@ ulated couple and a length of distant from it , with the prin@@ cess of Wales on a date . &quot;

&quot; it is really , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; the greatest time travel film that has ever been filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinemas in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; ban Ki @-@ moon , Secretary @-@ General , says his reply to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; that lasted nearly five years , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss again calls on all parties , including the shared UN security council , to join himself and promote inclusive negotiations for the search of a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban on Wednesday at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five standing member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the Annual General Assembly , in order to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he has regre@@ t@@ ted that the insur@@ rec@@ tions in the Council and in the Syrian people and regional powers make this situation ir@@ resol@@ vable .
&quot; in the ban of the crisis in Syria , Ban invited five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity which they proved to have proven a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 responses reflecting that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try , Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper edges in p@@ olls to draw down , it doesn &apos;t work yet . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the two @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask themselves seriously , which means that it means the chances of nomin@@ ation of real estate business . &quot;
of course it &apos;s too early in the election period .
nobody states that Tr@@ ump will probably win the republi@@ can nomin@@ ation .
experts have emphas@@ ized that this time Rick Per@@ r@@ ys lead to the Rising Herman Cain , from which none of them won just one state in the face process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside bands like Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize tr@@ um@@ ps stamina to run their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps popularity characteristics have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tr@@ ump released his can@@ did@@ ature in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University revealed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in the early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Iowa has found last week that 60 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good view from the re@@ im@@ plant .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P elec@@ tors GO@@ P would be happy to be happy as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages roughly the same enthusiasm such as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent ) , they would be &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about tr@@ ump . &quot;
the next in the excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican elec@@ torate that they were &quot; uns@@ afe &quot; or &quot; anno@@ ys &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the Favor@@ it of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the voters think that the real estate Mog@@ ul says the correct temper@@ ament for an president , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is considered in the first pre @-@ election state of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality of Commander in Chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively implement his ministry , and almost six out of 10 Independent States say that his tem@@ per is not in the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republican elec@@ tors are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the idea .
&quot; if they wake up their schol@@ ars , Republican elec@@ torate , hold a trap for real . &quot;
&quot; when they are asked , who wins the most likely the GO@@ P nomin@@ ation , say after a survey by CNN / OR@@ C , from last week four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; that is a change from the time when four of ten put money on Je@@ b Bush from ten end of July . &quot;
full publication : GO@@ P elec@@ tors had not had the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans , that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nomin@@ ation , but only 28 % voted for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it shows that a multitude of GO@@ P @-@ elec@@ tors Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign than plau@@ sible see . &quot;
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sco@@ oped with another candidate , tr@@ ump happens almost every day . &quot;
&quot; some experts refer to that the sh@@ atter@@ ed field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ pump support is spread to more than a dozen of other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of the mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republican candidates , Tr@@ ump sum re@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; he recently crossed Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally ahead of border Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christie 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who kills him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur for 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a cr@@ fl@@ ap of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says she has made their opinion .
&quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday reveals that only slightly more than half of voters that support Tr@@ ump , say that they have forgiven their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change this , and no one can really say , never change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nonetheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters think that they have formed their opinions , are twice as often for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on Immig@@ ration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his electoral campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called &quot; &quot; rape &quot; , &quot; the immigration and fishing work of the public dis@@ course was held in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic exc@@ use of the traditional Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans is remot@@ ely controlled from the Republican party and damage the re @-@ orient@@ ated efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey on Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with g@@ ump on questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; long as long as immigration in the spot@@ light remains , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do so . &quot;
the fru@@ stration about the government clim@@ bs to new high stands .
&quot; on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , more than half of the support of Republican elec@@ tors , notably by its out@@ si@@ der status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than anyone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also mad at Washington .
&quot; a survey of Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg shows two weeks ago that three of four Iowa rep@@ ublic@@ ans have fru@@ str@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans at Congress , with 54 percent &quot; harmless &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas of Germany &quot;
here in the hob@@ oo@@ king there is the most expensive residence - with a view over the North Sea .
&quot; in the street , a square meter indoor home cost 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euros . &quot;
&quot; the offer of objects is limited to Sy@@ lt , so it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular areas will cost a square meter .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; unlike Germany &apos;s top @-@ residential areas , however , one of the price remains as Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ l has published a rank@@ ings of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ al@@ ry in dizz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro nothing - per square meter , well @-@ noticed . &quot;
but well who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is here a closer look at the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double go@@ al@@ keeper in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
&quot; a lucky number by Thomas Müller was given the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus , and then ran it . &quot;
a convincing start of the Champions @-@ League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze created a dream start into the &quot; mission of Milan &quot; by Pi@@ raeus .
the team of train@@ ers P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their debut in the Champions League with the Greek record champion Olympics in hot atmosphere thanks to a garbage double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Göt@@ zes 1 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starter success in series will be the first step towards the finals on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
&quot; at his 28 hits in the Champions League for the Bayern @-@ Leadership award , Mu@@ th@@ rice was given to the Olympic champion of the Olympic champion , which would happen as a fl@@ ank fired shots of the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate her , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ame promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 h@@ ott@@ enn@@ ese fans - and the Munich mun@@ ich replied . &quot;
&quot; they showed a concentrated and eng@@ ined imagination , without having to shine . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ raeus won his most recent 6 home games in the p@@ inn@@ acle , among them famous clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled . &quot;
&quot; but the Bayern , defeated in seven European fre@@ t du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; they ran ag@@ bol@@ dly , however , in their open @-@ intensive efforts , but often too embar@@ r@@ able to work . &quot;
the attacks were often introduced to the link on Lin@@ ks@@ ville Douglas Costa who seldom passes the former German Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more fortunate than his fl@@ ank turned out of the right hemisphere at the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
&quot; the best occasions in half , Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski . &quot;
&quot; first , when the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the head@@ ball of Poland on the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then , with the direct collection , the ke@@ epers were par@@ ted with the knee ( 3@@ 5. ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bayern moved up their usual game , Pi@@ raeus succeeded ne@@ i@@ fer@@ ed . &quot;
but by Tor@@ ri@@ ter Manuel Street there was a decree .
&quot; for example , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye on the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; recently , new Gu@@ ardi@@ ola put a fourth fight with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , according to muscular problems in the ca@@ des , sat initially outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero had given the green light only after the final training , said Sports Executive Matthias Sam@@ mer on &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; if you want to do something different from this , it has become mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; for the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided to use the King@@ sley Com@@ an for a de@@ jected Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made ready for 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller , Müller was one better . &quot;
&quot; before the game , there was a tie in the stadium . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partly avoided German fans in their spectators block apparently prov@@ oked the followers of host Pir@@ ander with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with striking bre@@ aches of the Munich p@@ endants . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured in the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk , losing teeth &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t hurt who does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that puts a long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : when dis@@ claim@@ er the risk drops rapidly .
smoking permitted a significantly increased risk of losing its teeth early .
&quot; this emerg@@ es from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several members of the German Institute of Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in smoking to qu@@ itting smoking , the risk of losing its teeth at the time to cost the 2.@@ 5- to 3.6 @-@ d@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; the researchers were observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
&quot; major causes for loss of tooth dec@@ ay , c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , st@@ resses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ises the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of loss is therefore back to frequent g@@ ing@@ iv@@ itis in smoking .
&quot; not clear , however , smoking is also increased the risk of c@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; people who stopped smoking at smoking , however , could reduce their risk within a short time , writing the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take about ten years until the endang@@ ering came back to the level of qu@@ itting smoking , the first aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; men had to convince men of it , non @-@ smoking , declared study director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shortened the life period . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lung and vessels and leads to our knowledge as well as to a good dental health until the high age .
&quot; in Germany over 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years of insom@@ nia involved , the DI@@ f@@ E shared with . &quot;
previous tests have already noted that smoking is increasing the risk of early dental treatment .
the new long @-@ term study demonstrates the findings .
archae@@ ologists come across the Rhine @-@ Palat@@ inate centre on rem@@ nants of the late @-@ ancient
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological sites have been made on the right Rh@@ en@@ fer lake in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; in the proximity to the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , arch@@ e@@ ologists have excav@@ ated the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historic buildings , said Museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are on the search of so @-@ called ground monuments . &quot;
&quot; with all construction projects in the Cologne city district , the museum is constantly moved to Archae@@ ological and historic preser@@ vation . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards , the arch@@ e@@ ologists have been found to be found . &quot;
&quot; records from text documents have been already known that , in the 4th century , a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained in Trier . &quot;
&quot; beside the ruins of the fortress and the church of Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ ms , a cemetery of around 350 graves were also discovered that belonged to the church . &quot;

EU Commission proposes a new trial in dispute over TT@@ IP
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ral Tribunal for resol@@ ving over the proposed trans@@ atl@@ antic trade agreement ( TT@@ IP ) .
&quot; the controversial private safety devices for disp@@ utes between concert and states must therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which is significantly higher than traditional dishes in its functionality . &quot;
&quot; we want to set up a system which trust the citizens , &quot; said the president of Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström when performing . &quot;
the pig had pre @-@ negoti@@ ating the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
the world is set to create 800 million people by the TT@@ IP .
plans on the reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedures can be con@@ cre@@ ted that the EU states and the US have an independent judge for a new investment court .
&quot; they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
the first instance is scheduled for the first time .

&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost caught by Stev@@ ens lecture . &quot;
he tells the story of different places he always records on the map which he reviews his min@@ u@@ zi@@ es and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were created and how it looks like there in his homeland .
&quot; since then , Stev@@ ens has proven itself as a wonderful creative . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan , The Great Lake State &quot; dis@@ appears smart @-@ composed songs that cur@@ ls itself harmon@@ ically very close to the American folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time , opul@@ ent whe@@ eled dri@@ fts . &quot;

&quot; in addition to extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens reli@@ es on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) with well @-@ known electronic sales pieces . &quot;
&quot; this sixth record studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , however , by programming sequences or beats , and plays with all of the effect and Hall . &quot;

Jeremy Pres@@ by@@ ns made their debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo
&quot; since its election , Mr Cor@@ bit@@ es is eag@@ erly anticip@@ ating the Prime Minister &apos;s freight field . &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ ro@@ n is supposed to place his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s freight field and compet@@ ed for the first time with David Cameron . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ bit@@ n is going to charge up the first of his six pre@@ set questions shortly after noon of what his performance by the media is likely to be tested and the Labour MPs from the near future .
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could safely ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the encounter will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ bit@@ n &apos;s leadership , because it comes to a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett and after his speech at the TU@@ C Conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Party , conducted in silence at the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS in silence and stands at the centre of several cover pages in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ bit@@ es &apos;s decision to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne , has attracted attention to itself &quot;
&quot; a speaker by Mr Cor@@ bit@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; standing in respect with silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism around the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ ro@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the BBC &apos;s two news program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; ir@@ respective &quot; of its faith that the monarchy should be abolished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of the shadow Minist@@ ries have refused to serve at Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and she calls for differences in the economy , defence , and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Parliamentary Party was initially supported as leader . &quot;
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political dis@@ agreements are also st@@ ack@@ able within &quot; Labour &quot; and following Mr Cor@@ bit@@ es &apos;s position on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ ro@@ n said the TU@@ C conference said Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of the shadow and pensions , said the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ bit@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , ever since he is T@@ ory leader , over the last decade on the Disp@@ atch box in Parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another issue of policies , says that he gave &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 ideas . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP has said that the presi@@ dium of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ational , and that he is under@@ lining both &quot; impact &quot; and stra@@ it with obstacles , and to concentrate on serious problems like poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ bit@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who is the shadow of foreign ministers , is represented , if he does not take part - for example if Mr Cameron is on the road . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into talking , that other colleagues at occasionally lay the word , and that he said John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; as he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron announced he was turning away from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theater . &quot; but some years later he admitted that he was vers@@ ed in it . &quot;
&quot; when she was first sent to television first in 1990 , the fre@@ er was regarded as the most important Bar@@ ometer of the leader of a leader and his position in the Lower House and his position among his par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , though critics have argu@@ ed to have become a caric@@ ature and require far reaching reforms . &quot;

pound rises by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound crossed off after data that show an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom . in parallel the FT@@ SE 100 was enhanced by the SA@@ BM@@ iller building project .
&quot; between May and July , earnings without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % over the same period last year . &quot;
this percentage was the fastest and generated en@@ ass@@ essments on the time of interest @-@ auction .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1.@@ 550@@ 5 and was up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro at 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index has an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % , following the acquisition of the rival AB Indians . &quot;
&quot; one transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and brands such as bud@@ get@@ ers , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ z@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; following encouraging messages from the competition , Bur@@ berry shares were 0,9 % higher , following the rival for luxury goods . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ chem@@ a &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry , will keep growth again . &quot;
&quot; stocks of Glen@@ core rose 5 % , after the mining period said that it took 2.5 billion $ by a share selling as part of its strategy of debt reduction . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packing and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sachs has sold his assessment for the Company &apos;s Company rating . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose 3.1 % after the sports unit had reported a pre @-@ tax result of € 4@@ 6.6 million for the first half of the year .
chief of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill states that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the hand@@ bags of the potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power , the higher cost of labor in his company , says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could hit an expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there is less additional work@@ places . &quot;

not bad .
hundreds of fans cross the Justin yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
&quot; at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the pole sat on the cold stone sla@@ b at the Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; the Bie@@ ber construction : here you can find I@@ dol , whose poster hang on in St@@ ett@@ in hang@@ s , since Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; the suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , will cost the day exactly as much as her m@@ um E@@ wa earned in half a year . &quot;
if at all .
it says : &quot; actually my Vik@@ toria would have to sit in the tenth class in the High School .
&quot; I fill her a dream . &quot;
school attendance ?
who ju@@ ches it ?
the fans do not .
also Bie@@ ber does not apply .
he is worried about it .
&quot; advertisement In the advertising note of the Super@@ bar@@ k , he was three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ Pic@@ kel company many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account . &quot;
&quot; and with each doll that looks like he and above the shop , Bie@@ ber also c@@ assi@@ es . &quot;
&quot; when Justin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , they were astonished at the window . &quot;
there will be more than 100 million exploited .
some say the h@@ ype went too far .
other bet@@ ting and bet@@ ting is finally just in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you destroy ? &quot; in 1st place .
&quot; Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is supposed to follow in November , does not interest the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least he does so .
Peg@@ i@@ da poster brings up Lebanese to potato @-@ ön@@ er @-@ idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; it is both - and in the potato @-@ ön@@ er , the Ol@@ den@@ berg owner of the Han@@ i Al@@ hay fever . &quot;
&quot; the phrase &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; inspired by the phrase , has put potato and meat together on a poster . &quot;
&quot; at the idea , a poster was given him a poster with the inscription &quot; potatoes &quot; instead of D@@ ön@@ er , which he had seen incid@@ entally in TV . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wer that is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multi @-@ cult for your stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
the idea has now reached an idea in the Lebanese patent offices in Munich .
&quot; according to the agency , it has been protected as utility models since recently . &quot;
&quot; like a lot of meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ e@@ wer contains , Al@@ hay will not tell you . &quot;
it &apos;s only as much : &quot; it tastes better together . &quot;
&quot; even with its customers , the culinary international understanding is good . &quot;
met@@ cash launches ground @-@ cash campaign to fight al@@ m@@ - in@@ fest@@ ation
met@@ er@@ cash tries to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of a Al@@ di @-@ rally in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholes@@ al@@ ers &amp; cash has launched a ground level campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run of a 700 million US al@@ di @-@ invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di was preparing the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia earlier the next year , strengthen metast@@ ases and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets and build the brand IG@@ A through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing about the social media as well as events such as Adelaide Show . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ A tra@@ der and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as iron manufacturers , view@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who sell supplies and shop owners in IG@@ A shops and sell tickets for the South Australian football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be able to provide further details of his defense strategy on 29 September , if the wholes@@ al@@ ers of the wholes@@ al@@ ers will take through the annual investors strategy on food , alcohol , and equipment . &quot;
&quot; it is far on the game , because South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shops to generate greater profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; shop@@ pers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland , more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to about 14 percent in Eastern countries . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts at Morgan Stanley believe that Al@@ di will take five percent of the market in these two states after opening its first markets in these two states ; however , mainly independent retail sales will take away . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this report , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley estimates that IG@@ A @-@ retail@@ er would lose $ 360 million in revenue per year and met@@ alizing $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and grocery store and at the concentrations of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed base , met@@ alizing could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time metal shares will lose market shares in the Eastern nations , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently carried out survey by Roy Morgan discovered that IG@@ A buyers are the nearest . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stanley assumes that met@@ c@@ ash@@ s turnover in the food and food market grew by 3.8 percent in 2016 , and by 2.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will reduce to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that met@@ er@@ cash would probably disappear within one decade . met@@ er@@ cash will van@@ ish . &quot;
Met@@ ers rejected it publicly to respond publicly to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member is taken in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , IG@@ As &apos;s market share has fallen by 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenue from met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting its operating relief breakdown at the same time pressure on sales and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ al@@ ers , however , inv@@ ests and investing more than $ 150 million in order to equ@@ alize sales prices with col@@ es and vo@@ ol@@ d@@ ths of hundreds of products each week with improving their shops due to growing fresh food and to provide a better choice of private @-@ label food . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price cuts and loading san@@ it@@ ising programmes for Elan vit@@ alise , and hopes that major dealers in 2017 will return to profit growth for the first time in four years . &quot;
&quot; Than@@ asi bi@@ kin@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , USA &quot;
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behavior .
&quot; Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ater@@ ally damage &quot; &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios , and deserves praise as criticism for his own behavior . &quot;
&quot; the younger son Du@@ os , who is still named &quot; &quot; Special KS &quot; , &quot; became the not@@ orious discussion of C@@ yr@@ gios with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters at the spot@@ light . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying match in Cincinnati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent had to be defeated twice with the refer@@ ee , where Harrison had asked : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have sm@@ ashed Cy@@ ril and I should strike the child . &quot;
&quot; last time he saw a tennis ra@@ cket which struck a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp@@ f defended a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ chil@@ ak@@ is defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ finals against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing that I en@@ vi@@ ate me is the fact that after my view of Than@@ asi was dra@@ fted somewhat in the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket at the US Open as he lost because of a cr@@ amp@@ ath in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat of fru@@ stration among themselves , and I know Than@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of that . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has been extremely well beha@@ ved in the US Open , even under the quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on and I think he deser@@ ved a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was a little too strictly treated . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he trains hard , he is a very stable and sophisticated young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own services . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly did not support the decision to take C@@ yr@@ gios at the important decision decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint choice &quot; as the right for everyone , but he protects the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term firm to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is entirely focused on the competition and not all the contro@@ versy around &#91; Cy@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I think that Nick has made very quick adv@@ ancement on what people like Feder@@ er and Murray pointed out , and ear@@ ns all the criticism that he gets , but we try to think about it , and it is best for the team , and it is best for the team and it is best for him and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; refugee Crisis : Hungary states emergency booth , closes the border , keeps refugees &quot;
&quot; Hungary declared the emergency and ended the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all that tried to get illegal to the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants were re@@ acted in an Ni@@ em@@ and@@ land and Serbian officials .
&quot; the people who had fled before violence , were stuck in a rock on the road between the two points of the country and built tents , and settled there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations went to .
&quot; as a police helicopter above them , the migrants &apos; opened the border . &apos; and they cried out to the rebels against the Hungarian ri@@ ot police . &quot;
some exp@@ els from protest food and water back .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it is &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants would return from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ ally harm .
&quot; in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries have to take place , I@@ vic@@ a Dac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian Serbian Border came to a day after the 28 @-@ nation block at a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who had taken refuge in the shr@@ unk Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary doesn &apos;t set its hopes for a bal@@ ust@@ omed action of Brussels or its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency was rested in two southern regions in two southern regions of the crisis , so that they could accelerate Greece &apos;s roads and asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to , however , said that his country also plan the construction of a bar@@ bed wire to Romania in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants following the country - after an fence on the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison systems were used in running , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and the entrance to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the emerging economic refugees are seeking refugee &apos;s search for a better life , and not war refugees , which are strongly contra@@ diction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws that came into effect at midnight , crossing the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ us , to build the government along the southern border with Serbia , to create a crime . these laws also set up longer detention sentences . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian Government explains the emergency state , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed troops with vehicles and dogs on the border . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security adviser to Or@@ ban , said that authorities have caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come down by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in custody , and are accused of crimes of crimes according to the new law . &quot;
authorities are easy to repair the fence .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , two of the seven border trans@@ itions left with Serbia , after having signed a bar@@ bed wire with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos gave the main border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and sting a crowd to turn them there . &quot;
&quot; some 20 managed to enter , but thousands of stay remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection from Serbia and Hungary and said that they would stay food and water until they are travelling to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders
&quot; Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double lead in the democratic race for the nomin@@ ation at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gains opposite to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now received the backing of 47 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate in the pre@@ election ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders stands on the second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Joe Bi@@ den , Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , has not announced if he was candidate for the presidential candidate , assi@@ sting 15 percent of the pre@@ sidents of the pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the pre@@ elections , most democratic elec@@ tors say that it is too early to say that their opinion stands , which candidates can support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more resistant than the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders posted some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton is holding a huge lead in women and vegetables , but these demonstrations have decreased . &quot;
&quot; their support for the men is significantly reduced , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s benefit with democratic voters of less than 50 years has failed , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
Clinton has still another advantage in the older voters .
&quot; last month , Clinton was facing another two @-@ digit advantage with the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has a 5 @-@ point lead at this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the elections in Poland declared that they would support the enthusiasm , if they were nominated by the party . &quot;
one quarter would support them with some reviews and other 15 per cent would only support them because they are the can@@ di@@ ers .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters mainly thr@@ illed by it .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of democratic elec@@ torate , the elections tell you that they will help him with enthusiasm , say less Republican elec@@ torate , about their leading candidates Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clin@@ ics are questioned in an open question , why they want it to be the correct answer ( 16 per cent ) , followed by the fact that it is time for a woman president ( 13 per cent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supp@@ orter is also mentioned in her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval to deal with problems and elec@@ tors are also cited .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president raises potential for the presidential candidate in the scales , 57 percent of democratic voters would like to see him on the race - even though a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked to be asked , who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
&quot; of Clinton &apos;s followers , more than half of which Bi@@ den would be different from being different . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den decided not to can@@ di@@ re for the nomin@@ ation of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton increased his advantage against S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race for 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic elec@@ tors are shown to see Clinton &apos;s can@@ di@@ ers with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has fallen from 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second with this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; dial &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , at the question of what candidates is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about voters . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the last month , no one Democratic candidate or potential candidate for that elec@@ torate is considered in@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates bring good results with some important features in the voters of their party &apos;s sel@@ ections .
&quot; at the same time , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong guides . &quot;
&quot; the three candidates is best thr@@ illed with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leader . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of all democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the pre@@ election see in general also Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ological ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; with all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic elec@@ tors have no opinion of different . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s personal e @-@ mail address and ser@@ vers continue to be challenged during the term of office as Minister of Foreign Affairs , most of the Democratic voters of the pre@@ sidents are pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions are not affected . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , whereas only one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was in March , just after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no effect on their general views of Clinton , even though 36 percent said that their opinion of her still wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views from Clinton had become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted by the voters of her party , this is still a problem for them at a registered voters . only 32 per cent see it as tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of voters think they do not hold a honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voters think so that Tr@@ ump is quite honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes upon leadership . &quot;
&quot; from the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush do best with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority of people see it rather than hon@@ estly , but as at Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters of the preliminary election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son returns to a country @-@ far@@ ed pol@@ l - behind Donald Tr@@ ump on
Ben Car@@ son is situated close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times .
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the support of elec@@ torate in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republican Presi@@ dential voters continue to support m@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , increased 27 % in the survey . &quot;
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
&quot; the survey also yiel@@ ded that , on demo@@ graphic groups , he sur@@ passes more than Republican elec@@ torate with university education . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Governor John Kas@@ ich , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins , Scott Walker , who is at the deepest , and 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former province of Florida Je@@ b Bush , the former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are with 6 % in third place . &quot;
the error code at the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of the Republican elec@@ tors in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , released last week shows that Car@@ son asc@@ ends in the p@@ olls - he ends up at 19 % support for rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
&quot; the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed the ump on Tr@@ ump , notably . &quot;
&quot; with views of one in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some of the rails for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s belief in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign in Iowa . &quot;
pleasant pool temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; although peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bath@@ ro@@ l@@ ur@@ ers to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; no longer goes to the sea . at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water has access to the north and Baltic Sea in this week , the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) is divided . &quot;
&quot; the bath temperatures still offers the Mediterranean Sea : in the East , it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died while a student union during a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pa . , M@@ ord@@ an@@ kin will appeal against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory rit@@ ual during September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which led to his death . &quot;
&quot; civil servants said that he had been bur@@ dened and bur@@ sted with a 30 pound ru@@ ck@@ sack , while he tried to pursue a frozen field on a target . &quot;
&quot; last@@ ly , Mr. Den@@ g said about heada@@ ches , he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g had wo@@ oned and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital such as the police .
&quot; but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes to contact his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to take counsel , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of the mainstre@@ am began to hide and set the br@@ otherhood for the br@@ otherhood of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Police St@@ ef . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning to his hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; after a Autop@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; for many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year on the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , who represents a lawyer with D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ der@@ lands and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
&quot; a County Grand Jury , Monroe received an indictment due to murder in the first five members . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of criminal attacks and education of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to make the person involved , but when there is an organization that has been officially or un@@ official - this will also be sanc@@ tion@@ ed , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ wed its affili@@ ation to the spatial group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; interest increases , and the house will get into the sl@@ ender , proceeds for bonds , and the economy will slip into recession . &quot;
we know this .
&quot; what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last , how long it will stop . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the history for the economy is only a small guide to the process . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve for raising the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in doing such as the economy and financial investments . &quot;
&quot; consequently , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank are so viol@@ ently stressed that investors should not concentrate on it when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could state that the whole excitement may be exagger@@ ated because of interest income . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is being interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief economist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest on normal heights , but still on a low level , in order to be a seis@@ mic shock which seem to fear many . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect . &quot;
&quot; here , a historical trend is based on historical trends , how some areas of the economy might react : &quot;
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the accus@@ ation of interest in aluminium is for a while vol@@ ati@@ l . &quot;
as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatically . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a trend that gen@@ ial cases may be ab@@ dic@@ ated 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which is perhaps once more del@@ aying the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ st in a recent study to what happened in the after@@ math of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market has been mostly in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate hike , fairly flat in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , which published Bob D@@ oll , chief facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en asset management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares were to occur later on the cur@@ ative cycle and the yield is to be reduced .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of business skin , but interest in aluminium , they often promote . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some conditions that could not speed it before and accelerate the recession . &quot;
&quot; it is very interesting here , that the gross domestic product in the proximity of its lowest point in interest is to be the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the average annual GDP stood below 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was about 3.6 percent , just a few likely that this will last for the third quarter , and anticip@@ ate only 1.5 percent for the third quarter . &quot;
&quot; pers@@ ist in case of such frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop might be ris@@ ky and ask the question , &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; market participants have taken the whole year on an interest rate against the F@@ ed , and all eyes were judged on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week that ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could increase a increase in this session , the Fut@@ ures trading provides only a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all enh@@ ancing cy@@ c@@ lical cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a Super @-@ cycle with increasing fluctu@@ ations in GDP and on prior @-@ rec@@ essi@@ on@@ sh@@ it was made very fast after the start of recovery in the sha@@ dows , according to the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a very slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
the current cycle is by far the longest ever since the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months and this has been 74 months .
&quot; the solid income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market is a pri@@ c@@ ence increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic value .
bonds issued an end to change the direction as soon as the first increase / lowering occurs in the cycle .
&quot; at the end of the growth cycle , the bond proceeds immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates would lead to result , that returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a strain of the curve . &quot;
&quot; often , high @-@ interest bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate even though we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect longer yields , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come An@@ al@@ yst@@ ine , in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; what is interesting , Jones that the markets has already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; besides the magn@@ itude of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some evidence that the market has adjusted to the prospec@@ t of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short interest rates are lower , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit@@ or@@ ships have expanded and the vol@@ atility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and around , businesses that get the larger part of their business activities in the USA will benefit from interest rates and attractive local products . &quot;
multin@@ ational companies with high debt will be worse because a growing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and as well as funding of their debt .
&quot; the history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive for three months after initial rate of interest , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs analysts in a report for the customer . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have been sur@@ passed by 5 percentage points of interest after each of the interest expenses in the period of 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
&quot; with high capital companies and low vol@@ atility in their shares , their counter@@ parts also exceeded their counter@@ parts at a low level of 4 ( percentage points ) , and 3 ( percentage points ) . &quot;
debt is a big problem .
&quot; with a high percentage of flexible interest rates , Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from increasing U.S. dollars . &quot;
&quot; as@@ par@@ s could see gains through higher earnings , even if experts in different opinions are how fast this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
the Con@@ serv@@ atives Member of the Parliament crit@@ ici@@ zed the transmitter because of its &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot;
he has argu@@ ed that he is not to distinguish becoming increasingly from commercial rival .
he also raised to the BBC Music Awards and said she only quoted The Br@@ its .
parliamentary collector Dam@@ ien Collins took the programme The Voice to and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does not do something that does not do the private broadcasting . &quot;
Andrew B@@ ingham Con@@ serv@@ atives also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public radio station &quot; ev@@ oked &quot; and increasingly won &apos;t be different from its commercial compet@@ itor .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I &apos;m not using the word &quot; &quot; dam@@ s &quot; , &quot; but it seems to transform himself into the Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also raised the BBC Music Awards , starting in December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , started last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spont@@ aneously called examples in which you are just im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General rejected the accus@@ ations , argu@@ ed that the BBC Radio 3 was set far ahead of his commercial compet@@ itor when it comes to live music and education . &quot;
what I learn from Radio 3 I will learn about classical music somewhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music @-@ making music really un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , to find new music and put new works in order , I also get really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller , Alan Dav@@ ey , argu@@ ed that harder to engage with the audience as it did in the past , because the British were less about classical music . &quot;
&quot; but radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , during the hearing of the committee on the selection of culture , media , and sport under fire , into the commercial spot on its feet . &quot;
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Collins from The Voice to - the musical talent show of the BBC that was purchased from Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million pounds .
&quot; do you see why this programme is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; was produced on a special BBC fashion . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wishes to find the company &quot; a hit from our house @-@ house stable &quot; when it is the next time a entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to include the order from The Voice of The Voice of the future or to make money from the ag@@ ü@@ hr@@ ah@@ ler for other entertainment formats . &quot;
&quot; net sales increased in August at slow@@ est time , and the Black Friday may be responsible for it . &quot;
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales strengthened three years ago through the use of mobile phones to shopping
&quot; experts believe that the Black Friday slow@@ ed in November , in November . &quot;
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping is dr@@ illed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are now reports that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure of August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
&quot; experts say that there are indications that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating , after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 &quot;
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , then it has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales complex the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales were strengthened for three years ago , as the purch@@ aser started to work with their cell phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now the one comm@@ utes himself , and we might want to see that growth has been reduced . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for decl@@ ining sales . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that purch@@ as@@ ers return their purchases before this event , which will take place on Friday last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers increases their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer websites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday could wi@@ pe off the buyer because of the bar@@ gain , buyers might think about it . &quot;
the British Retail Con@@ sortium study found out that £ 5 spending had a little more than 1 £ online .
some products such as TV and washing machines are now carried out more than one @-@ third of the purchases via web shops .
&quot; at the same time , more than one quarter of the people buys clothing and shoes online instead of the fashion chains . &quot;
Muslims buried in the Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tion@@ ed
&quot; the bodies of 29 dead are borne of Muslims in the first pris@@ ons in Mec@@ ca , through the streets . &quot;
Saudi Arabia reli@@ es down the defeat of the giant Saudi bin Laden group to load
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured , after the crane collapsed . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Muslims were gathered together when 29 of the victims were worn by the streets to bury the buried , as a crane collapsed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s major mosque . &quot;
&quot; filled the mour@@ ners , mostly dressed in white , the it@@ iner@@ ary to z@@ ollen , when the first of the dead sat down their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ m @-@ gra@@ vey@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession passed on to the Holy Sites , where only days before had been a building crane by the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bed collapsed . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi King issued about the construction company of the family Bin Laden because of the catastrophe which also deposited 3@@ 94 Ver@@ so , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 coats , who were killed as a crane collapsed in the Great Central Mos@@ que Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane collapsed . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents in front of the annual H@@ add@@ in in the Great mosque .
&quot; Saudi officials have already promised , that the p@@ addle for Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city will continue . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group would have not been standing on the arm of the crane , than he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree released by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency in the English news agency reported not this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership are prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man appeared to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the big mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were killed in this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden group has not issued any statements about the Coll@@ ap@@ se , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ ored the group because of not current measures because it does not cooperate with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes surround the Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mosque compound as part of the massive building project being led by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to the host family of Saudi Arabia and takes over major projects since decades .
&quot; the late leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a progressive son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane collapsed in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in life of each healthy diet . &quot;
some 158 people said in the hospital .
&quot; government officials prescribed that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same sum of permanently injured . &quot;
half of this amount received one half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss states that the time of the cheapest of Eastern European professionals is over
&quot; British employ increasingly professional tra@@ des@@ man , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of qualified tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe came to rise again
&quot; leading to more than 200 pre @-@ fix stores , aimed at cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople , will be opened &quot;
&quot; at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will join 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide . &quot;
&quot; from Ru@@ pert Steiner , City leader of the Daily Mail . &quot;
it will claims that British will perform their h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men who perform the work in their home .
&quot; if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to the sp@@ ouse of walls , you nowadays belong to a minority . &quot;
&quot; because Br@@ its increasingly employ professionals to perform home jobs jobs in their houses , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ fis@@ her , who possesses the tre@@ k necklace , said that a great increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , which offer services at deep prices is now over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other screens to open their range of art@@ is@@ ans and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions in the store are taken by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , men killed the men . &quot;
&quot; it said that it is necessary to set up the growing demo@@ graphic trends which feature more female single @-@ households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move this stronger than a balance .

MS@@ I / DO@@ B &apos;s function due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity
&quot; at the Kl@@ agen@@ furt river , Wednesday , two officials of Austrian &apos;s volleyball @-@ champion , a@@ I / DO@@ B have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ab@@ etting . &quot;
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them had also been indicted for ministers .
he was acquitted on behalf of this accus@@ ation in May .
the present process was post@@ pon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney of Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ endants had cryst@@ all@@ ised in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants were used in the years 2006 @-@ 2011 when they were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions , used for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; it costs the damage , with approximately 400.000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged with funding .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ ens@@ en@@ ats , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; according to the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence counsel that the association could not have a wealth of wealth . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials would have had only temporary damages and the sports club for whom they had been working for it from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , the Passi@@ va was investing some 600,000 Sch@@ illing ( about 4@@ 4.000 euros ) in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; at that time we stood before the situation : do we continue the club or lock it ? , &quot; told one of the def@@ endants , in the bread profession of large @-@ scale trucks . &quot;
he subsequently decided to join this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shot money , our life insurance as safety at the bank , &quot; he said on the redemption . &quot;
&quot; be agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , there are only no debts . &quot;
&quot; moreover , during the appropriate financial success the payout from the temporary damages endu@@ red until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the damages damages only years later , namely , as of the year 2003 , was paid out as an increase in the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore flat and non @-@ detailed entries seemed to be explained , and the former fruit drew up the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and as@@ par@@ s administered the two def@@ endants in common , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the exclusion of the association did not appear in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not interest in detail for the financial crisis , important is just the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , an investig@@ ative investig@@ ator was reported to mark the mark of 120@@ ,000 euros on the audit@@ or &apos;s account . &quot;
the def@@ endants had been fulfilled .
&quot; this value account expired on the names of the second accused , and was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? , &quot; who wanted to know the judge . &quot;
the answer for a long time knew nothing .
&quot; finally he said , he thought that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; something happened to him would have had something from that money , the prosecutor asked the public prosecutor in the room . &quot;
the co @-@ accused was noti@@ fied of inform@@ ing and just@@ i@@ fi@@ ably the function@@ ary .
this transfer is form@@ ulated as &quot; compensation Dec@@ ree . &quot;
why damage to damage ? we wanted to know judge and prosec@@ uting attor@@ ney .
&quot; the first accused was to compl@@ ain that he did not agree with this formulation , since the club never had been a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all of the tail@@ or . &quot;
&quot; am I a representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; the function@@ ary said the function@@ ary , that I have never drawn a p@@ enny salary , he reck@@ ons only o@@ dom@@ ity and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; he has charged € 1,000 per month for di@@ ets , but the actual expense was much higher but added to the actual expense , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years could not refer to the def@@ endants .
&quot; these are classified according to an operational test , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared no longer . &quot;
Kilomet@@ res also had the second def@@ endants .
&quot; all the creatures are in cash , in which he had to depart from a home market to the Bank according to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his testimony . &quot;
the trial will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard makes another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to this , for three years , the Compu@@ ra will be able to consoli@@ date and consoli@@ date more jobs in the development of the company . &quot;
the results of the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) computer supports no end .
&quot; the US technology group will organise a reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate customer operations in the context of its restructuring . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs in the amount of 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) will be saved by the company on Tuesday . &quot;
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion resulting from the fourth quarter .
&quot; the current reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs has not yet been completed , though . &quot;
&quot; in the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP had approximately 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;

conflict : a majority support the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; a direct involvement of German soldiers on mar@@ tial arts in Iraq , however , would mainly apply to re@@ jection : 54 per cent said , by contrast , 35 percent proved to be agreed . &quot;
&quot; while other states fly to the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , 24 percent are opposed to interv@@ ene in the conflict . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : escal@@ ator of Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
&quot; on the Serbian border , the Hungarian police arrived at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ works for several hundred fores@@ kins refugees . &quot;
Eur@@ one@@ ws @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ án@@ iel Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the Dis@@ claim@@ er at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees defeated the border .
behind it a polic@@ eman sho@@ cked up and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water designer ready .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began to cast stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the public officials . &quot;
the officials initially set free pep@@ per@@ al spray .
afterwards the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn a bit strange now .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried out . &quot;
other refugees rein@@ forces themselves together and l@@ ayed in trouble during the breath .
also the press Officer of the Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of lac@@ ri@@ pen@@ as and pep@@ per@@ al spray .
time of choice on interest rates for the US @-@ database
&quot; the world is observed if the US database was set on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to meet the important decision , whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who have been questioned by Reuters , found that a little more than half that the F@@ ed will do this now , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and maintain interest rates at the current status of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a historical event because it is seven years ago , since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est won on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may be leaving the zero @-@ area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , Executive Chairman at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good performance , trillion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less@@ er outlook on global standards . &quot;
&quot; it has been warned for setting up the markets , but the signs indicate that the odds for such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
death @-@ protecting victims at the Delta State University
&quot; after the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues shot on Monday , Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say that he could &quot; sorry &quot; with the first murder and wanted it to be &quot; sorry &quot; by the authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social science at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , he shot and killed someone . &quot;
&quot; on the staff of the emergency call , Lamb told police to send police officers to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet little dog &quot; is in the house , but nobody will be b@@ other@@ ed , but probably will be more excited . &quot;
the police asked the An@@ ru@@ fer according to his name but he didn &apos;t give him .
lamb had no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as the police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ un@@ bite , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I am so tired , I wanted it to be revers@@ ed . &quot;
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , coming from 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing him before he eventually took his own life on Monday evening when police officers en@@ cir@@ cled it . &quot;
&quot; Professor William La@@ For@@ ge said he got anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday the Lamb is believed that Pr@@ un@@ ition had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said that there was no information , no evidence , no evidence of a &quot; triangle relation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ un@@ ition was born by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married about seven years ago , as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but stayed friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ un@@ iss have had a daughter who is 19 , and they were destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said Pr@@ un@@ will@@ s were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ un@@ bite worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ un@@ ition . &quot;
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ un@@ ition who had a dog named Light@@ ning has met with lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , &apos; Lamb had called on a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he did not go into prison . &quot;
&quot; when police captured him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , lamb turned his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of 2015 , Lamb State University awarded a PhD from the University of the University . &quot;

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa plans a major division construction .
&quot; with a better organisation , the Lufthansa Group will save half a billion euros a year alone . &quot;
&quot; 150 of the worldwide will cost around 1000 managers worldwide , the Group building will charge the workplace . &quot;
with the pilot work there are some of the new negotiations .
the airline is building its enterprise structure and evalu@@ ates the Euro@@ wings Beach service .
&quot; the re@@ organization of the real@@ ignment is a result of a profit contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue sy@@ ner@@ gies , the airline par@@ ked . &quot;
among other things there is no Committee for the passenger transportation in the future .
the Euro@@ wings airline distance should be developed as independent as possible .
&quot; in the current team , CEO Carsten Spo@@ hr will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the future . &quot;
&quot; with the re@@ positioning , spo@@ ol@@ es under@@ scores the importance of Euro@@ wings , which will oppos@@ e the Group in the future against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet . &quot;
&quot; so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex . &quot;
&quot; under the roof of the passage Air@@ line Group , the company operates three quarters of the annual revenue of € 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilot

Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United can &apos;t play twice for double fra@@ cture
&quot; at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ cture of his right hand . &quot;
&quot; while the left @-@ hand def@@ ending champion has brought him to wines , Louis van Ga@@ al will not leave the hope for at least six months , that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
injury was caused by a back@@ th@@ less attack of H@@ é@@ hat Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and required oxygen before being brought to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg extension and is located in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he will be re@@ located tomorrow or maybe one day later , then in Manchester . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who gets 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;
he had a oxygen mask in the changing cabin .
he cried .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor if you have a double fra@@ cture , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the hanging of a eleven metre .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican . &quot;
&quot; van Ga@@ al proves that the Italian arbit@@ er had been mist@@ aken . &quot;
&quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that a penalty of eleven and one red card was ob@@ sol@@ ete . &quot;
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; a T@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe as kap@@ ut I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
in the way : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat at the PS@@ V .
the European leader in France has an additional inc@@ entive for the European Championship to recover from coming to next June .
&quot; Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very cl@@ aw@@ ful injury . &quot;
&quot; if a player leaves this type of injury to the place , everyone is very sad about that . &quot;
it is never the intention of our player to harm an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg emp@@ tied graves with Van Ga@@ As Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it wasn &apos;t his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot;
it was not possible for me to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , who was in another direction , so that it looked like &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel really bad . I &apos;m so tired of that .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ aking play by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it &apos;s a thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t last long until you know it almost . &quot;
&quot; unless you are , you are David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; as he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , decided in 1971 from Dr. Se@@ uss , 1971 . &quot;
&quot; he was a difficult elections , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the firm Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my kids , because it &apos;s always a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in the Cameron allegedly described the action of the book , instead added a summary of the film version of 2012 , added to the new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , to see the heart of Au@@ drey whose desire was to see a real tree , was fulfilled . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el was silent and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this would not be dou@@ bly enough : the text of Cameron outlines how the summary of the presentation of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , hopes to attract the heart of Au@@ drey , to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; even though he would seem to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems that Cameron is already familiar to the plot of the book as little . here &apos;s an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the yellow @-@ bear@@ ers Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ urs@@ ed , heavy boy , that is ra@@ v@@ aged in the name of the trees . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a helper that the Lor@@ ax had not read 20 times succ@@ essively a child . &quot;
a Do@@ wning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text had probably come from Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s electoral station .
&quot; super@@ camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons staff , but there was no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England &apos;s crew , but it still is difficult &quot;
&quot; turning to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you chose the Ka@@ es that has chosen the UK for the tour , an repet@@ ition of the 3 @-@ 0 test serial defeat does not appear on my card . &quot;
I would not close a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in Batt@@ lefield itself , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not wear any sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a young spin @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali developed as a spin @-@ player and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even when it represents an unknown size on the test plane is an option for the attack . &quot;
this message : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving from the England @-@ test squ@@ ad and will be replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is difficult for me as his principal trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ ker are based on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nomin@@ ation , since - and I said this before - players are their very best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one would have extended the movement of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own dest@@ iny . &quot;
&quot; hopefully he runs more shopping for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance appears . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good achievements , and that surprises me ; it is especially a team man . &quot;
&quot; the question how much time has a test b@@ ats@@ man receives , in order to put his mark , is difficult . &quot;
&quot; Ly@@ th received seven chances - such as Sam Rob@@ son before him , during Nick N@@ ret@@ on nine . &quot;
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to do home and moving .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can rise , was that England first made Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a b@@ ats@@ man whom I am high .
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ k@@ et@@ ker , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he saw 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those obtained before him , but this depends , of course , of course , in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of allowing Mo@@ dies@@ els next to Cook , which would bring an extra spin @-@ off player and receive four qu@@ cks , and I didn &apos;t notice anything about it . &quot;
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man can &apos;t strike there and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a devil @-@ field of cri@@ cket @-@ players .
&quot; Mo@@ az has perhaps did his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my original team @-@ mate Justin Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests on the first Drop before he appeared as an open@@ er in 2001 .
he has managed three hundred ra@@ gs immediately and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Sh@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his st@@ ats - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and thinking , it &apos;s a punch though , but there is no large number of backup che@@ ers that arise their hands and their train@@ ers have chosen young . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the train@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the most nic@@ est not@@ ch of the game , which is a wealth of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment to the setup setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket @-@ contest , as a player or a coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can produce fresh wind in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previous . &quot;
&quot; coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used during the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot was a similar break to Australia and I have no problem with this . &quot;
some will not agree with but co@@ aches and team perform@@ ers do not determine the schedule .
&quot; and you must remember , as with the players on their jobs from the results . &quot;
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
a Bre@@ xit @-@ bearing ( Bre@@ xit = withdrawal of Britain out of the EU ) might gain acceptance by the economy until 2017 .
&quot; David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ made a re @-@ negoti@@ ation strategy to hold Britain in the EU with every day , even without the election of the in@@ gen@@ ial Jeremy &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ bit@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C that severely de@@ posed in Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; foreigners also have their cor@@ ns , and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend said , recently , some member states , as the EU has now fallen and not always from their own fault , Great Britain itself , created agenda with mir@@ ro@@ red conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing conclusion that they do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Brighton , TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it does not like it to end@@ anger the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Minister of Finance rise to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , a photo of oneself from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win ally for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European Friend , who wishes to be looking for an immediate great Britain within the EU &apos;s tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and leaves out that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials from some capit@@ als have come up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s auti@@ ous German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for her , as it is bad for them how Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) has happened . &quot;
France &apos;s François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a da@@ zz@@ ling force .
&quot; Poland perhaps soon became a nation@@ alistic right government , Spain one left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they become one leg , to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British , whose energy should be used to prevent from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separat@@ ist ten@@ dencies have to be used . &quot;
&quot; hence , some such ministers must even deliberately not plan help to speed up a Bre@@ xit in the SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s spokesperson for a Bre@@ xit , susp@@ ects my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a Ple@@ ite , and &quot; Britain has won nothing of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how to use the Fle@@ et Street on their charges and which EU scep@@ tics , the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons , however , did not have been inspired by Tony the press in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they may also be weak to Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists , who has made a name as a &quot; &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; in Brussels in the early 90 @-@ 1970s . &quot;
&quot; with all his de@@ w@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who was his enemies . &quot;
&quot; the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ sp@@ itting sha@@ ken , telephone @-@ h@@ acked pron@@ unci@@ ation , and pseu@@ do non @-@ in@@ countries belonging to most of our big newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air thought about them , but noted that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , a better ban@@ anas can be distributed to di@@ stra@@ ct him instead of his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air himself , when he was opposed to Cam@@ er@@ ons Speaker amplifier , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the non @-@ Constitution of the EU , which was then turned down by French and Dutch voters that was opened in 2005 . &quot;
the press never lost him too .
&quot; but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ ro@@ n , who gave me a friendly little liqu@@ or on his back on Monday - I said to him that he had no time left for me - seems to be repeated in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ ck Bo@@ yk@@ ott Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ s years , an error in the time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may last but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ bit@@ es &apos;s official position to Europe - I just press it out - in the development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside the U@@ ki@@ p traditional bubble @-@ tendency and the wild tra@@ des of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &apos; An Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and TV this week said that it was a boy sc@@ out of prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow map@@ le that was a poor idea . &quot;
&quot; it remin@@ ded me of the 70 &apos;s years when his old father focused on television to be loyal , loyal to his Labour cabin , without losing too far and to lose his cabin . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight in &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comra@@ de and dep@@ uties related to all the reports on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ g@@ n is to mediate , remember that he even has touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the stru@@ del of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , Cameron doesn &apos;t have to give a ticket to Europe that allowed him to keep Lab@@ ours in the speech of speech for a self @-@ comprehen@@ sion like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins starts to think so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental re@@ am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ut@@ ational economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of the es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sidents , a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes . &quot;
&quot; as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Watson , fel@@ low is convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign to the outlet , there will be foreign diplom@@ ats to try to find in everything a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they have even susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be po@@ int@@ less ?
&quot; the USA have already been quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government on power , which was a bit reminiscent of what was called the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England about e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less dam@@ aging than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , gave in Lanc@@ et to crit@@ ici@@ ze by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes in their report . &quot;
P@@ he published the &quot; Manifest@@ ation Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have put the load bearing capacity and exp@@ elled on the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ ate basis &quot; on which P@@ he established his most important conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers count in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; are built on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expect the claim that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less dam@@ aging than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement consists of a single session of 12 people who were con@@ ven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ critical criteria ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) in order to study their opinions on the damage caused by different Nik@@ ot@@ ine @-@ based products ; the results of the meeting were presented in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting has been a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director ever received from British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
he also signed the references from BA@@ T in public health in a sustainability report . they said .
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting announced to obtain funds from a e @-@ cigarettes producer , but not financing that he should have received after reports from tobacco by Philip Morris International , add them . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ um are not delivered , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also have a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the session took part also in the tobacco line of P@@ he .
&quot; the research project of the group &quot; says signi@@ fying &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; tough evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
however there are no such connections or limitations in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the alleg@@ ations made by P@@ he says that &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking are used .
&quot; pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being in P@@ he , said that he has already responded to the alleg@@ ations made by BM@@ J . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less known than smoking . &quot;
every second life smoking dies in his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low in comparison , but we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ he has had the unique level to the information of the public about what the proof was occupied , and what is not , especially when all public confusion over relative dangers are opposed to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80,000 people are dying every year on a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System £ 2 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we meet our national competence . &quot;
&quot; BBC should leave East@@ En@@ ders , the former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival &quot; would give their right arms &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the radio station should only be used to do the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ caster .
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC for doing publicly that they are public law programs , likely to be seen from a smaller audience , in hard @-@ cont@@ ested time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from sen@@ ders such as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried out for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes would have been on behalf or send them clearly by non @-@ subsi@@ dised ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the House Communications committee in the context of his analysis on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the radio station , which I do not want to do in medium or long term , one should put his production at least on programs , which do not make or order . &quot;
&quot; you send the Voice in a first @-@ class window , because they want to achieve a wide support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridic@@ ulous , it is obviously non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ ression has been financed , which can also be subsidi@@ zed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , the East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
hon@@ estly other channels would give their right arm for that .
I stri@@ ve to see how this public TV is to be public .
I don &apos;t believe this was to be reduced to the BBC .
&quot; Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , managed channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC calls on the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will give it again what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ au@@ strian talk in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell to the East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal niche programs could go to BB@@ C4 where they can &apos;t go quite the audience , but they can carry out their tasks , and they can argu@@ ed if they have created all those ob@@ sc@@ ure programmes that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; on the radio station Johnson said to the committee , &apos; I urge you to find a rather rule @-@ intensive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course , you think of course all , think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year here , but for people who is a lot of money for the € 150 , wonder if that &apos;s right , because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who , before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC check their Sab@@ th@@ ian Mission to educ@@ ate and maintain . &quot;
&quot; he said , just a little bit of the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % on the radio . and they should take part in the public @-@ legal TV stations in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC must do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only one hand@@ ful in television will be shown to make all the lines available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ etics &quot; can control brain cells by sound waves
&quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ o changes the direction at the moment , in which it is ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound imp@@ ul@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; scientists have bred worms with genetically modified organisms , controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves . &quot;
&quot; the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are used with sound imp@@ ul@@ ses who have high frequencies for the human hearing , to be heard . &quot;
imp@@ ul@@ ses are working through the switch @-@ on of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ - cells that are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ asound .
more to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called son@@ ogen@@ etics , used by ultr@@ asound , to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of a day could substitute the depths of a day , an inv@@ asive method which gives electrical imp@@ ul@@ ses to the brain of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; in general , F@@ aden@@ degra@@ mer does not react to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they were doing it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bladder , found out , strengthen the ultr@@ asound waves , that enter into the worms . &quot;
&quot; ultr@@ asound reli@@ eving effect effect on structures , called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the sausages . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves are the opening of this I@@ on@@ en@@ can@@ als and activate the cells , which they are assigned , according to a report on Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ asound controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Hal@@ as@@ ani modified the worms that some of their engines carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels . &quot;
&quot; if it has an ultr@@ asound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and transmit them into worms , where they change the modified engines . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to activate and turn neur@@ ons with imp@@ ul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ de@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics might have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that needs to be sent on an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , Low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asound Des@@ ired fabric can be imp@@ aired , and can be sent up in the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with Gen@@ therapy and a therapeutic antibody it is possible , the targeted human neur@@ ons is temporarily imp@@ ending for the ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical setup for certain neuro@@ logical treatment , &quot; said Chal@@ de@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications may concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added . &quot;

V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt Le@@ ver was astonished at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the weapons fair - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign we try to avoid .
&quot; they played with the invention of a realistic business paper , but &quot; through the blu@@ ish with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal acts of torture on the trade fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a step of the British government and guarantee that fol@@ ar devices are not illeg@@ ally tra@@ ded before our door . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student residence
&quot; eleven years ago , I moved as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old living in a student residence still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ vis@@ c@@ ism , but only now I remember the stra@@ ined smile of those who I have taken - and to the numerous , slow problems over others . &quot;
&quot; most of what I &apos;ve learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules . &quot;
the move in student dormitories is enough of a s@@ warming up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell whence you come from , whether and where you have taken the Sabbath year , where you don &apos;t love me , because in Ernst I guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask question and show interest .
&quot; de@@ fle@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out people out of the people who would not speak in contrast to those who would not speak , even if your l@@ ashes would be burned into fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers . &quot;
let people leave man .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverages recipes , film night events and municipal festiv@@ ities , but they are also the places where people wear and make their under@@ wear . &quot;
related : do not think to start with the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted intro@@ ver@@ ted a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a refuge , yet many student dormitories are a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ space @-@ culture , which is friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture can tell you , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship , but you have to go away so that I might get back the energy that I used for interaction with you . &quot;
attempt to feel when a comp@@ action of soci@@ alizing is exhausted - and send an SMS instead of knock .
you anchor to the apro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my student dormitories had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he looked some things .
friendship close by B@@ aking .
&quot; as you start the university at the cli@@ max of Back @-@ Man@@ ie , there &apos;s the pit@@ ations of the doors of people to imagine living with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked you something . so , and now please smile , when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
tasty home @-@ made treats are a good way to close friendship .
&quot; their ro@@ omm@@ ates are forced to enter@@ tain themselves , and at the end , you might have associated your face with a delicious surprise . &quot;
&quot; of course , it depends on whether you are a decent bak@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; po@@ or@@ ly mixed cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat , make them sleeping once you check . &quot;
&quot; to steal food , it is a common crime in student residence . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea ? &quot;
check this with the home@@ owners .
&quot; the chances are that they say , self @-@ served themselves , even if they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying and you have my compassion , but try to deal with balanced as my fellow lady who added her milk to the pol@@ ishing agent to pun@@ ish her th@@ ie@@ ves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should make no noise ; get away from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ ies , people are among the people sitting in the gl@@ ass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my hall asked her neighbors , if it makes them something qui@@ eter , drum &amp; bass is something qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning . &quot;
they acted on it with even more lau@@ tern music .
&quot; finally , when they stopped at 5 o &apos;clock in the morning , she had to sleep two hours before she shut down her own music , shut down her door , and came to her three hour examination . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic when your future sp@@ ouse would happen to happen in the same student residence ?
&quot; at the end , it would not be a fundamental shift if you meet a co @-@ resident of your future wife &apos;s partner in which they will have to take part and experience it every day , and perhaps , how they all join together to each common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart is going on his own way - but if a hot co @-@ hab@@ itable experience is definitely not your future wife &apos;s partner , try to tell your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has its key in its un@@ closed room , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing rather than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good fight is fun , but it just takes moments until it becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
tell us through inde@@ struc@@ ted a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but you never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
&quot; shut down her door , and place her keys into a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer , but do not sl@@ ack@@ et their homes at the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , All@@ rush , Ger@@ ing@@ er@@ operators &quot;
the property of property Markus Gil@@ dner reli@@ es in the centr@@ ist Eck@@ ental Rei@@ h@@ enh@@ agen for people who have not much money .
&quot; hence , for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the alone @-@ going mother and the g@@ ing@@ er@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show how one can still build and build well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing onto the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly the living room can be created : it builds in a project ho@@ houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr Gu@@ at@@ dner , many refugees will push in the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
&quot; Markus Gil@@ dner : the resulting accommodation in containers , or gy@@ ms , has no sustainability . &quot;
because humans remain to a great part here .
in view of the refugee flow we need a living room in the coming decades .
&quot; a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a town house needs the least square .
it facil@@ it@@ ates integration .
this is different when people are located in motor@@ homes .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees are saying it is peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is at 184 000 euros , without plot . &quot;
that is man@@ age@@ able .
construction takes six months .
that is reasonable .
do the construction rules make their plans complicated ?
Gil@@ dner : legally I submitted my project correctly .
the imp@@ ending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ worth special construction makes it especially complicated .
gr@@ un@@ chy colour .
&quot; it is still exposed , if anyone builds three apartments in a row house , needs at least three places . &quot;
only in cities the place is missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents re@@ acts to their terra@@ ced house ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely not right .
but do not tigh@@ ten the competitive advantage of affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true , however , we had a building boom in Germany in the last five years , but the luxury apartments that could hardly be able to afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living room . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the alone @-@ going mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ er@@ aman . &quot;
I &apos;ll show how one can still build and build well today .
that is why it is .

iOS 9 : how you get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update will be released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by selecting the app to &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , you will give you the option to download and then install &quot;
&quot; some are encountered after the installation , because they are getting an error message that the &quot; software update failed . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to get the problem , users recommend regularly to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght return or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .

&quot; until now I have pressed myself from gar@@ dening , now that &apos;s otherwise . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and travels . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also driven on our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; in fact , it is clear that everyone who wants to ask for asylum is that &quot; of course . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of human beings stand in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; however , it is clear that there are clear signals , &quot; the Minister said . &quot;
people have to know that we don &apos;t accept cross flow streams also not of the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border .
there need a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian Government previously announced that Slovenia would have continued to travel for refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and also cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; indeed , this interior minister of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar was not seen in Lai@@ bach ) . &quot;
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &apos; absolutely un@@ acceptable &apos; ; Slovenia would rather be the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy .
&quot; as on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already controlled by a divi@@ ding threshold of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister pointed , Sloven@@ es wants to do so its boundaries for refugees but un@@ locking . &quot;
&quot; every EU member has to fill its obligations , otherwise the system can &apos;t work , &quot; including Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees have already tried during the night hours to travel in eastern Ukraine at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to soak for registration . &quot;
the Croatian police was able to reach them in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , a police operation with new refugees have been continually met . &quot;
&quot; mainly by Syrians and Afghanistan , there are many women and children . &quot;
also emergency service and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; over the coming days , his country with some 4,000 refugees , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , minister of the Interior . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo , on the Maced@@ onian police force , had led to the Hungarian border to the Croatian border prior to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it would be to hit certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; it said . &quot;
&quot; at any rate , according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the passengers were on the way all night from the Maced@@ onian border , some 500 kilometres away . &quot;
&quot; we have heard that Hungary did so , so the police said that we are to go there , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
this might actually be the fore@@ ver@@ ed shift in the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further along the route .
Croatia : &quot; extensive options on border control &quot;
&quot; in the time , Croatia &apos;s Home Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic explained that his country had prepared corresponding plans for the case of a strong state of refugees for possible exceptional situations . &quot;
&quot; he did not name details , however , he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
one perform strict controls to qualify for the membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and the EU partners in the country have carried out a good testimony from the standard of the border controls . &quot;
&quot; on Serbian site , approximately 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border supervised by Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remains completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining fug@@ iti@@ ves to continue travelling to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
&quot; Serbian Minister of the Interior of the Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ania on Wednesday quickly participated in a local note in Hor@@ g@@ os : he kept the debates at the alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
it would not be a very high number of refugees .
&quot; could not yet say if they would continue their journey about Hungary , Croatia , or another country . &quot;
helper rates migrants - dangerous - Alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute the refugees among refugees on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing force between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the conflict there are also 20 years after the end of the conflict there are still no more cleared min@@ ef@@ ields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ers was sent to the border region .

&quot; the head of en@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hospitals is the pass@@ ers , as well as for questions and talks , as well as the volunteer workers . &quot;
&quot; while man@@ ch is access@@ ing a passive spontaneous for the chal@@ k and the sentence of &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; we can &quot; &quot; continue &quot; &quot; with the camper by the USA , &quot; &quot; stopping the war &quot; or &quot; no longer suffer , &quot; &quot; will remain short , reading , saying sentences like &quot; so far am I not &quot; and then go on . &quot;

&quot; therefore , this public @-@ efficient action was good for the 20 year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; that not everyone wants to tell everyone on the tablets , but be understand@@ able , actually it was a very personal cause . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still subject to Tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , who has contributed much to the Hosp@@ ice movement during the last few years that people can open themselves . &quot;

the offer of ambul@@ ant E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ itals is free and denomin@@ ational .

F@@ ed@@ Ex - In@@ mixed business outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last three months and the full @-@ year @-@ giant read@@ iness on a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his transport service .
&quot; the company also said that she plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this point last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
&quot; the share price fell by more than 2.5 per cent in pre @-@ market trade , 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. Announ@@ ces a $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 prize in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cents less than in the previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ kit 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower drop comes in spite of increasing price increases , which are on average 4.9 percent , and will be effective January 4 and , despite the higher prices for cross tran@@ sports of heavy and large packages , which will be imposed as of November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it would still expect the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues , and boo@@ sting growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the &quot; &quot; solid jobs &quot; &quot; will take place in weaker economic terms , especially in production and global trade , into consideration . &quot;
&quot; the plans for vacation employment have been announced one day later than the rival UPS , that is planning to present 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers like the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex remained $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;

&quot; over the past years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has enjoyed a decline in international priority shipping to stag@@ n@@ ate sales in the Express Shipping Line . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results with F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; net sales increased by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit posted higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result was a higher cost of labor in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the market trade , roughly one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares increased by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they included 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11 . &quot;

&quot; although most data of the economy are showing that they are solid growth , the latest turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets make it difficult to increase this vol@@ atility by the raising of interest for Bundes@@ land@@ bonds , and be it only by one @-@ fourth percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing that they observe , &quot; &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , leader of the farm @-@ farm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the rate of interest , the increased un@@ certainty is about the global market enough just@@ ification , continue to wait &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed is doing is conce@@ aled on itself the financial market .
&quot; approximately half of the econom@@ ists , who recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted a interest rate of interest this week . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets expect a halt by the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ an indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance to increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ist sm@@ ites the blow by promise that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial occupies an average of 21.@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policies cost the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief economist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sets at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she is doing it , she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets , so that they don &apos;t get into panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argu@@ ed that a interest rate hike would calm the financial markets , because it would immediately eliminate un@@ certainty as when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; a month before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points to this month , the first small step in a slow con@@ gest@@ ation of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; in the spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that in this year despite the problems of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the set . &quot;
&quot; even though the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level of full @-@ employment success . &quot;
wage gains have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation remained constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Representative predic@@ ts that the main reason for the temporary use of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs her because of tension in the labour market , &quot; &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ dson , Chief economist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ s.@@ com. &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets worldwide spread out all over the world , after China had rated its currency . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Dow Jones Industrial Average accounted for more than 16 % below its highest level , as investors feared that a slow@@ ing in the Chinese economy would strengthen global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has been re@@ covering in this month , yet the Dow Jones is now around 10 % below the heat of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed Representative , the market turbul@@ ence influence complex lim@@ ulation when one should increase interest . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy would not appear in the last couple of weeks , Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US database . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty on what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in deci@@ ding their decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous throughout recent years .
&quot; the only hint of that time Leit@@ ner is Ben S. Bern@@ anke in the year 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its mon@@ et@@ ical expansion &quot; , &quot; b@@ anded turbul@@ ences around the world . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly likely to inter@@ act with each other , they can not only monitor the developments in other places , but also advised by other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; the decision @-@ making is &quot; more Art in Science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted that month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story about reactions on financial market movements that apparently do not have associated with the economic fundament@@ alist data . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , a legitim@@ ate member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is one of interest @-@ rate hike , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its lead to earnings in the US by 0,@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed Representative did reverse this abbrevi@@ ation .
&quot; F@@ ed ought to only place aspects of financial stability during a serious crisis as the market collapse in 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en , a former member of the Committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the most recent turbul@@ ence do not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to come into the situation in which she finds fear of interest rate , because the markets felt exciting , &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and mentioned not the financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not believe that they should release the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Life Assi@@ stance to refugees
more refugees arrive during these days in Germany .
&quot; to prepare a warm welcome , do not go as a volunteer without the commitment . &quot;
&quot; too , in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ un@@ profitable asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
&quot; to them , Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them . &quot;
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher and soul teacher .
&quot; with its 74 L@@ akes , it still teaches us . &quot;
every Thursday they are doing it in the asylum seek@@ er by D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; there , they help refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
of course it &apos;s quite different to be taught at a right school .
Brazil &apos;s p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande cares for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian sp@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to clarify how important good nutrition is during the breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies , which are painted with presentations of un@@ healthy food . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers will have their daily cal@@ orie intake to increase approximately 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only diabe@@ tic adaptation that should be carried out as mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent survey conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ina sports hall
the Municipal Council approved the building application for the 2.3 million euros in expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ made turn@@ outs on the amber grounds are going forward step forward : in the recent municipal court there was a worked tree application without large discussions .
&quot; before that , the panel among other things had agreed a request for an open &quot; respec@@ tiv@@ ation &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; exception &quot; we went to permit a special form in terms of roof construction . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ conduc@@ tive first and roof super@@ structure should be erected . &quot;
&quot; in the background , the planned use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; as a result , we get a wonderfully large South Tyro@@ lean roof together , &quot; Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger stated in his session . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Liberation , &quot; there was another tile @-@ ti@@ lt , prescribed for energetic reasons - unlike the building plan is supposed to be below ten degrees . &quot;
&quot; thus , the volume of the hall is considerably reduced . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; was necessary because the development plan in terms of the roof cut no &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ina Ter@@ der@@ at generally uses restri@@ ctive cases to liberation contracts . &quot;
&quot; however , it is no recur@@ ring project with gy@@ ms : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym is ge@@ aring construction on sports centre is a community for community and S@@ V Bern@@ ward .
&quot; at costs , approximately 2.3 million euros are recorded . &quot;
supplements are expected from the school@@ - and lat@@ itude racing .
&quot; the construction application for the 18 x 36 metre hall is now presented to the land Council , where the building is presented . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ mi@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station as well as the majority of employees take from P@@ ei@@ mi@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this will see the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district court , the district of Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
&quot; the Supervisory Board does not meet this decision , and this will take place on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were implemented , all the barely 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ mi@@ berg . &quot;
the overwhelming majority should be moved with fishermen and the further existing on station to s@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees who can not operate with ong@@ au , should be offered a work@@ space in W@@ eil@@ heim , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees are informed about the plans .
&quot; triggered the change the resignation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year , and is now transferred to a private practice near the hospital . &quot;
&quot; on the question of who will succeed , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into the game who declared itself ready to take line as of 1 October , and to switch to his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
for the house in Sh@@ ong@@ au this means an &quot; appreciation &quot; and a spread of the offer in the field of Internal Medicine &apos; thus J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
T@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alizes in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; as a result of the next two years , Fischer said to his team , if the Supervisory Board is to agree , both houses will lead until the next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ ap@@ an , which still has 35 beds , is scheduled to finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( almost 140 years ) . &quot;
&quot; so far , the district had planned that in 2018 , when the current renovation work at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital is complete . &quot;
&quot; landing in J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board , went out to indicate that the house that is owned by the federal government in future is to be used as an accommodation for asylum . &quot;
&quot; I close this . as with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there were several consider@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; currently , a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a hi@@ de@@ sych@@ iat@@ ric is housed there . &quot;
&quot; what better could happen to us , an opportunity didn &apos;t happen again , &quot; Fischer said about the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; impressed by the staff &quot; &quot; and very understand@@ able . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , where the fisher@@ man has worked as che@@ ator for over 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take up the post of medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was always threatened by closure in recent decades , part@@ ments were closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hands of the Rhein @-@ Neckar @-@ Neckar are called tonight at the Berg@@ ischer HC ( 20.@@ 15 in the evening ) .
&quot; in Wuppertal the league leader in the Bundesliga , though , is indeed the clear it@@ ite , occasion of the su@@ bl@@ ance , there is none . &quot;
in the past season the bath@@ ers covered a painful defeat at the B@@ HC and have a little bun@@ ni@@ fe there .
Jag@@ ev@@ incident with two injured people at Pr@@ at@@ au
two Tra@@ ctor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday morning .
during Aber@@ deen on a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( Landkreis Witt@@ enberg ) there were several hunters in use as the police ra@@ ced .
&quot; after a gun passed , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought into hospitals . &quot;
&quot; as it could come to the accident , the first was un@@ clear . &quot;
the criminal police established .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violence
a crime susp@@ ects has brought the police to the bodies of the Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate for Saturday since Saturday .
&quot; in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 year old has been killed , the young@@ sters killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in rock breaks . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate is missing on Saturday . a violent crime fall victim .
the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found on Tuesday night in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern as public prosecutor and police on Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; as a tat@@ too @-@ susp@@ ect , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old man , who in fact led to the statement , led to the investigation and investig@@ ators to the discovery of the bodies . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning after she was not going to go home on the eve of the eve of a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; in search of young women , investig@@ ators first threw investig@@ ators in personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in case of question@@ ing in the friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the Ver@@ mi@@ sts , there was a susp@@ ect against the 20 year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the suspected perpet@@ rators brought the police into one channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the bodies were found . &quot;
&quot; the police captured the authorities , according to the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 16 year old was killed , and the bodies have been put into the canal . &quot;
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old man should be led to the harbour in front of the harbour ; investig@@ ators appeal to him .
in fact the further investigation should bring about the further investigation .
refugees need accommodations : study warns of housing
the situation on the German residential market is un@@ mistak@@ able .
&quot; also , more refugees seek a paid stay . &quot;
the pressure on residential property is growing .
the social housing is a challenge .
the distribution battle on the German housing market has long been started .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job seeking from the EU , more people push for a market , which is now over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with revenue citizens in the last affordable apartments .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for paid homes , 400,000 new units would have to be built up by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; in this result , a study commissioned by the &quot; social housing &quot; was commissioned . &quot;
&quot; to compare , 260@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , 14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many stum@@ ble onto the housing market and rows in the long qu@@ eu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to Statist@@ ical Office in last year , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers used to rent . &quot;
the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant incid@@ ents in residential construction of recent years .
Germany kick @-@ up a residential deficit here to get bigger from year to year .
&quot; currently , some 77@@ 0.000 residential units are missing in the metro@@ politan areas and compl@@ ains by Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals were living in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed un@@ necessarily stay in &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; due to the fl@@ au@@ te on residential market .
&quot; in the major cities , the number of square metres per capita has decreased for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; social housing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot . &quot;
new inc@@ enti@@ ves are to stim@@ ulate the social housing for social housing .
&quot; thus , the property taxes may be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for funded flats will be suspended . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the alliance continue to have attractive anticip@@ ation options according to the Alliance . &quot;
the funding programme for refugees of the Kf@@ W state bank - now well attended by cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start was at Monday evening with 184 million euros , more than half of the population at disposal were already called approximately 300 million euros . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia : corridor
&quot; after Hungary is practically no coming , there will always be more refugees to go over the road to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but dangerous is the route still .
Croatia wants to have an agreement with Slovenia &apos;s neighbour bar on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Slovenian Minister of Interior , and if it is necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen Area .
&quot; after the extermination of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have broken off after Croatia to get to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV RTL survey reports . &quot;
Hungary had blocked its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; law procedures , which came into force on the same day , are practically unnecessary to consider legal asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to allow refugees to happen .
the Croatian Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic declared : &quot; you can travel through and we are ready to prepare for this opportunity .
&quot; these people are there , there are women , kids and men who want to live and do something . &quot;
&quot; however , people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police had taken the first refugee on the morning of Serbia &apos;s borders to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
&quot; most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they both came by bus and taxi in the Serb bor@@ der@@ city of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they had tried to get into the green border to Croatia . &quot;
the refugee within the Croatian @-@ Serbian border do not encounter the refugees .
this poses the border with dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ ef@@ ields will now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after the closure of the border , however , there are hardly any refugees . &quot;
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 thr@@ ott@@ le people .
&quot; just before the Tor@@ sion on Monday , it was still 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy the over@@ win@@ ing and damage of the Grenz@@ en@@ e@@ us as an off@@ ender .
35 criminal proceedings were instit@@ uted in the southern Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
&quot; sentences ranging from prison sentences , up to five years and the deportation from the country . &quot;
&quot; according to the Immig@@ ration Authority on Tuesday , the &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sit@@ ons &quot; &quot; were in re@@ faced with 94 asylum applications on Tuesday , of which nearly all - 93 - the main transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicant , 13 families with small children and two older people . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees recorded .
&quot; however , no one has any more views than granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be deported there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sessions &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees . &quot;
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers started to get around . &quot;
they gathered the tr@@ ash to leave the tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks .
pl@@ ating lat@@ ti@@ ces were min@@ ed and one of the hop@@ per in the border was rebuilt .
&quot; to the goal of this reconstruction , nobody wanted to express itself . &quot;
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria remains only a few refugees . &quot;
this country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; in about 20,000 migrants , however , the population remained in the country . &quot;
in Salzburg approximately 1400 people are waiting for the drive to Germany .
the traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the German authorities .
&quot; in Freil@@ assing , smaller groups of refugees met on foot . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; &quot; Y@@ esterday &quot; &quot; on the border
&quot; we were engaged to the bridge on Sunday with the ti@@ dings when there were suddenly ten people with rice off@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ ern@@ i mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists arriving by train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; because Germany had stopped the railway traffic on Sunday due to the refugee flow in Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein in conclusion , &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and stri@@ ped with two other helicop@@ ters and their cars over the border into the Na@@ he Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before that , we have prepared the un@@ trusted guests only once , with snack and beverages . &quot;
we said right now . we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; and that &apos;s of course &quot; , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man refused to take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this is very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in W@@ els moved from a ICE in W@@ els from a train to the direction of Pass@@ au , at the short time the railway traffic was stopped in Germany to try the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was completed ahead of the hotel in W@@ ern@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border cross @-@ border is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the bridge firm linked with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , before a two @-@ bridge cent@@ ric sports - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
the Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now send thousands of thousands of thousands to us - a logical result of a apparent in@@ let policy :
&quot; instead of helping in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp at the establishment of structures help Human@@ ity , our Federal Chancellor offers highly officially and publicly tra@@ ced the attitude of the Hungarian government into the circle of National Socialism . &quot;
suffering from this policy are not only those Austrian who are now confron@@ ted in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; the refugee leaders must also realize that the &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish land , &quot; which she has invited and welcome , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; a major challenge shall be faced , in view of the continued refugee flow and the approaching wind , in which decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers produce . &quot;
&quot; and there will be one more bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad on the quest to 35.000 winter@@ ly Qu@@ arti@@ facts
Konrad has filled all the hands with the refugees to do so .
Christian Konrad : it &apos;s usual that his word has weight .
the government is set up with Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ Ban@@ ker for the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank for thousands of refugees .
&quot; the chaos at the first call centre in Tra@@ is@@ kir@@ k , Konrad has already received the handle . &quot;
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great host , &quot; Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; master power . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the interior of the Interior , however , spoke of a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in all , Konrad , with a need of 8@@ 5,000 quot@@ as are expecting in the he@@ ur@@ igen year . &quot;
&quot; in order to fulfill the number , 35,000 properties must still be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 are expected to provide the amount of 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without the ground , &quot; Konrad . &quot;
&quot; with the Landes@@ haupt@@ werk , he already led talks . &quot;
&quot; they had promised him , even for the coming refugees Qu@@ arti@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it goes well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ et supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Scho@@ born and will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
great expectations of the asylum Coordin@@ ator will also set up the ORF action &quot; Help like us . &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodation . &quot;
&quot; it is also hop@@ ed for hotels , which are empty in winter . &quot;
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high &quot; yesterday .
&quot; in emer@@ gen@@ cies , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ellor must have a certain amount of the towel holders or size of the tops . &quot;
for a temporary time &quot; staff standards &quot; would apply .
&quot; in contrast to the Interior Ministry of the Interior when the accommodation is successful , Konrad , with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an elderly Lord , whom one cannot find the un@@ tru@@ ths without further face . &quot;
his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause no cost as they used themselves .
your head@@ count will be increased to three to four .
the own Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ase was not yet successful yet .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz needs a better division
&quot; first , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and design centre for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary due to the reasons promp@@ ted by the parties without these measures , the mayor of Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) says . &quot;
&quot; in case of emergency , further sites should be checked on their capability . &quot;
critic@@ ised by the municipal executive at the division of refugees among the federal state .
other districts also need to contribute to their contribution .
See@@ hofer : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) announced further demonstrations in refugee space on Monday . &quot;
See@@ hofer gave me as@@ sures that the German borders are not blocked .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany would continue to be possible .
however there is now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
&quot; however , the scope @-@ seek@@ ers would however be transported by regular trains to Germany . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger demanded more reinforced solidarity in the refugees . &quot;
&quot; as well as Austria continues to inspec@@ t inspec@@ tions again in Austria , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger is a logical consequence &quot; from the subur@@ b of Germans . &quot;
the nearest Run@@ t@@ astic is a Question of Time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Werft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial line is officially completed .
&quot; in four out of the six floors of office and production buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) , is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; it could imagine , invest in the start@@ up companies of the New ship@@ yard and later also in action . &quot;
&quot; already from the out@@ set , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - a lot of which is promising : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the facility , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which one part of the center of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is char@@ tered from the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
&quot; 30 per cent of the 2700 square metres of rest in the building are already let , for another 40 per cent of in@@ quiries . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the arcade
there are fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags in the new shop .
actually J@@ utta Bre@@ a wanted to join a dog .
&quot; this project had to shift the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ market @-@ Ark@@ ham , which ultimately became an increase in the form of another business@@ man . &quot;
&quot; at the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop compared to the business , in which they sold bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , now everything revol@@ ves around ladies pur@@ ses of the Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are sold from 75 Euro . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
&quot; before , several weeks were rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I &apos;m thinking about whether I am going to open a shop , says Bre@@ a . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the decision was made , amongst others , that the Fur@@ la @-@ producers , which are at home from the idea of a company &apos;s own location , where only their hand@@ bags are sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only artists in the Great Room of Linz , which sell that brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters that even holds Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion @-@ interest has been given a cra@@ dle from her mom in the cra@@ dle .
&quot; I feel most , when something developed and I can show up new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why such a woman , looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in a tran@@ ce , can not answer the specialist . &quot;
perhaps it is about to look up a beautiful bag of every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the P@@ fäl@@ zer@@ os ancest@@ or of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a village whose residents are called An@@ ders . &quot;
this property also links the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become U.S. president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; if he comments on the foreign host@@ ilities , the journalists are concerned or knowledge g@@ aps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. Presi@@ dential Agency sp@@ ends the election campaign . &quot;
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the p@@ fal@@ si@@ cal city of K@@ all@@ stadt where there are three real estate markets .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a concept for many in the wine region .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant place is related to -@@ spicy corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather arrived from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow exciting , but in their dental type , they weren &apos;t so deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone L@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous spr@@ inkl@@ es , as well as the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz as well . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too , with the statement that he would also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; to the king of the hearts , he did not make it there . &quot;
&quot; indeed , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ dencies is that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of great la@@ zy as well , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; co@@ incid@@ entally , the nickname E@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher is in a circum@@ ference , called &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in high German : the investors , says she . &quot;
&quot; so , Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of An@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;@@ sche success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers . &quot;
the foundation stone of the estate company were first plot in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to life , failed on the Bavarian state to which the Palat@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; he did not regulate Tr@@ ump , because he was once approved without hom@@ olog@@ ation , was the director of the Institute for p@@ fal@@ si@@ cal History and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , for film launch . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rants . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ ochondri@@ al statements of the desc@@ endant .
he had repeatedly discussed the United States of immigrants in the US and requested the construction of a mar@@ g@@ inal dam to loc@@ ust illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the pol@@ isher , it &apos;s not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , Op@@ a was born to his own Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the wine is reti@@ ring , the Americans dist@@ anced rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is still so hum@@ bled . &quot;
do you believe that Tr@@ ump happens ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never looked after K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the financial administrator of Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm menti@@ ons such as the K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz @-@ family came to a visit in a visit to the church organ which is general well .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from the Donald House , the 68 year old says . &quot;
&quot; it is better if he does not gain the choice , because &quot; he has such a radical views , I don &apos;t know if it is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had their grandfather at the time of his grandfather in the US , would have been like he , &quot; he wouldn &apos;t have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ a Sarah Bü@@ hler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; W@@ end@@ els film , interviewed for the tr@@ ump long , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ utes , also in the US akes the interest . &quot;

&quot; this dis@@ advantage of the insur@@ rection seemed to play any role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise has posted an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators in the five capit@@ als , in comparison with Today 33@@ 9,000 . &quot;
&quot; today the Today scored a slight increase on ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its figure remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;

the great novel@@ ty for seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seri@@ enst@@ ar of the Raf@@ to the Raf@@ ser Erik Thomson .
&quot; the new drama on a more swe@@ ated father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , got a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics have asked whether Thomson had a hit show solo without the Rap@@ tor Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with a crowd of 1.@@ 136 million and struck slightly The block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results on the evening two of The Chase Australia .
&quot; the first half @-@ hour ( 17 : 00 to 17,@@ 30 ) the new qui@@ z @-@ show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe , gave an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
the second half @-@ hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Chase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour full 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
hot @-@ se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20.000 .
a drop in the quot@@ as during the second evening of The Chase Australia will proof that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately succeed at 17 : 30 .

the last three voices transc@@ ended : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
un@@ exposed secrets ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ ov@@ ki may possibly have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , finally put in at The Bachelor &apos;s , has been ham@@ mer@@ ed in the world &apos;s largest intelligence agency . &quot;
&quot; and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not return , whether they are the one who received the last Rose . &quot;
&quot; but when we with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ ov@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three , they may be accid@@ entally given a hint on who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women got out in the ly@@ rical way , why there is the perfect man and we called his sense of humor , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as a reason why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get the last rose ? &quot; &quot; could their answers to the game @-@ destro@@ ying , who won the heart of the bach@@ elor &apos;s heart . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ ov@@ ki called them both fast - except themselves - Mack@@ ay as best partner in Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I entered into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ i &apos;s energies , I sens@@ ed that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah sees at both feet on Earth , making it so much fun with her , &quot; added Mark@@ ov@@ ki . &quot;
I &apos;ve seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
&quot; from their point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the last week of the house made her clear that Wood can be &quot; one . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I &apos;m currently standing at it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; when she was asked to choose who Wood should choose if she was , she was en@@ ig@@ matic . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - there is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor &apos;s will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 on Wednesday . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA , and there were lots of other teams that sent qu@@ eries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year . &quot;
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
&quot; some train@@ ers have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game , when he lost a fre@@ er , as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by League Con@@ struc@@ tions on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot;
&quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted her husband , and gave Hay@@ ne &apos;s next opportunity to a Pun@@ t Return and also into the ongoing play after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
&quot; instead of making his ro@@ ok@@ ies to grinding the mill by the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne &apos;s public in his press conference after the play .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ bag In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special care coordinator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ he@@ y , who advised him to forget his pat@@ inated catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne patented at a punch that was restored in the first quarter of Minnesota &apos;s Vik@@ ings
&quot; certainly , it was certainly not the start to the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian success for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field and talked about the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could no wor@@ sen@@ ing start into his N@@ FL career &quot;
&quot; this was a thing which happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne sc@@ ared his work with his Origin , back in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area became a T@@ ry for Queensland . &quot;

the Sunday Division of Free voters is held until Friday in the Mali@@ an Commun@@ e .
other main themes were actually fore@@ seen .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free voters meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of Asyl@@ um on Ret@@ re@@ at , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ w@@ anger demanded the establishment of the UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it did during the Yugoslavia during the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it is not possible , we need to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free Ge@@ hler Chef . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to slide free voters as fast as possible .
&quot; so , Ai@@ w@@ anger demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; the FW @-@ boss critic@@ ised that several states are not consistent : &quot; we need the nationwide uniform standards of the states . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria p@@ ushes , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to be more effective . &quot;
but the state politics should not fall under the table under the table .
a year @-@ old free tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the education policy .

&quot; but that goes wrong , Ai@@ w@@ anger is not far enough . &quot;
&quot; the theme of G9 has to be accelerated , &quot; said the FW Chef . &quot;
we call for freedom of freedom for all the Gym@@ n@@ asi@@ ums that do .
&quot; free travel to the G9 anywhere , where it is desired . &quot;

&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;

&quot; he is also afraid of some other project critics that the traffic could grow strong due to the stated size of the plant , &quot; &quot; all the bus charges must come , so that would be &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;

there is no operators yet .

Google will start collecting donations in earning $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation to the United Nations to help thousands of refugees forced thousands of refugees trying to over@@ roll thousands of refugees , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to dis@@ closure of donations in his blog .
&quot; instead of leaving a manager on the announcement , Rita Mass@@ oud wrote , a Google employee who had fled to Kabul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; on our trip there were many dark lines and bus@@ cru@@ ises , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but as the refugee and migrants crisis grew in Europe , many people look desper@@ ately for help as my family . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : rescue without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / , called to $ 11 million . &quot;
&quot; Europe is confron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , distributed over 4 million people this year . &quot;

coverage of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; adaptation of Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for slightly ob@@ ese diabe@@ tics can be helpful without loss of weight loss surgery .
&quot; the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ grown people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years , after a new study . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s still too early to say , whether lightly ob@@ ese people with diabetes after weight loss surgery lived longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery which wrote a leading article to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A . &quot;
weight loss surgery or Adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ surgery ; use different methods to reduce the size of stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to include food .
&quot; over the years Adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ operative treatment for the treatment of type 2 diabetes proved efficient , but most studies were conducted with people who are ob@@ ese ob@@ ese ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BMI , a certain size of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of Adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ surgery - Mag@@ enb@@ ypass and gast@@ ric ul@@ sing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes , who were easily over@@ looked . &quot;
&quot; the average BMI of those who underwent this operation , fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the BMI of those who do not cure surgical treatments received approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among the survivors of the surgical procedure , 36 % dis@@ b@@ anded the diabetes condition and is at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , Diabetes dissolved just a few percent compared to that of the diabetes , and in some cases , only around 2 percent . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the outcomes in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyceri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ins &apos; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
researchers also supervised the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood glucose levels throughout the period .
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held by 7 percent , writing the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reducing the mortality in five years , thus the guiding researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also looked the average results with the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and reached larger return trips in the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete expul@@ sion of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 14.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of severe people in Sweden that surgery will lead to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was subjected to obesity people who underwent a obesity operation , about 29 percent less probably in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that had conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; even though the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery @-@ patients , Black@@ stone stated that it was a so@@ othing for people who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that humans and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , once the patient sits between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have accumulated their body with obesity and diabetes , is an in@@ version really hard . &quot;

&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ r@@ ens readers , because he plays in Lang@@ er and the surrounding villages . &quot;

it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe could not take up all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide encouraged people to end violence in the refugees of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the last refugee crisis in the beginning of his 10 day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford devoted to ethics studies .
&quot; he demanded that under the circumstances of humanity , the interests of humanity must be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
&quot; he also emphas@@ ized that the response of Western European countries would be ad@@ mi@@ red to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama &apos;s efforts in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to overcome the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but meanwhile you must re@@ think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education to be created by these Muslim nations . &quot;
&quot; finally , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 , 2001 , that the violent reaction of the USA passed a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know , his moti@@ fs were good , but he put violence ; and this was due to unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four@@ fold increase of taking @-@ disinf@@ ection by children over the last 4 years
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ ation centres in the U.S. will report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , who have strongly added alcoholic drinks , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue feed supplies in children under 12 years were reported that pois@@ oning control centres increased from 3,@@ 268 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go up in the not@@ ch , &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children disinf@@ ect@@ ant drink , while some do , to im@@ press their friends , or because of a mutation of the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young@@ sters drink only because of an inexpensive experience .
you@@ ths have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with non @-@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be rock@@ ed by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are par@@ ked .
&quot; there is disinf@@ ect@@ ant with strawberry , grapes and or@@ anges that are very appe@@ aling to children . &quot;
hanging disinf@@ ect@@ ant contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
a few injec@@ tions can already lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Emer@@ gency Medical Center in Kansas City Hospital , the broad@@ caster Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let whis@@ key around , but people let this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant occur in reach of children , and when children come on it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four syr@@ inge from following the earthquake disinf@@ ection apparatus , was taken into a not@@ ion for treatment . &quot;
&quot; blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold which was legally considered for adults , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a medical professional doctor who treated them in the G@@ win@@ dy Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laughed at her words , and was not able to go when she arrived in her not@@ hing@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; doctors looked at her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at Sign@@ s of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and bent his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; it was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ cip@@ her mother , CNN . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has advised parents and teachers to use non@@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ant products outside the child &apos;s range .
&quot; beyond alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were connected with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario , following the swal@@ lowing of cord @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , which contains a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities assume that the product meth@@ anol contained a fatal solution , instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , was noted as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January the three students of the fourth class in the state of New York to pois@@ oned her &quot; &quot; woman &quot; &quot; in order to con@@ struct anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , so it reports a police report . &quot;
&quot; the teacher is highly allergic against hanging disinf@@ ect@@ ant , and utterly destroyed them out of their room . &quot;
the police considered the s@@ worn plan as &quot; Sh@@ un@@ amm@@ z &quot; and referred the measures to the School of Education .

&quot; today de Bo@@ er , a ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they do not show highlights of Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the old Fir@@ m .
&quot; they talk about both teams , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re interested . &quot;
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see those games .
I will turn things around and swe@@ ars D@@ eila .

now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel right there - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need support Cel@@ tic , because that makes the players better . &quot;

&quot; the players who come in the summer will have this pre@@ season time to integrate , what you have seen with our own group in this season . &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises in the UK .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period from May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom had increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 per cent was over 5.5 % , according to the statistics of the National Statistics Office ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , in Scotland , during the three months , the number of employees fell to 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland was 7@@ 4.0 percent , representing a figure above the annual UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; commenting on the recent figures , the State Secretary of Scotland said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan for the government laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
&quot; almost exactly one year ago , Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom . &quot;
&quot; for these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I witness to be a execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection . &quot;
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
&quot; the invitation only took place for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agree . &quot;
&quot; when the day approached , I began to fear . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
&quot; I agree , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it &apos;s true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applicants than seats , find a simple lot@@ tery to decide who is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; who will be selected , who will observe emotional . &quot;
I cannot do that .
&quot; in addition to Richard Glos@@ s@@ ps , I &apos;m sitting next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to record a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just need to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter to im@@ pose my im@@ parti@@ ality .
this is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants , and you get access . &quot;
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; they admitted that &quot; it could have been better to form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks that it is false , what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can always remove me from his list of witnesses .
&quot; however , he wants an international reporter to be present to write . &quot;
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter from Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen the series of Podcasts that I have done . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ats would make him guilty of being a substitute in action .
but I believe a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
certainly I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I &apos;ll see him die .
I can not claim to be objec@@ tively .
there will be other rep@@ orters to which you can contact .
&quot; what you get from me is what it means , a man to die unnecessary death . &quot;

&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long forgotten about it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything goes out again , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
you know it was going on .
&quot; sometimes one re@@ acts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I &apos;ll go home tonight and sleep well tonight .
&quot; I want to move around my head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had brought the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , ensuring that the Integr@@ ity division had attempted to pi@@ onate to his stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Terry Bailey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sitting in a room with a man - whom I am going to call him to provide information about what I was doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
apparently you realize that I am an im@@ bur@@ gers .
&quot; if that &apos;s the case , they certainly should pick up their n@@ oses because they are trying to deal with me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former President of Route L , David Moo@@ dy , current CEO of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , has become the current CEO of Route L , and are still alive today . &quot;
should it take me to the view that it is personally recommended ?
&quot; does the RV@@ L celebrate itself , and perhaps people are responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
&quot; you may have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say was about to think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but now I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that really makes me sad .
&quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them , and pushing them to make a decision . &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the spring levels of the train@@ ers have built a long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt @-@ examination at Li@@ dar@@ i and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to that he could throw at his licence on the table .
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ stable Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the day @-@ day treatment as &quot; ridic@@ ulous &quot; after a package of mud or clay on the legs had been applied , which viol@@ ates the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing , too . &quot;
&quot; I have to take over the full responsibility , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; one of my collabor@@ ators has lifted up mud on your leg .
it would have been that last night .
it would have been like yesterday all the day so what was the case .
but it had also so on the day of the racing day .
Moo@@ dy could be confron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack of the racing day . an investigation of the matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
&quot; people , who commit these rules , know nothing about the horse . &quot;
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot;
man to Driver &apos;s arrested

&quot; the cycl@@ ist was delivered with a helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious bre@@ aches , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Murray @-@ Valley highway . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy strikes back to Ri@@ vals because of claims for claims
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has been critic@@ ised on the tac@@ kling his player as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Robinson Roo@@ ster Robinson said that the judges of the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring fights with its team during the high @-@ rise triumph during the qualifying finals in Sydney were allowed on Friday night .
&quot; Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Bennett made an hardly conce@@ aled note to the Storm @-@ Team , after his crew had finished the Final victory against North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game &quot; &quot; Ex@@ ample &quot; &quot; of the Rug@@ by League , saying that the two from Queensland did not play &quot; at good &quot; in rings . &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the cra@@ dle of his crew and told that it is only concentr@@ ating on her &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers on his team are confident , since it means worried about to be beaten by the Storm @-@ Team . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s always up - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring@@ ing , when they have struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our heart@@ y @-@ intensive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and this has provided a turn@@ around for us . &quot;
Tr@@ ent was there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not getting used to lose it so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is com@@ ical as it always appears at this time of time .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and rec@@ alls its ment@@ or that Benn@@ ops St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons has won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he was compared to his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting her play was &apos; she told Bell@@ amy .
&quot; I remember that in 2010 , St George was crit@@ ici@@ zed for a boring team , and Wayne said that he would take care of himself a sh@@ ud@@ dle . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially its young players with their speed . &quot;
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this testimony in 2010 , now he wants all of playing his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they play . &quot;
I have stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about to play against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t remember when it was about the big Games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster represents an higher result than the game of bronze against co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is it an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and no points of fi@@ xation ?
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; if they mentioned us , it means that we will be able to meet them in a phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm @-@ Team is free at this weekend because they won the right , either North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday night in the final morning at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will start next Tuesday tomorrow . &quot;
Serbia with $ 200,000 worth of deposit to drug ad@@ versaries &quot;
&quot; a man who possibly suffered a li@@ fel@@ ong punishment owing to his attempt to get the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , who had been filled by Queensland , was released on a $ 200,000 deposit . &quot;
&quot; Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police arrested 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , arrived from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite his potentially life sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , argu@@ ing that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole multitude , and that in the cafe could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; on the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned about the risk of floo@@ ding at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia and he declared the court on Wednesday .
&quot; in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police over his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics &apos;s mother and step@@ mother , offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to have his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a safety of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Richter fl@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but it will not be enough to hold him out of that , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on deposit , released on the basis of the conditions that he announces his Australian and Serbian Pass to leave the police on a daily basis at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

&quot; H@@ og@@ g then said to the officials that he did it , because it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet &quot; and then &quot; he gave &quot; to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot;
&quot; the State lawyer E@@ ili@@ ie Robertson said to the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction - that he is addic@@ tive to people to sc@@ are people . &quot;
&quot; he gave us that the search was carried out on the computer of him , but said that it was done , because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten the ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send any more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce her .

&quot; MS Robertson adds : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother , and was weeping and weeping . &quot;
she then saw the accused images on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants .

slo@@ user soft to small border trans@@ itions in Germany
more and more refugees are attacked by the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
&quot; many locks were made of fear , and capture man with smaller border trans@@ itions &quot;
&quot; out on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man on the Federal Police stated . &quot;
along the border of our Inn Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al Inn since Tuesday more than 1000 refugees were taken over .
they were walking on foot and bridges on the German side .
there they are used by federal polic@@ emen in reception and re@@ directed to registration .
&quot; following the weekend of the first time in the Munich Central Station , more refugees met again in the Munich Central Station . &quot;
&quot; around 700 people arrived in the regional capital alone until 8@@ am , speaking one speaker in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , the city reached the city on Tuesday in 17@@ 59 . &quot;

the mass makes it : every two years the car park at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , primarily women who sell itself is particularly well on the market of the compact car . &quot;
cars in the compact class are particularly high demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ strations were sold out according to the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is reflected at the International Motor Show ( Public@@ ation date 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models are presented in this year between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German Autobahn project is the Opel Astra at the beginning of the dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
the new Astra is also not much more expensive for it to do so .
&quot; Opel presents a entry level below the biggest compet@@ itor VW Golf in the prospec@@ t , starting at around 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra will cost from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 2.0 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
the H@@ esse also offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp which also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is initially only fifth of the Opel Astra . &quot;
&quot; as a second variant , the station w@@ agon will follow in the spring of the station . &quot;
and what is driven by the Astra at the International Motor Show on the International Motor Show ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra compet@@ itor to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only five @-@ weekend in a conventional and a st@@ resses sports GT version . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , the trade is coming , as a com@@ bi . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : quite new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ branch wishes to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
&quot; in doing so , the compact Infin@@ iti with its wav@@ y lines fits perfectly to the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the base model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot;
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which makes its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a new developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer data .

J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters are human beings
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a former in@@ mate of the Te@@ gel for a prisoner who has housed many months in a small cell .
&quot; because of the violation of their human rights , prisoners were basically entit@@ ling to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in too small cells . &quot;
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , the parties could even hope for the judges , if they were imprisoned only a few days in the adjacent spaces ( z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with around five square metres of ground space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
&quot; afterwards , the man , who once again found himself on the loose foot in his lawyer , had been re@@ located to a larger cell . &quot;
his mandate penalty was due to the un@@ mistak@@ able detention conditions against the State of Berlin .
but the constitutional judge took up the verdict of the Berlin chamber of Berlin and refused to return to the repeated test .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; although legal reasons for frag@@ ile reasons were decisive for the compensation period just a few days of work for the compensation , it was a compensation . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; to worry about the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the Chamber of Appeal should now clarify the amount of money damage .
the constitutional judge often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; so they did not say until April of a det@@ ain@@ ee of damages , because he was imprisoned in the cell in a cell . &quot;
&quot; human un@@ worthy is , according to a decision from 2011 , and the multi @-@ occup@@ anc@@ akes of a cell is without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , a prisoner of a prisoner in a parallel incident in November 2009 , also confirmed a decent housing . &quot;
the former pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff has taken place every three months a day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell like in the Karlsruhe company .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have returned to the head@@ lines in recent weeks .
&quot; prisoners are therefore shut down for 23 hours , aggressi@@ veness increases , even to stro@@ kes , it should have happened because of the conflic@@ ting situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the judicial service , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of young talent , 19 are to be removed out in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
the refugees of refugees is an enormous challenge - Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to the guidance of the Federal Ministry of Germany in this year , approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany , according to the Vice President Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) to be able to take one million refugees . &quot;
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again , &quot; We can do this , and we can do it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; what comes to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
we will go to different forecasts ranging from 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of housing is dramatic , but especially for paid rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments come out of the lease agreement , and in order to apply these especially favourable sites . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister for Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore aims to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is this from the point of view of the Pest@@ el @-@ Institute : 80 000 social apartments annually would have to emerge and , for this , the federal government would have to invest a level of 6.4 billion per year . &quot;
scientists and the Federal Minister also agree that there must be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Voc@@ ational Research , 55 percent of the employers in Germany can be employed . &quot;
&quot; however , in Germany , refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically in their qualification to help them , with Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
&quot; however , for the integration of refugees , however , it is decisive whether they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key for social contacts , for appreciation in the recording @-@ group , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , the migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt says . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political change@@ over : from labour ban on refugees for the recognition of labour . &quot;
&quot; in November 2014 , while there was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers for asylum seek@@ ers , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ du@@ z@@ ations required to asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the lack of professionals - it has consistently controlled the visibility that refugees must be made faster in the labor market . &quot;
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German @-@ language skills .
&quot; until now , there is no further offer to the general and professional language courses . &quot;
research also show that work@@ places are commonly communic@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; under the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the Royal Path has become the job integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only few vol@@ atile parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the root of their parents , Il@@ ja cos@@ chem@@ y , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; however , in order to convince the family to convince the benefits of K@@ ita &apos;s benefits , the hand@@ outs are shared in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need of educ@@ ators are strongly increased by the large number of refugees , the Senate would try to increase training capacity by more technical colle@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students are prepared in welcome groups in welcome groups . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always trained by teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have an qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ acks from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
&quot; the German student union estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study in Germany . &quot;
&quot; in principle , no Austrian asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ul@@ ted study - the only exception was to Berlin , internal si@@ dep@@ uties Frank Henkel ( CDU ) now has abandoned its post@@ ure . &quot;
study consent to refugees may be facil@@ itated access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ ce do not receive any benefits after asylum seek@@ ers law , when they start a study . &quot;
&quot; in principle , they get no fr@@ af@@ ö@@ G as they do not fall under the circle of the valid people . &quot;
&quot; the refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ G @-@ authorized , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months from January 1 , 2016 . &quot;
&quot; however , this funding gap must also be closed , for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German student union . &quot;
the students should immediately receive B@@ af@@ ö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will in future play a more important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , the religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should res@@ emble Islam as succ@@ essively the same rights as they have churches , and become the existing state churches right to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship . &quot;
the establishment of an Islamic welfare association is also important to take care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
these rights are also obligations .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must unite and be willing to collabor@@ ate with the state in many areas and given certain control options to him . &quot;
&quot; to this end , also the read@@ iness to come up against religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Mos@@ lems , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , commented on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts may also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted such conflict in Germany would immediately &quot; have their right to stay here in Germany , in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
&quot; integration will continue to be a lot more than today , a topic for all society today . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society must change , the removal of discrimination and rac@@ ism is urgent . &quot;
Germany indeed - as a result of European decisions - since a decade of a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and an employment law .
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , like the NSU @-@ series , pointing down the rac@@ ist motive systematically in the police and authorities . &quot;
the same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organizations and advoc@@ acy groups of non @-@ white male has under@@ min@@ ed for a long time and what international agreements have to be true for the next years when the country will remain peace@@ fully and their new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of providing healthcare to the so anticipated refugees , President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery said . &quot;
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and Capacities , we create this , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money would be to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery calls back to all the com@@ bu@@ id@@ ents immediately in the registration of health tickets . &quot;
&quot; thus , performances can be accounted for by the federal states . &quot;
&quot; and in the long @-@ term , it is highly question@@ able to remove so many people with the limited care catalogue committed to the asylum seek@@ ers law . &quot;
otherwise the doctors do especially make the language barriers .
&quot; thus far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proved to be worse than other patients , reported by the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , nor in medical practices , interpre@@ ting services should be taken over , they call for them . &quot;
helped many refugees as well as more common medical applications in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic ga@@ ze .
&quot; in some refugee children , there are much more untreated disabilities , and in the young people they go with HIV du@@ ci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; with some other hand imag@@ ery , German doctors came from their education but clearly , Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; the paras@@ ite case or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize , &quot; and as for the doctor of doctors , the refugees may occur in sight with the refugees . &quot;
Syrians have a highly developed education system ; some refugees are even physicians .
&quot; to practice this , however , they would have to prove their qualification and if one would add more ex@@ ams again . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psychological causes ( B@@ Pt@@ 100 ) psych@@ ologically ill : most of them suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress measuring or even depression .
&quot; Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ ol@@ k , are especially vulnerable . &quot;
a recently published study of TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee date is trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
&quot; who is ill in a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress failure , suffers from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleeping and concentration problems , strong dis@@ ru@@ ptions and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , an early treatment is necessary , &quot; Mun@@ z stated . &quot;
&quot; so far , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees get a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; while psych@@ ically ill , asylum seek@@ ers can submit an application for psych@@ otherapy , but the processing takes part usually several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , non@@ fiction workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to false ass@@ essments , says Mun@@ z . &quot;

&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current production stage .
&quot; for more than 33 years , the Cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
so the gift to the delight of the family is in the blood .
&quot; it is important to take away people from her everyday life and take them away in a completely different world for two hours , emphas@@ izes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;

&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ izes Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
mis@@ use in the attitude of circ@@ uses are only very often subject to different animal protection organisations .
&quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also particip@@ ates in this position : &quot; &quot; if our animals are not doing well , we are not doing well . &quot;

&quot; Zimbabwe , Robert Mug@@ abe holds wrong speech in parliament . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , Mr Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , climbed down the stairs from a podium . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the Falls arose quickly across the social media . &quot;
&quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by the claims of members of the Opposition , that they would have threatened anonymous death threats and warned them from a warning to Mr Mug@@ abe . &quot;
&quot; last month they had hat@@ ched him and interrupted him , during his speech on the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition leaders received SMS messages on their mobile phones which they previously warned against Mr. Mug@@ ab@@ es .
&quot; the message comes from a number that will not appear , but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists after Mug@@ ab@@ it . &quot;
&quot; the party members warns that the immun@@ ity ends in parliament , and as soon as they leave parliament , is no longer effective . &quot;
the executive spokes@@ man said that Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; worried &quot; by the dangers for the politicians .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard gets up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to increase 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of the company &apos;s restructuring and savings efforts . &quot;
&quot; today , HP will share two listed companies into two listed companies and split the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and business operations . &quot;
&quot; the expected vac@@ ancy breakdown leads to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer that should guide the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is smaller and more focused on HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ening portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ yearly revenues and is expected to deliver an integrated technology solutions for companies so far - an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard who has been called electrical equipment and their Palo Alto Garage you called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive re@@ structure to handle the turn from traditional computers to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer , and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on belief that strongly focused companies can achieve a better performance . &quot;
FC al captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates will have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ ey that it wasn &apos;t until September and that when his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimi@@ stic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four matches for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate Kn@@ uck@@ le injury and then back to its old moment@@ um during the pre@@ season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury does not threatened the career , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that healed not well .
that is no greater matter .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in association with Kn@@ uck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously . &quot;
&quot; from purely medical point of view this may be true , but as a few recognized , there is the corresponding danger of further injuries , whenever one player tries to return to the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an un@@ comfortable pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd recorded 23 different illnesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
&quot; in just 65 out of Arsen@@ als , he played the last five times in the last five times . &quot;
the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight hours since 2007 / 08 that have been one of the two Premier League clubs .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but Arsenal thinks that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability remains during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have an accid@@ ental period of time you need to strengthen your body and fight strength , &quot; &quot; said L@@ ess . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome them .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he is going through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
Arsenal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ u@@ Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and to Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday evening and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ hat Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta must be started . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to allow a small break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; even though Arsenal are clear favor@@ ites , converted to group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir @-@ Stadium in Zagreb is one of the worldwide in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effects in Europe . &quot;
&quot; even after 41 games , Dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched during the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , being measured on the Richter scale . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal moved the apprentices@@ hip from the last season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco , left with the far hope of leading the club to his first European voc@@ ative triumph . &quot;
&quot; this impulse is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked in Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open themselves , now desper@@ ate than ever before , as su@@ prise outdoors among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ Ho@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in males aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains common in men than for women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , Camp@@ aign Against The Living One Camp@@ aign ( CA@@ LM ) announced that Camp@@ aign Against a erb@@ ated Life ) 2015 than the year of a man with the aim of asking the culture in question when seeking to help them if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent survey of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ press@@ ant symptoms demonstrated that if the suffering has a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; its chances of being doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritu@@ ally healthy friends reduce the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course one has to have friends yet so that friendship can operate .
&quot; in the age of more than social media , communication with its focus on the style over substance is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to be strong , fun and successfully to appear , even if in reality the isolation is domin@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; this superf@@ icial success is dominated by the dominant what psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values . money , image , social status , everything on cost in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner long@@ ings for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game inventor , billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy luck . &quot;
the beauty of friends was that this focus was raised on the head .
&quot; every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ined through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler h@@ ugs , Mom@@ ents at football gu@@ arding in cozy arm@@ chairs and nostal@@ gia of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men are looking forward to each case even if they often rest@@ rain themselves , complete their feelings . &quot;
&quot; like a staff of telephone calls it told me , &quot; ... &quot; my listening role for people who are de@@ pressed and self @-@ je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed , showed me really clearly , as even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends could make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; the ancient phr@@ asing &quot; I come along with it &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you speak of problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I try to offer long @-@ lasting worry mechanisms .
it clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; much my objective out@@ si@@ ze@@ al status via telephone the people in moments of desp@@ air can also help , long @-@ term support comes from a personal networking of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship festival with which to commemor@@ ate the celebration of the day , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you &apos;re in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone sitting around alone , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
one never know which the difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets Mary to help PS@@ G to grin@@ d Malmö
angel Di Maria is celebrating at Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Edinburgh son Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malmö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass over .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
&quot; Angel Di Maria and Edinburgh son Cav@@ ani held course , when Paris Saint @-@ Germain commenced his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G players who brought the French champion to the way , but afterwards , they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their advantage , when Cav@@ ani achieved a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and S@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A takes Paris a strong start against the Swedish master , because they do not only stri@@ ve the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ final in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they were given the points , it was not a class iel from Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ s Team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ics missed chance before the gate . he was later moved in action against his home town team and against the club with which he started his har@@ rowing career back in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to gr@@ asp our opponents , even if there are certain things we need to perfect in the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret it , that we didn &apos;t even have one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; based on his injury in one of three changes to the Paris @-@ Team , Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris @-@ Team to hold a 2 : 2 tie at its own place against Bordeaux in the First League but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ mer was described as the man who was able to take the PS@@ G into the next stage in Europe when he was heading to Manchester United States in the last month , and he said in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is pass behind the Malmö defence , before he closed to Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Cel@@ tic described in a play @-@ off in order to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was excited with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed away from Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ e in the 3@@ 4th minute , they b@@ oured little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself gave himself up sometimes , with some mal@@ lows and bad abst@@ ain , not least from Mic@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who , at no less than five attempts , died in the first half only after re@@ boot after re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill , when he had brought his players to the game , and it was a Pass of Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic and transformed the Di Maria into a shooting , which was given by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd Minute of the P@@ fo@@ e ... &quot;
&quot; finally , the second gate came shortly after the hour brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus accounted for its sixth straight line after Mic@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had f@@ ished a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; all thought on that Malmö in the game could come back , and just an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , was able to keep the final result low before a substitute E@@ ze@@ qu@@ ill Lav@@ e@@ zzi became an end at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later joined that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League play was last December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then we have played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification matches are not enough . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on plays great diversity in film@@ making
&quot; Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ American filmmaker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said , they will not be needed behind the scenes . &quot;
&quot; as a result of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown was used as this was the need for alternative perspectives and in relation to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen screen@@ play project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then you do with the instr@@ umentation of the film and not at the instr@@ umentation of the Show , &quot; Dam@@ ned Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; Brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with bel@@ ated un@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay , &quot; when commenting on the comments of the actors from The Mar@@ tian . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the production numbers Ben @-@ Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers , to discuss the show fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I would like to admit people to think about it - whoever will always be the director , as it is the figure of the Harmony , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and it is a nut@@ shell , which is beaten by its white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People , nominated for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ ac@@ cio for directing the film &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on replied &quot; &quot; that her directing &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded on dis@@ appro@@ ve of women &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pushed his anger on the clip by writing &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can tell her diversity - that &apos;s so painful . &quot;
&quot; the we@@ et has served over 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 pieces since its release . &quot;
&quot; women &apos;s comments are coming at a time , on the exact r@@ att@@ ing representation in the media at the head of social discussions . &quot;
&quot; when teen@@ ager Michael Brown was put to death by a white polic@@ emen , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement , Switzerland &apos;s Movement and Public Prosec@@ ution in 2014 achieved a discri@@ min@@ ating practices against d@@ ashes . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards . &quot;
&quot; records rest , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their importance . &quot;

&apos; American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sports clim@@ bs and help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athl@@ ete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which completed the 7th season , had never experienced a competition participants that was able to complete all levels of his obst@@ acle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman turned off British to the finals . &quot;
for the last task you had to rock climbing on a 75 foot climbing we@@ dge in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within time , with which he was the first athl@@ ete who finished the demanding phase 4 by American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge just three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! News after the hard fought game , still under the shock over the winning of the Grand Prix of 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned a lot more than $ 10,000 or for a lifetime , &quot; &quot; Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap . &quot;
so quite suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood reporter to discuss the finals and why British , although he finished first at all , won &apos;t earn any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money is the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful prize , and life changed , he receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he swe@@ eps over it about it .
he just did so happy to have done what he did .
mass of awards earned him to fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he &apos;s a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac felt exactly the same if they had missed the roles .
America Ninja Warrior has been extended to a quad@@ ron season that will start fil@@ ming in the spring of 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ ne@@ on Minnesota &apos;s T@@ wins
MIN@@ I W@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once again they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the final place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
the T@@ wins spent a chance to climb the rise of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit if even only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to deal with over a big part of the season &apos;s second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tiger Manager Brad dem@@ us . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive backing , when Detroit offered three times in the first two lines , once in the sixth and then once in ninth place . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) put 6 times in the 1 / 3 routes and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw at the Bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to concentrate entirely into the game . &quot;
&quot; the newly designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game from Mart@@ ine@@ z , ever since he had four hits against Seattle on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he sha@@ ved the wo@@ w wood , &quot; said Aus@@ sie . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( impact training ) , looked at clearly better from the Bull@@ pen and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns towards the end of the seventh position , T@@ wins again had their best chance to get into the game . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks got a colorful , and Simon finished his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cian to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the hand@@ le@@ holder of the Bla@@ de Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy went over to the wall , the only man who was confron@@ ted with whom he was confron@@ ted with the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie @-@ striking Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; with a couple of buyers and the end @-@ Run in the second run , Ver@@ hagen made the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a double Play . &quot;
&quot; it was the major 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe had a double play &quot;
&quot; after Detroit added a buy @-@ Run at the end of the ninth interior , I introduced a R@@ BI @-@ double against the loose of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the rectangle stand S@@ ano , however , with three pit@@ ches for the fifth Save . &quot;
&quot; for the start of the game , Detroit benef@@ ited from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hughes . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two parts against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been kn@@ itted before the game from the vulner@@ ability after having fired more than a month because of back pain . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for myself , &quot; said Hughes , &quot; but I felt crowded as I felt and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after having received the Le@@ ad@@ off batt@@ ter , there was Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler from the single to second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z succeeded his 0 @-@ 21 Achie@@ vement series with the winners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers came in the second , with a one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; &quot; T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ itor said . &quot;
he did not hit especially well but he wi@@ ped the right spot .
&quot; Hughes had been in a pitch @-@ Count on the pitch , and scored no points in the third inning as it was replaced by the rec@@ ie@@ ver right @-@ handed A@@ J.@@ A@@ viewer . &quot;
at Hughes there were three hits with four hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ out outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ bal Sanchez was eliminated because of a violation of the wor@@ f@@ school .
&quot; he was studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; Sán@@ chez , since mid @-@ August on the level of injuries due to one shoulder @-@ key , is scheduled to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with the same name , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is deleted from the lack of injuries to start the T@@ wins . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30 &quot;
he has been found guilty of dist@@ ortion in the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end its series of three games at the Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play in Minnesota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) . &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be defeated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected on Wednesday night .
&quot; people should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the town of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it was calculated with 450 to 750 job refugees .
several sports halls of the h@@ ess@@ ian capital were prepared for this case in recent days .
&quot; up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily defeated . &quot;
they will then be distributed to other municipalities .

Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria
&quot; head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with a German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that no evidence of military action options must not be held without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he designed the European States as &quot; collective path . &quot;
four years ago it was glad that the Chal@@ ice had passed a military participation in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict lands in the front of our door , &quot; he said in radio Deutschland@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington urged also a massive rise of international aid to refugees .
Austria controlled in southern and eastern boundaries
&quot; after Germany again Austria , Austria has re@@ introduced controls to his southern and eastern limits . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner announced the Austrian TV station on Tuesday night , but nobody returns to Hungary on Tuesday evening . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , no refugees have returned to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , it has been agreed that , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement , after Germany could capture a certain number of refugees from Austria every day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , said it had already given discussions between the general director of Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
specific numbers did not refer and refer to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees came across the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
your goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann apply for a special summit in cooperation with several other EU leaders in the next week .
Germany began on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; so far , the EU states have not yet to agree on a joint action in crisis . &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new call for the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on upcoming Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; in view of the strong refugee movement in Germany , the federal government plans to support the country &apos;s first @-@ rise and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; in cooperation with the countries of the Federal Chanc@@ ell@@ ery , the Federal Government will have held this agreement with the Minister @-@ President in Berlin on the late Tuesday evening . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lining those people , who would need protection , yiel@@ ded this also . &quot;
but who doesn &apos;t have a lead @-@ retro@@ spective could not stay in Germany either .
this view was dealt with op@@ pres@@ sive in the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole has to handle a &quot; huge force exhau@@ sts . &quot;
thousands desper@@ ate refugees are stuck in the Balkans .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia in the night of Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced that the border was back to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; in order to prevent the tugs of expul@@ sion over Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said to the planned new border . &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
&quot; there were first ar@@ rests of people , who had cross the fence . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of migrants lost their way to the Greek border in Turkey . &quot;
spac@@ ecraft de &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i &quot; finds the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
the Satur@@ n@@ monds en@@ cel@@ ad@@ us s@@ app@@ ended a global ocean under the maintenance of Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the moon is easily accessible to ring the ring . &quot;
&quot; although this sort of sigh@@ tings is only small , but it is too great for a continuous wave of Heaven , it is said in a message by the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the field of &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
the last longer was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cap of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; so , in 2006 , Cas@@ sin@@ i had discovered ic@@ ans from Saturn in the South Pole of San Satur@@ n@@ monds to feed water vap@@ or and ice @-@ particles , so that they feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , closed the astronom@@ ers then . &quot;
the extent of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .

Rama had already compl@@ ained about pain in the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to the Munich lions , the diagnosis is meant to break up four weeks of forced ch@@ break . &quot;
&quot; this is true for us , Rama is a terrible loss . &quot;

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and mo@@ ist @-@ sweet .
&quot; but whoever wants to pay attention to its sl@@ ender line , is often di@@ stra@@ yed from them . &quot;
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially suc@@ rose .
&quot; the exotic fruits still are good : in them , B vitamins and the vitamins E and C. above all contain man@@ g@@ os , but with the pre@@ amplifier beta @-@ car@@ otene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruits , thus supports ey@@ eing , immune system , and met@@ abolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ os should not be too soft , or to be firm , and smell pleasing . &quot;
&quot; the shell color alone says nothing about it , like the fruit is - so also green man@@ gan@@ os can taste delicious . &quot;
&quot; if stored at room temperature , they should be consumed within less days . &quot;
&quot; then they taste of course , pure or in tasty dishes . &quot;
&quot; a man@@ go is also a sav@@ our@@ y dish , a special touch . &quot;

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square
&quot; just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of the City of Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino , a previously un@@ riv@@ alled place in the park has been baptized by the Opp@@ io @-@ Hills on Wednesday . &quot;
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; .
&quot; the park is located in the heart of Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um . &quot;
the nam@@ ing was applied to the evangel@@ ical community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , the priest of the Protestant Lutheran congregation in Rome , rec@@ alled that protest@@ ants could only live for centuries as a minority in the city of the Pop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; with the course of this , the space becomes symbolic that its tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young of August to visit Rome for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he was feeling the city back then .
his negative impressions should be encouraged to see him in his later battle against Rome .
&quot; Luther , then , had led the split in the domestic church with his thes@@ es . &quot;
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works depicting the Ot@@ mar Old for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updating Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that now appeared with outstanding pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who form@@ ulates his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of Bi@@ blical stories on paper and screen . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means in@@ significant with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the respective topics can be adapted to a quite dark . &quot;
&quot; for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he made a sub@@ jective gl@@ ass@@ ort@@ ment from the many them@@ ed departments of the book book of all books . &quot;
&quot; cycles have emerged who dev@@ ote topics such as cross times , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fathers . &quot;
&quot; he equally fascin@@ ated several partners , saying : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological alignment as well as the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its main focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and this is , especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who set itself on the basis of painting with the respective Bible sections . &quot;
he interpreted the Bible verses by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current dialogue .
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original text of Martin Luther and the author , both of the artist , who form@@ ulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry store has golden L@@ aps .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to a deep insight into his soul &apos;s emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
&quot; ultimately became apparent in@@ sol@@ vent for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that heard the strict rules of Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; then the education came up with the pi@@ pe@@ as , &quot; remembers Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to raise the up , maybe even to bear me with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
&quot; his second aim was to help art in fast pac@@ ed time again : &quot; the perception of image worlds is min@@ ted today by advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
Sym@@ bo@@ lik is being pushed .
artists have a different lust and delight to show things .
pictures are always mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt let us assume that the viewer can fall into the pictures , they will discover , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the picture will look for his oppos@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost began on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art was &quot; I like he understands with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , I don &apos;t look forward to compreh@@ end the Bible completely , but those who are important for him , too . &quot;
&quot; it was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the lyrics simply explains . &quot; it was a picture of the images . &quot;
&quot; for Hans W@@ ant@@ enn@@ as of Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en its life and to freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert pictures speak for kit@@ es both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility as well .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and cloth images - presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15 at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation . &quot;
construction work for BM@@ X rail
&quot; made up , the company was commissioned to model@@ ed the earth hills for a circuit : one year later , almost anything was completed - yet before the official inauguration of the BM@@ X track was finally finished . &quot;
&quot; par@@ agra@@ phs in politics and administration provided for tre@@ ason , especially among the occup@@ ants who would not toler@@ ate the rail@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; i.e. , hill deported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the permission will take place in October , Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock was now able to communicate Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock during the Child and Youth Committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year has still happened to be seen , &quot; she said . &quot;
it should be started without a &quot; break @-@ break &quot; with works at the former indoor pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees from refugees from 2019 , in the Bundesliga as a clear mark on the weekend . &quot;
the football is respon@@ ding to the excellent position in Germany and sec@@ ures his help in seeking the problems of increasing problems .
&quot; I hold this for the greatest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there is no one to say in principle , this is nothing but I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; that must be interested in everyone to get this subject in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B , Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel , on 23 September in Berlin , he inten@@ sively wanted to discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I am next Wednesday at the Chanc@@ ell@@ ery and meet there the State Minister , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic that will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could help and wool .
but the decisive turn@@ key has to place politics .
&quot; therefore , the German football association has thus expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years . &quot;
&quot; on the outskirts of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta , the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation has ensured that this programme has been running until 2019 . &quot;
also some federal gi@@ sts support this programme .
&quot; on this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ des have been setting a clear signal when it will carry on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ ship logos ( Hermes ) - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make sure that everyone can help , where and how they can only do , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ head Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler , who said &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ comprehen@@ sion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama returns everyone , nobody &apos;s impossible to see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football teams , no , we have to use our cast@@ ings , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees that have been so incredibly suffering , &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent signs of the league . &quot;
&quot; for the Euro 2016 quali@@ fier on Hungary on Friday , the national team of women invite 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
&quot; all 36 Lic@@ ens@@ or have started their own projects in their own projects , is great . &quot;
&quot; just as great , small and smallest clubs are there . &quot;
&quot; 1 : 0 for an welcome , which we spent , is living in football . &quot;
&quot; it is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this and the next year , the association will jointly represent $ 300 for the integration of refugees , together with the DF@@ B selection and the German government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; reported K@@ id@@ s@@ bach . &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us towards Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us struck in the first group play of the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; the national player is also missing the table leader of the soccer league , in the du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately we cannot go back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ kel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B Coach is open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high strain of his professionals , Tu@@ kel will not only change his stem 11 position on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change to the door@@ ke@@ epers .
that &apos;s why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the seat of dedicated fr@@ art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; the football @-@ teacher praised the world champion . &quot;
&quot; if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in the future in all Europe @-@ League games , however , Tu@@ chel is open openly . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also dispute the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ bear witness of the player Re@@ us , that the final step for the B@@ V@@ B in Europe League had to be the goal , holding mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ n for comprehen@@ sible : &quot; that &apos;s why Marco does not lie so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
robot cars : government wants to push forward role for Germany
Germany shall be according to the will of the Federal Government &apos;s Trans@@ ition on the Trans@@ ition of Technology .
the Federal kab@@ in@@ ett adopted a strategy paper issued on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) which provides investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse Show of a &quot; new mobile Age . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less stress , Do@@ brin@@ dt said . &quot;
he also wants to discuss the topic with his counter@@ part from the G7 countries that come together with representatives of industry .
the transport paper of the Federal Ministry also emphas@@ ises the importance of the mobile broadband expansion and an individual course on digital radio communications .
&quot; for testing new technology , there is currently a test ride on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the driver &quot; no additional liability issues , &quot; the German government wants to check the legal framework conditions , and wherever necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; so , Germany wants to be able to deplo@@ y approximately internationally , that the permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will be increased from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also aims to deplo@@ y for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has previously seen only the driver as a driver . &quot;
&quot; when automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver will become more and more of the passenger . &quot;
technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that process the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; following a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , mobile vehicles are expected to continue in public roads &quot; until 2020 . &quot;
the value added value in the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany location estimates the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the trucks can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD Parliamentary Council S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; the question of liability in accidents and safety of the driver &apos;s personal data , however , must be clearly explained . &quot;
still the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French@@ men or Americans .
&quot; a survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA assessment of the For@@ sa Institute , on behalf of the investig@@ ator DE@@ K@@ RA , comes to the result that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be able to prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent did not believe in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 per cent of respondents say with autonomous driving by 2025 , in the US 33 percent . &quot;
anyway driving drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; following a survey by the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent agree to provide control during the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; at the speed@@ way , there could be no fewer than 15 percent in continuous traffic , at St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
a good one would leave the car under no circumstances .

&quot; at that time , Timo also saw him , and we have become European champion . &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of a completely big fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : window man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which look for human@@ kind thanks to video projec@@ tions . &quot;
the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer who was among others Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene was - and that he stuck men into skirts .
I cannot say today that I am the en@@ f@@ ant dress of the Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have a white hair .
&quot; previously it was ble@@ ak , it is genuine , &quot; Gaul@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From pav@@ ement to the cat@@ walk ) , that is visible from September 18th to the Kuns@@ thalle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his own attitude towards a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; he actually had been against it , because , &quot; for me it sounded a little bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you get into the museum . &quot;
&quot; the impressive collection had previously made , previously in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris station . &quot;
&quot; a lot more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the Director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into that very inst@@ ig@@ ning work of man , which has written fashion history , has ever completed an apprentices@@ hip . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically the look is not built , but it is an excellent , chore@@ ograph@@ ed plastic works designed for which much effort was used : for example , a styl@@ ist has been engaged for example . &quot;
&quot; according to details of the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have ar@@ red about 14 tonnes of material . &quot;
&quot; just before the start of the October Festival was a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l , a le@@ ather@@ band out@@ fit with Kor@@ s@@ ett . &quot;
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; Women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
even Gaul@@ ti@@ ers &apos; old Teddy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , do@@ ck@@ ly modified Geh@@ versuche of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he put on his Teddy B@@ HS and dresses , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; with a doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
the dra@@ fting of fashion he subsequently produced himself .
&quot; he st@@ ole fashion magazines , and saw the designs of other designers at the Gaul@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
&quot; later I bought it , but then bought it . &quot;
for his first fashion show he cannot pay the models .
they got nothing but was allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ den@@ d@@ ina - Pl@@ ate tip as fashion @-@ niche
&quot; previously , it went to the long nitrogen @-@ machines in and around Pl@@ auen , about one meter . &quot;
&quot; the best included substances and tips were produced in large quantity for customers , such as ceilings and gar@@ d@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; today , the alone does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains , managing director of the screw slots . &quot;
instead the fashion is important again .
&quot; in the schedule of the Pl@@ a@@ wning top , fashion played a bigger role , was pushed through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt explains some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and at regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; the so @-@ called Vintage mode , which leans against past stit@@ ches , is an increasing client potential . &quot;
&quot; who serves no niche in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer available on the market . &quot;
they are already making up half of all the contracts with us .
screw @-@ wearing Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association of Pl@@ a@@ wning lace and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they may carry the protected label .
in the last 15 years about 80 percent of sales are broken off .
there are almost no longer private stores and wholesale stores .
our products hardly can reach our customers on this path .
&quot; nowadays , the mass goods will be much cheaper in the Asian region and distributed almost exclusively on chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , export to Russia and the United States is weaker . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new trails .
the industry association also tries to score through environmental awareness such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer developed by Em@@ broi@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; this year we have a quality seal that demonstrates that we produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally .
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the used materials . &quot;
diplom@@ at Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger accounts of the West@@ - Sax@@ on University Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
&quot; to oppos@@ e the competition from the Asian region , one must find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that takes time and courage .
&quot; an area of conflict between the ligh@@ test ideas of the designers and the enterprises , who must think of all economically , says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design often varies greatly to keep a client base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ alizes the historic petrol station . &quot;
the machine st@@ ains small kitchen on some places .
the pl@@ ain@@ ted Gold@@ smith &apos;s colleague Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took away : &quot; before that I couldn &apos;t start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ts tip . &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ pointed tip for their jewelry .
&quot; in an elabor@@ ate process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identi@@ fies the topic of Pl@@ au@@ zer head - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies us in the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially at customers whose ancestors stayed in Pl@@ auen and surroundings , and want to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
that is how I see my jewelry as modern amb@@ ass@@ adors of Pl@@ au@@ zer leaders .
Disney planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film

&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; it &apos;s not about a novel film , but in order to be a sort of sequ@@ el that plays for 20 years after the first film with the magic children &apos;s mouth . &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world &apos;s economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .

XI is pushing up the world &apos;s economy wide to open the world
&quot; the economy has to open wide out@@ wards , to promote growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday to a group , which was t@@ asked with steering the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should apply for it to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business decisions , &quot; &quot; said in an address given at the 16th session of the Central Executive Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
start @-@ ups and reforms promote reforms will present new moment@@ um and vitality and offer new space for economic growth - X@@ i said .
&quot; the guide group has adopted a number of direc@@ tives , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of the border controls , investment of governmental organisations ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the residents @-@ mess@@ aging system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is created to identify the sectors and businesses that do not come into question . &quot;
testing is tested and tested by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance , since the market is providing a greater role in allocation of resources , ensuring a legally established business environment and is an open plan on the market . &quot;
the government will also fail to lo@@ osen up controls over the companies that are transferred to companies such as their businesses .
the statement also stated that China border regions will allow new models of cross @-@ border economic co@@ operations and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas will be opened for private investment . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policies towards foreign investment and will protect the right interests of foreign financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners , to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by order to maintain the requirements and application process . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities , to use their work and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Liu Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting as reported in a declaration issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; the European Commission aims to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish , thus ensuring a significantly higher dose of professional gifts . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch , the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , also critic@@ ised the plans of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans and adverse events of mis@@ sive industrial and environmental policy , with full impact of pregnant women and infants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of a nervous system should be raised for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ - or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish , however , is already heavily bur@@ dened by mercury that on the basis of the current limit values approximately 50 per cent of the length must not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ compatible . &quot;
&quot; in exchange for this Lock@@ heed , the EU according to F@@ ood@@ watch is aiming to boost the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 mg to 0,1 milli@@ gram of mercury per kilogram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch , however , described it as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ ri@@ fish , such as car@@ p usually cul@@ minated so low that they already keep the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of the g@@ einf@@ o is &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of the di@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
&quot; mercury is highly toxic to humans , mainly through the food chain particularly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes . &quot;
the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; even small amounts may cause long @-@ born cran@@ i@@ als of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry announced its homepage , with regard to the current maximum values , but that there is not a &quot; health threat to the general population . &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of Environment , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ gen ordered more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume issued in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish for instance in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube may be &quot; permanently and widespread , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; was quoted from the paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , European war@@ nings from mercury in fish had already been related to the most common health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF . &quot;
F@@ ood@@ watch calls consumers to protest to protest against the plans of the EU on : www.@@ qu@@ mercury @-@ shareholders . food@@ stuff
