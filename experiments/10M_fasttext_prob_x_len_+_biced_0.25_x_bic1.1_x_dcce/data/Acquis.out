II ) that the candle material during the duration of non @-@ employment of the backup measures will not be used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear bodies .
&quot; B ) The organization and the Community meet a regulation , that the backup measures intended in this Convention will not be used for as long as the core material used in such activity . &quot;
&quot; as far as possible , these backup measures will be defined as long as possible and under which circumstances these backup measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the backup measures will once again be applied once the core material will resume a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization will be held over the total amount and the composition of this material in the respective state , or for any transfer of such material from that state or these countries . &quot;
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it only extends to matters such as inter alia , time @-@ time and dis@@ agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or an under secrecy of military activity , and does not refer to the use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organisation , the community and the states bear the cost of increasing each of them in carrying out their respective obligations under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; develop the community , the states or persons who are subject to their territory , but extraordinary costs as a result of a special appearance of the organization , thus reimbur@@ sed the organisation that costs , provided that they did advance in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization carries the costs of all additional measurements and sampling possible by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the states ensure that the liability of responsibility for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used for the organisation and its officials for the purposes of implementing this Convention in the same manner as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim , which the community or a state towards the organization or the organization against the community or the organisation for damages - with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident - are asser@@ ted , resulting from the execution of the backup measures according to this Convention , is regulated in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; the Council asks for the examination of the information provided by the Director @-@ General , that no nuclear material , which has to be governed by the examination , for nuclear weapons or other nuclear bodies , so he can reimbur@@ se the reports specified in Article XII paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and if necessary , to take part in the other measures . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass has been achieved by the applied backup measures , and provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is concerned - any reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; in search of the organization , the Community or a State find consultations on issues that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to seek , therefore , that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention may be checked by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such issues by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of any disputes arising from the Council to Article 19 or any of the Council , disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not included in the negotiation process , or by another one by the organization , the community and the states to submit a party of arbitr@@ ators , which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states ren@@ ame two refer@@ ee , the organisation as well as two refer@@ ee , and the four as designated arbitr@@ ators chose a fifth , who presi@@ ding the presidency . &quot;
&quot; have the community and the states or the organization of binary days after the request for an arbitr@@ ator should not be named two arbitr@@ ators , so the community or organisation can seek the President of the International Court of Justice , to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure is applicable , if binary days after the designation or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator of the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected . &quot;
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Convention is in@@ capable , and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the arbitration should be binding for the organization , the community and the countries concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Agreement shall be concluded for non @-@ governmental organizations , the contracting party of the contract and the members of the Community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organisation have already stated that its procedures for the entry into force of this Convention are concluded and &quot;
&quot; II ) if the Community has the organisation , it is able to apply their backup measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
a ) The organization of the community and the states consult each other at the request of any of the contract parties on a change in the Convention .
&quot; B ) All changes are subject to the consent of the organization , the Community and the states . &quot;
C ) The Director @-@ General instruc@@ ts all Member States of the organisation as equal to any change in the convention .

B ) This Agreement shall remain in force such as long as the States Parties .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; means the agreement and the protocol together . &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to set the procedure to carry out the provisions of the part I via backup measures such as required .
the goal of the backup measures established in this Convention is the timely discovery of the ab@@ bi@@ ased amounts of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear bodies for un@@ familiar purposes as well as the de@@ terr@@ ent of such a breakdown by the risk of premature discovery .
&quot; for the creation of the published in Article 28 established goal , the material storage is fundamental as a backup of fundamental importance , inter@@ connec@@ t@@ edness with the spatial de@@ mar@@ cation and observation as an important supple@@ mental action . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the follow @-@ up surveys by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each type of material supply , which is specified for a specific period of time , under indication of the accuracy of the accuracy . &quot;
&quot; when carrying out their follow @-@ up inspections , the organization makes for article 3 full use of the safety system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on an outline in material bil@@ lets .
&quot; when using their backup measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following ways and it , as far as required , see how they are intended in complementary distances and pur@@ pose@@ ful : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preser@@ v@@ ative , her@@ edi@@ fied , lost , lost or in other way from the stock of remote material and inventory ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement certainty ;
&quot; C ) Proc@@ ed@@ ure for identification , testing and evaluation of differences in measurements of sender and receiver ; &quot;
e ) Proc@@ ed@@ ence for evaluating app@@ ell@@ ants not measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) A protocol - and reporting system , which indicates the material materi@@ alistic zone of the core material and the changes of this stocks , including the one - and outputs of the materials zone . &quot;
g ) precautions to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proc@@ ed@@ ures to the reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in line with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the backup measures after this Convention will not extend to material in the mining industry or with the arch@@ ing preparation .
&quot; B ) is ur@@ ped Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ber material which has not yet reached in the states , so shares the organization of the organization introduced the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves nuclear material , which is suitable for composition and purity for the fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ open@@ an@@ ium , in which it is produced , or is introduced this nuclear material or other , at a later stage of the nuclear energy cycle in the states , so it is subject to the others in this Convention @-@ called security measures . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) The backup measures specified in this Convention shall not be termin@@ ated for nuclear material under the requirements specified in Article 11 , but the community believes that the recovery of core material , the security measures according to this Convention is not possible or desired , so consult the organization and the community to each other about the application of suitable security measures . &quot;
B ) The backup measures specified in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under Article 13 . if the organization and the community notice that this core material is practically not reco@@ ver@@ able .
&quot; at the request of the community , the organisation releases the following core material from the security measures according to this Convention : &quot;
&quot; a ) exceptional material , if used in grams - or smaller amounts than sensor in instruments ; &quot;
&quot; B ) nuclear material , if used in non @-@ nuclear activities after Article 13 , if such core material is reco@@ ver@@ able , &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with a Is@@ ot@@ open@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 which is over 80 % .
&quot; looking for the community liber@@ ates the organisation of nuclear material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this Convention , provided by these backup measures , provided the whole , due to this article in the states of free core material , at no time is more than
a ) In total a kilo@@ gram of special p@@ added material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an appropri@@ ation of 0,@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above , is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the rich@@ ment , &quot;
III ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment which lies under 0.@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above nature is calculated by multip@@ lier of its weight with the fifth square of rich@@ ment ;
B ) total of ten m@@ etrical met@@ ric tons of natural uran and rounded ur@@ an@@ ium with an increase of more than 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
&quot; C ) twenty m@@ etric met@@ ric tons torn down by 0,@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) , or below ; &quot;
&quot; if your nuclear material is designed along with nuclear material , which is subject to the backup measures according to this Convention , processed or stored for the re @-@ application of the backup measures on the material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organization supple@@ mentary instructions , which is required in the scope that is required to successfully implement and effectively the tasks of the organization according to this Convention , in the individual how the procedures established in the Convention . &quot;
the supple@@ mental paragrap@@ hs can be extended or changed without amendment to this Convention in agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supple@@ mental ab@@ uses at the same time comes into force with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organisation , the community and the states are able to enter into force nine days after the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this period requires a delay of the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; the organisation set out on the basis of the initial reporting of the entire , the security measures of the entire , the backup measures of this Convention in the States , regardless of its origin , and carries out this inventory on account of the following reports and the results of their veri@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; in ER@@ WA@@ Y NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC decided to help to address the immediate need for international economic co @-@ operation , to help the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ age problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States , that the whole of the member states is bound to force within six months , and as far as possible within two years after entry into force of loans , and the organisation will do its best to achieve this goal . &quot;
( D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle classes in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographic distribution within the framework of this agreement .

the special account will be separately and separated from all other accounts and activ@@ ism of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or un@@ parall@@ eled notes of the Member State , which are to pay in the currency of the respective state to order of the organisation as the administrator of the Special Representative , and to deposit the organization in the country in question . &quot;
&quot; B ) Payment is made in two rates , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution of 30 days into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator at the agreed date ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second of the resi@@ dual amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or any other time , which agreed to be agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines necessary for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Every@@ one Member State can make payments before the above @-@ mentioned appointments .
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker , according to the usual procedures of the organization , takes about dis@@ proportionate pulling on cash or the deb@@ tors in order to cover the expenditure on the special @-@ term loan and the special @-@ term account in appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the guarantee of this loan , the car@@ et@@ akers can be guided according to the conditions of the EEC of the following factors : &quot;
to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
VI ( VI ) the composition and the trend of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit capacity to Dar@@ leh@@ ens@@ ity without delay ; and
VII ) the circum@@ ference in which the problems of the countries concerned are regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special @-@ term loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly out@@ able development programme ( including a sec@@ toral Committee ) , regardless of whether or not , according to the procedure and practices , which is governed by the formation of the organization financed by the Organisation ( including a letter b ) of pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement with the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;

&quot; apart from Section 4 Special Representative to the same return conditions , which are generally considered for the organization granted development loan in general , they are refundable at ten free @-@ years each in 50 years . &quot;
special @-@ term loan can be granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of these bones are immediate to the organization which they reserve .
&quot; each special @-@ term loan can be viewed by a separate Dar@@ leh@@ ens@@ ation agreement between the beneficiaries , and the ste@@ ward , in which , in particular the origin of the means is given . &quot;
&quot; the revenue from each special @-@ term loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the beneficiaries , or for goods or services that are manufactured b@@ z@@ w . ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization , and according to the measure of which the administrator at the time of the loan has been specified , recei@@ vers of a special action . &quot;
&quot; capital payments of special @-@ term payments are made to the special account , and the amount paid in the currency of an membership fee is returned to its receipt as soon as possible by the administrator at the relevant Member State . &quot;
&quot; the administrator is instruc@@ ted up to the complete allocation of all specialized articles , the EEC relating to the assessment by the directors in preparation and the submitted projects and programmes approved by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of withdrawal of the special @-@ term loan , the administrator has taught the EEC quarterly on the development of the special @-@ term loan and the expenditure for this . &quot;
&quot; the administrator submitted to the EEC as soon as possible after the conclusion of the transaction fiscal year , with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization on this account . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the Special Representative , the EEC will be transmitted as soon as possible a detailed report on the project financing and programmes . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker created and performs suitable records and billing , from which the contributions are available to the customer &apos;s account , which are paid out of the account and are deduc@@ ted from the account and the withdraw@@ als are visible to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the administrator work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator to complete issue of the Special Representative of Time to time gives an exchange of ideas about the state of the Special Representative , the continuation of the content of the Sonder@@ ac@@ tional Programme or plans and on all other issues that affect the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement came to an agreement on 31 December 1978 or at a later time that the EEC and the Organisation may come into effect , not into force , so the agreement and all of the resulting obligations of the parties are due to immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; however , the total amount of capital will be rep@@ lic@@ ated from the recei@@ vers in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and transferred to the Member States , so this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are ended with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; this agreement needs approval by the individual Member States and the EEC , according to the legal provisions of every party . &quot;
&quot; the governments of the Member States have a conclusion from the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of the European Communities , the conclusion which they are concerned . &quot;
&quot; together with a Noti@@ fication , this Noti@@ fications brings together with a Noti@@ fication of the regulatory approval of this agreement by the EEC . &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ o
&quot; I honour myself to take on the recent negotiations between our delegations to establish provisions on the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of common market organisation for sheep and goat meat by the community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are as follows : &quot;
&quot; fresh or cool@@ ed H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ ite - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina will set on the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in batt@@ le@@ body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a flaw@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure a suitable process that actually resulted in the agreed quantity not transc@@ ends and in accordance with conventional supply forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) . &quot;
&quot; if a change in the supply form should be possible , as a result of changes in technology and retail , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the number 10 stated below , in order to find adequate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protective clause in claim , it is obliged to carry out for it to worry about that that in this agreement , access to Argentina &apos;s Community market will not be touched . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the inser@@ ts from Argentina will exceed the agreed quantities in a year , the community reserves the right to exp@@ el the cover from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the added value of the products from this agreement to a high level set of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em is limited .
&quot; when entering new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina changes the number 2 fixed amount according to the scope of the Argent@@ in@@ ean trade with any new member state . &quot;
the import load@@ ings for these new Member States will be determined according to the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this is issued under the number 5 mentioned Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ ectomy of abor@@ tion .
&quot; the total number mentioned below is determined with the Day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community on 23 000 tons of battle body weight . &quot;
the community takes everything to avoid a market development which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ing on the Community market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the Community takes preced@@ ence , so that the paragraph of intervention stocks in frozen meat due to the implementation of the Regulation of Argent@@ in@@ ean H@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ bs did not under@@ mines . &quot;
&quot; considering the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of equipment or other conve@@ ying measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ ers and lam@@ bs are carried out only at prices and conditions that are consistent with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community at the world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 letter C ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ form and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , compliance with this agreement , in particular , guarantees that it has been issued in accordance with the quantities of export licenses for the products listed under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the community comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precautions , to make all necessary arrangements for the pre @-@ mentioned products which is made dependent in Argentina by the presentation of an export license , which is granted to the designated office by the Argent@@ in@@ ean government . &quot;
&quot; the details of the application of this system are set , so that on the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the authorised products can be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in implementation @-@ regulations , it is also specified that the local in@@ ean authority of the competent authority in the competent authority of the community in regular intervals have been granted , for export licenses ; these details may be de@@ code to destination . &quot;
the committee bears no concern that the agreement is properly applied and smoothly work .
&quot; he regularly checks the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market , as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including conditions which are of importance for that under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the committee bears no concern that the proper application of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat under the agreement will not be executed under the agreement of the Tari@@ ff numbers . &quot;
the committee also discussed all concerned with the implementation of this agreement and recommends the appropriate regulatory authorities .
the provisions of this agreement applies un@@ troubled for the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the amount used under number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 .
the amount of amount will be determined from the entry into force of this agreement up to the 1 January of the following year and shall take account of the seasonal character of trade .
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand the Treaty on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of every party to terminate them with a delay of one year in writing . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be checked by the two parties before the 1 . April 1984 with regard to changes that they should be understandable . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would share the consent of your government .
I honour me to confirm the receipt of your current writing with the following wording :
