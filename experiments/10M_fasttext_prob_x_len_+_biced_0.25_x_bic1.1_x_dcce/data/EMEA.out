this document is a summary of the European Public Relations Department ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which it is explained as the committee on human resources ( CH@@ MP ) carried out the studies conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package ( also component of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like further information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melt tab@@ letten , as a solution to one ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ es thinking and speakers , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or sight of things that are not present ) , mis@@ trust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ king @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder , in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high mood ) alternat@@ ely with periods of normal mood . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is used for the treatment of severe and severe severe episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients that have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is applied to rapid control of un@@ inhi@@ bit unrest or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces if the or@@ ale intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution to one or the melting hole in patients may be applied to which the lo@@ ops of tablets difficulties are prepared . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the dose of at@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells among each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ er@@ z@@ ole is probably acting primarily as &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters seems to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in with schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , whereby psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms decreases and their re @-@ occur is prevented . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , to prevent re @-@ occur in symptoms , was examined in three studies of up to one year . &quot;
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophren@@ ia or similar disorders that compared to a placebo period of two hours with a placebo .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was tested over 12 weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ oper@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo , have been stabili@@ zed in 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of at@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder caused by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients has been examined using a standard sc@@ ala disorder or the number of patients diagnosed in the treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body resor@@ bed the melting pot and the solution to the intru@@ sion .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution , A@@ bili@@ fy received in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms increased insecurity than patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in use for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder decreased at@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies more effective than placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition , A@@ bili@@ fy fet@@ ched up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the re @-@ occur military episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
ar@@ bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms increased anxiety and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for one ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ pyram@@ idal distur@@ ban@@ ces , dy@@ e ( pu@@ zz@@ ling ) , vom@@ iting ( contrac@@ ep@@ p@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , hel@@ pers , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy at the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe severe episodes with patients who had overwhel@@ m@@ ly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes spoke to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , opposite the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee also came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in rapid control of schizophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes with schizophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder , if a or@@ ical therapy is not suitable compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; June 2004 , the European Commission submitted to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy in the whole of the European Union . &quot;
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is responsible for the treatment of moderate @-@ severe episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had overwhel@@ m@@ ical episodes and their man@@ ic episodes have shown on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of the meals .
&quot; increased efficacy in doses on a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initi@@ al@@ dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duction is set off from the combination therapy , the arith@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the appearance of su@@ icide behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased addic@@ tive risk with Ari@@ pi@@ azz@@ z@@ ole has been compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic anti@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal coron@@ ary disease , in@@ toxic@@ ation , conditions imposed for hyp@@ ot@@ ony drugs , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure drugs ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ y form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; when with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of a sp@@ ig@@ dy@@ mis , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms , which indicate to a m@@ ns , or in@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be set . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with cr@@ amp@@ ant accidents in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or the states which are related to cr@@ amp@@ er in connection with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis patients treated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , an elevated mortality was treated compared to the placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted t@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em com@@ a or death , was reported in patients with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise evaluations of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related unwanted events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines treated to patients who allow direct comparisons .
&quot; Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie , and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; gaining weight gain is generally observed for schizophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , which is known for gaining weight as a side @-@ effect , or an unhealthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the remains of Ari@@ pi@@ azz@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is however not relevant to be clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving healthy pro@@ ban@@ ces increased a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) , the Au@@ c of Ari@@ pi@@ azz@@ z@@ ole to 107 % , whereas the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , similar effects have , and therefore similar dos@@ is@@ reductions should be made . &quot;
at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans can result the joint application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher Plas@@ ma@@ ast@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sible Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans .
&quot; considering the joint gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks to the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ ants , should have similar effects , and therefore similar dos@@ is@@ reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after placing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage should be lifted from AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to the dosage height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ape op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 will be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ er@@ ol@@ - concentrations . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the met@@ alli@@ ism of sub@@ str@@ ates from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phic an / 3 @-@ methodology ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zene ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phic ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or take a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data situation for safety in humans and due to the concerns carried out in the case of reproductive studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits are clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , also with other anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , the patients should be warned of hazardous machines , including power vehicles , to operate , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on it . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than by placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
schizophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks came with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ony and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ oper@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study on 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients , which were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ azz@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ zap@@ pers . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ er@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients under Hal@@ di@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long term recovery period over 26 weeks at a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo @-@ treated patients .
a comparison between the patients groups under Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ z@@ ole and placebo on which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters arose yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; under@@ scores of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ opho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of the patients treated with arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole patients compared to 2,@@ 0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the side @-@ effects caused by anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , the Mali@@ an neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and cr@@ amp@@ ant incidents among older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies and since the launch of the market launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional exagger@@ ations were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the effectiveness of a met@@ am@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ z@@ ole ; it is unlikely that ha@@ un@@ aly@@ sis has been used in the treatment of over@@ dose of benefits , as Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma @-@ operation . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder about the combination of a partial agon@@ izing effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors is conve@@ yed .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vit@@ ro a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recep@@ tor and the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tor , as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , to the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 ep@@ in@@ ep@@ tor and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; with the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses from 0,5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy pro@@ ban@@ ces showed the Pos@@ it@@ ar o@@ missions series a dose @-@ dependent on the bond of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the coup . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ azz@@ ben@@ zene in comparison to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in a Hal@@ run dol @-@ controlled study was conducted in Week 52 the share of Respon@@ ses patients , which were a response to study medication , in both groups a similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ in@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from Mess@@ ages , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depress@@ ants @-@ scale , showed a significant stronger improvement than at Hal@@ in@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizophren@@ ia , an significantly higher reduction of the withdrawal rate , which lay at 34 % in the Ari@@ as ben@@ zene group and 57 % among placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ der in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study involving schizophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study of &quot; weight gain &quot; was among significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca . &quot;
two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ z@@ ole a compared to placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ z@@ ole to placebo no superior effectiveness .
&quot; in two plac@@ ements and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , showed Ari@@ pi@@ azz@@ z@@ ole a compared to placebo over week 3 and a reduction effect , which was comparable to that of lithium or semi@@ oper@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also pointed out a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ ie as lithium or semi @-@ oper@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly reflects over 2 weeks not on Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic Ser@@ um , revealed the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ z@@ ole a superior effectiveness in reducing symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;

the average Eli@@ min@@ ation period is roughly 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole for exten@@ sible Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at nearly 14@@ 6 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; at Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ z@@ ole there are no differences between male and female healthy promot@@ ers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schizophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
&quot; a PDF @-@ specific analysis about Phar@@ m@@ imm@@ acul@@ ture yiel@@ ded no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin , or the effect of the smoking on the pharmaceuticals of Ari@@ pi@@ azz@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ azz@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study involving pro @-@ gangs with a common liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on impairment of liver function to the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics and de@@ hydr@@ o Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ z@@ ole , but the study comprised only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;

&quot; toxic@@ ological effects were observed only at doses or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited limited or no meaning for the clinical application . &quot;
the effects en@@ umer@@ ated a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ ym@@ ology loss ( o@@ c ) at the recommended maximum dose of diabetes ( o@@ c ) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ fold of the middle Ste@@ ady state exposure of 60 mg / kg / day ( o@@ c ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis has been established as a result of the discharge of sul@@ ph@@ ast@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle by monkeys after repeated economic dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg ( o@@ c ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;

AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied to rapid control by Agi@@ le and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces in patients with schizophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when a or@@ ical therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ er@@ ole injections should be ended and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
to boost the Res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability is an injection at the M. del@@ to@@ id or deep in the glut@@ eus @-@ Maxim@@ us muscle among sc@@ ram@@ bling regions recommended .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status considering the drug or acute treatment specified earlier ( see section 4.5 ) .

there are no investigations on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ er@@ ole injections in patients suffering from schizophren@@ ia and behavi@@ oral disorders that have been caused by schizophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ er@@ ole injection solution is considered to be necessary , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure case ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ er@@ ole injections are not available for patients with alcohol or pharmaceutical drugs ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal coron@@ ary disease , in@@ toxic@@ ation , conditions imposed for hyp@@ ot@@ ony drugs , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure drugs ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ y form ) . &quot;

&quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , alternat@@ ing consciousness and signs of autonomous instability ( irregular powder or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic , swe@@ ating and heart@@ beat disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie , and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; gaining weight gain is generally observed for schizophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic identi@@ ties , where weight gain is known as a side @-@ effect and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; however , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was higher compared to the overall gift of Ari@@ pi@@ azz@@ z@@ ole , in a study , in the healthy promot@@ ers of Ari@@ pi@@ azz@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was used as mono@@ gram in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ kul@@ aire . &quot;

&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe trau@@ ma , a similar efficacy has been observed with regard to the total population , but statistical signature could be found due to a decreased patient number . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ azz@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) compared to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ run dol @-@ controlled study was conducted in Week 52 the share of respon@@ dents patients , who have a response to study drug , in both groups a similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ in@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from Mess@@ ages , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery as@@ berg @-@ depress@@ ants , showed a significant stronger improvement than at Hal@@ in@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction of the withdrawal rate , which lay at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and with 57 % among placebo . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of my@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study , at the 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters had previously received an anth@@ rac@@ er . &quot;
the effect of my@@ x@@ ane ( in any gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug drug ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; in all , they spoke 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 with my@@ x@@ ane treated patients to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients , the conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine . &quot;
&quot; considering only the patients , which were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between medicines and survival for the deterioration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; however , with patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer with regard to these indicators , that my@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine . &quot;
&quot; it must also not be applied to patients , breastfeeding or before the start of treatment low ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ onic numbers in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the committee on human resources ( CH@@ MP ) proved that my@@ x@@ ane in patients , in which the first treatment was no longer suggests , more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines and that it has to be given in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines and other medicines to reduce unwanted effects . &quot;

&quot; compared to this , patients showed continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / d@@ l of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) like sudden , ste@@ eping migr@@ ations and con@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; exhau@@ st should not be applied in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this will be triggered by no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the committee on human resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for se@@ amed compliance with the provisions of the European Union , the drug has produced a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

&quot; symptoms of symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease @-@ last . hence , the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease may be required by the physician . &quot;
an increase in the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ s around more than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be avoided over a period of four weeks .

if the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ s worth more than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) increases or if the permanent hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ l / l ) exceeds 12 g / d@@ l ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be eng@@ low to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is in the lowest possible dose which is necessary for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ esthesia .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ B value ( &lt; 6 g / d@@ l or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher inflation than patients in which the initial an@@ emia is less heavily pronounced ( H@@ B &gt; 8 g / d@@ l or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

in clinical trials an increased mor@@ dial risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed if er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given by over 12 g / d@@ l ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have not shown any significant benefit which is attribut@@ able to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ der has been increased in control of the control of an@@ a@@ esthesia and avoiding blood trans@@ fusion .
the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ os rose approximately 1 g / d@@ l ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clinical coron@@ ary coron@@ ary heart failure or in@@ suffici@@ ency should be exceeded under Section 4.2 recommended upper limit of the hem@@ ost@@ asis in target con@@ centric .
&quot; after present present knowledge is accelerated by the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not di@@ aly@@ zed , the progression of kidney failure is not accelerated . &quot;
&quot; in tumor patients , chemotherapy should be taken into account for assessing the therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ answer ( patients that may be trans@@ acted ) . &quot;

the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etine should be based on an benefit risk fraud under the participation of each patient which should also consider the specific clinical context .

&quot; patients who undergo a larger electro orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure , as they obtain adequate thro@@ mbo@@ genic pro@@ phyla@@ xis , since it is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ lic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially with an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treating with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa suitable for patients with a starting point . &gt; 13 g / d@@ l can consist of increased risk of post@@ operative thro@@ mbo@@ lic / vas@@ cular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ xy does not have been proven for epo@@ xy that they improve overall survival with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tum@@ ours . &quot;

&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied along with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in controls and the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ind@@ osis should be adjusted to the rising hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ it . &quot;
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies there are no evidence of a interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F with regard to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .

the most common side @-@ effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ genic events ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .

&quot; survival and tumor were examined in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind , tu@@ re@@ controlled studies and &quot;
in the open study there was no difference in the overall survival between the patients with re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and the patient @-@ patient .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ous Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients with a an@@ a@@ emia due to several more frequent mal@@ ign@@ om@@ ous , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality than with controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications associated with re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and with checks .
&quot; there is an increased risk for thro@@ mbo@@ genic events in tumor patients , which can be treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ous Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ous Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tum@@ our patients , which are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a tick @-@ globe under 13 g / d@@ l , because too few patients with these characteristics were included in the transmitted data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ time of about 4 hours in healthy pro@@ ban@@ ces and a slightly prolonged half @-@ time of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; according to sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um mirror of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um mirror , which can be achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ tal risk ( bone breaks ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a dimin@@ trau@@ matic boun@@ cing back like that suffered from the bone ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip correction should be obtained before the first in@@ fusion , a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or inj@@ ecting into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; administration of acet@@ am@@ in@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headaches . &quot;
&quot; to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may only be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , almost 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of vert@@ ebr@@ ates were examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study involved 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis had suffered over 50 years , which recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the salary of alkal@@ ine ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or by at least 75 % compared to the output .
in the study with older women the risk of vert@@ ebr@@ ates was reduced by patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medi@@ cam@@ ents ) over a period of three years compared to the patients by placebo around 70 % .
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medi@@ cam@@ ents ) , with those among placebo the risk of hip implants was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with hip correction 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a have a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against customs , or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other components . &quot;
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ins are subject to patients with as@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to the risk of kidney , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws . &quot;

&quot; in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hips , the administration of in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended for two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip correction ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should be prescribed A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long drive @-@ emission period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent , low @-@ trau@@ matic stro@@ us@@ hes , the initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by the Gift of acet@@ am@@ in@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
patients with kidney disorder ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended as a limited clinical experience for these patients .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and Eli@@ min@@ ation in older patients is similar to the younger . &quot;
&quot; children and young people A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years of age , since data on in@@ conceivable and effectiveness are missing . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because this patient population is only limited clinical experience .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ a@@ emia is used before the start of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the quick setup of the effect of Zol@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary hypo@@ cris@@ y can develop in the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be used before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental treatment with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental implants , no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the max@@ il@@ ar area . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the prescri@@ bing doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by the Gift of acet@@ am@@ in@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of as serious side @-@ effect caused cases of pre @-@ hoping was increased in patients , the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 from 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( P@@ FT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of for@@ ged relations between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.4 % ) and placebo ( 2.@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted drug effects are listed in table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al @-@ compul@@ sive disorder of customs , was associated with kidney dys@@ functions ( i.e. an increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ ins ) and in rare cases as ac@@ al kidney failure . &quot;
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in the Ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of the patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the lab findings , the temporary ap@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was placed at 2.3 % of the patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical trial treated patients compared to 21 % of the patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies treated . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had an extra 60 % reduced risk of vert@@ ebral body . compared to placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0,@@ 00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip implants A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a pointed out an equally consistent effect over three years , which resulted in a by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip tours . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a raised the bone density at the steering vert@@ ali@@ c acid , hip , and at the dist@@ al radius compared to placebo therapy significantly to all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;

bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pelvic crest .
a micro@@ computer @-@ tom@@ atic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo an increase in the traditional bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ cular bone architecture .
bone usage mark@@ er The bones @-@ specific alkal@@ ine collagen ( B@@ 1@@ NP ) in Ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in Ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients in perio@@ dic intervals during the duration of studies .
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dosage A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly increased by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D mirror were not been rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 , i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before the in@@ fusion . &quot;
overall plac@@ ality stood at 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment compared to placebo @-@ treatment the BM@@ D in total th@@ ens and pe@@ ws as at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment conducted more than 24 months compared to placebo @-@ treatment at an increase in BM@@ D by 5.2 % on the total th@@ ens and about 4.3 % at the Schen@@ kel@@ h@@ as .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized 50@@ 8 men and assessed with 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated males compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to the weekly gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate referred to the percentage of the steering vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison to the output value . &quot;

11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Zol@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg risk cancer during 2 months was detected in two six month comparison studies .
&quot; in the combined results after 6 months , a similar acceptance of pain strength and pain kill@@ ers was observed in comparison to the output value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
&quot; patients who were classified as Respon@@ sible study at the end of the six month study ( on the therapy ) , could be included in an observ@@ able phase . &quot;
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ age treated patients , the therapeutic an@@ alogy was attended by 141 der with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 71 of the patients with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ er , to be maintained in the middle duration of the observation phase of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multilingual 5 and 15 minutes lasting In@@ fu@@ sions from 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of customs ic acid in 64 patients received the following pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independently . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ing rapidly took off on &lt; 10 % of maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;

&quot; the early release phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ - values ) probably represent the fast resistance in the bone and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours there are 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the overall body Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the acceptance of the Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation against time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance from cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ eric systems is unlikely because customs ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by humans , because it is not even more direct and / or irreversible , material dependent In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;

this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive kidney disorder up to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance to 35 ml / min no dosage adjustment of the customs ic acid .
because for heavy kidney disorder ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only constra@@ int data is available for this population .

&quot; acet@@ account is applied to the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) , in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not shown . • It can be used together with another diabe@@ tic medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( in particular , overweight patients ) can be used with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ ated dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ stoff or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ actic or ins@@ ulin may be maintained except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ants and ins@@ ulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s bodily ins@@ ulin can be improved and the blood sugar levels , which makes type 2 diabetes better set . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the effectiveness of acet@@ account was examined in tri@@ ple@@ Therap@@ y ; in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff , in addition they received either accounts or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value , which allows the blood sugar to be reduced in use of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ a study , the effect of the additional gift of accounts for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , whereas the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of accounts and ins@@ ulin was examined at 2@@ 89 patients , the patients , the accounts in addition to ins@@ ulin values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who were additionally placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper air@@ ways ( refriger@@ ation ) , weight gain and hypo@@ cris@@ y ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; account must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ( high level of ket@@ one ) - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos are to serve as an alternative to standard therapy with met@@ form@@ in patients with met@@ form@@ in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 the European Commission shared the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited permit approval for the in@@ securities of accounts in the whole European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , curved and carry on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the in@@ scription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also displayed for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with ins@@ ulin and in which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility is un@@ suitable ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence at least of a risk factor ( e.g. former coron@@ ary heart disease or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dosage and increase the dose of the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or eyel@@ id , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and eyel@@ id if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease has been performed .
&quot; in this study an increase in reports on heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output of liver @-@ liver ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of norm@@ ality ) , or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror up to 3 @-@ times the upper limit of norm@@ ality is increased , the liver enz@@ ym@@ eric values are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient symptoms developed , which point to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , loss , loss , loss of appetite and / or darker har@@ n , are the liver enz@@ ym@@ eric values . &quot;
the decision whether the patient treatment should be continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be led up to the pre @-@ run parameters of clinical evaluation .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven to be given by fats and is associated with hydr@@ ation in some cases . &quot;
as a result of a tick @-@ style under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one entered a slightly reduction in the middle bun@@ ni@@ glo@@ omy ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.@@ 1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in comparative controlled trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ o@@ Bell &apos;s by 3 @-@ 4 % and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ s around 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity , in patients , the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as a dual @-@ branch or triple combination therapy with ins@@ ulin therapy , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the market launch was reported under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ onen , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , on the occurrence or deterioration of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ul@@ um with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , however , if patients report the possibility of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic declaration should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages of unwanted events relating to bon@@ ded , controlled , double @-@ blind trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the frac@@ ture frac@@ ture amoun@@ ted to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , and 1,@@ 1 frei@@ ghter for women who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , questionn@@ aires , with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2,5 % ; 0,5 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient @-@ years ) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , treatment is reduced ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
studies for examining the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on the pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ er are not expected . &quot;
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ us ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulting in an increase in the Au@@ c of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ ing ) resulted in lowering the Au@@ c of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to it due to treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one that dimin@@ ished in pregnancy , hypertension and increased ins@@ ulin resistance to the cervi@@ cal and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the feder@@ acy growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 , single cases : unknown ( made of these data not invaluable ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary transformation of the tur@@ g@@ or and the board of the lens , as it can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ dri@@ des entered into the upper limit of the standard range just like placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease the frequency of a severe heart failure less than Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; since the market launch has rarely been reported on heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been applied in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure . &quot;
&quot; it has been conducted a summary analysis of messages of unwanted events with random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated with compared groups . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of running pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2,5 % ) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; intake the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Fri@@ ated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin of liver , fats and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and boo@@ sts the peripher@@ al gluten in the event of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the im@@ let of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.3 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the start of therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of patients to be maintained ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo@@ controlled study about 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were inadequate despite three @-@ month optimization phase with ins@@ ulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced to 0.@@ 45 % , compared to patients who continue to receive ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant withdrawal of the Alb@@ um@@ ine / Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ as compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was checked in a small , pending examination of type @-@ 2 diabe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials were observed in comparison to placebo a reduction in the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels , as well as neg@@ li@@ gi@@ bly , but clin@@ ically significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plas@@ tik gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo was found under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol levels , whereas in met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de dimin@@ ished values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ as levels , this applies both over an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease in groups that have had over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; according to oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly resor@@ bed , with the top con@@ centric pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma as a rule 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is to effectiveness in approximately three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; Inter@@ ac@@ tional studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ us ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) increases or lo@@ wers the plas@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; according to oral application of radio@@ active mark@@ up Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the Mar@@ ker was primarily found in the subjects ( 55 % ) and a lower scale in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the middle plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation period of un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to the people 5 @-@ 6 hours and those of the entire active met@@ alli@@ zation lies at 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plastic concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its met@@ alli@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function , whereby the ranks of the or@@ ical Clear@@ ance of the cervi@@ cal is similar . &quot;
&quot; in to@@ xi@@ al studies occurred on mice , rats , dogs and monkeys coinci@@ ding after repeated administration with Hem@@ p , an@@ a@@ emia and sealed ex@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , dimin@@ ished in the form of hyper@@ ins@@ ulin and increased ins@@ ulin resistance to the cervi@@ cal and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the feder@@ acy growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induc@@ ed in R@@ atte increased inci@@ dences of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( with male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary tract .
in an animal model of family aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of colon@@ ists .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the in@@ scription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
&quot; the frac@@ ture frac@@ ture amoun@@ ted to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , and 1,@@ 1 frei@@ ghter for women who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , questionn@@ aires , with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2,5 % ; 0,5 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient @-@ years ) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in a further study over two years , the effects of a combination of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were examined . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over 1 year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant withdrawal of the Alb@@ um@@ ine / Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ as compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but improved in addition to the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de mirror , this has an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as on the hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was missing the target with regard to their primary end@@ point , which has a combination of the overall plac@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal syndrome , stroke amp@@ utation and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arteries , put the results close that with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one are not associated with cardiovascular long @-@ term risks . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ dre@@ aph@@ ane was tested in a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as can produce no ins@@ ulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to utilize the ins@@ ulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ zed hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ dre@@ aph@@ ane led to a withdrawal of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similar to a different human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
Ac@@ dre@@ aph@@ ane should not be applied in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; besides , the doses of Ac@@ dre@@ aph@@ ane must be adapted , if it is administered along with a number of other medicines which can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is the package to be found ) . &quot;
the committee on human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of acet@@ ap@@ hor@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes over the risks prevail .
October 2002 the European Commission shared the Company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S received approval for the in@@ securities of Ac@@ dre@@ aph@@ ane in the whole European Union .

&quot; if the ure@@ ter level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once daily . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , still toxicity failures can occur ; therefore , patients will be recommended at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic still further medicines for preventing gyp@@ sum . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ @-@ transplan@@ tation because it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients was attended , the effectiveness of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared with one placebo ( hypo@@ medi@@ kam@@ ents ) and from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( other medicines for treating hypertension ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Adenauer ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol each year . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
&quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients , whose ur@@ inary tract has been under 6 mg / d@@ l in the blood during the last three measurements . &quot;
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic carried out at a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once took over 120 mg once daily in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was at 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no one of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adenauer ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart protection , there is also an increased risk of certain side @-@ effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; in the conclusion , the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic in lowering the ur@@ inary tract was more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;

&quot; if the ser@@ um bar@@ esp@@ ace can be considered 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , can be considered a dosage increased to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe ren@@ al functioning , the effectiveness and safety have not been completely investigated ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and young people , because there are no experiences with children and young people , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot;

liver diseases Dur@@ ing the clinical trials of phase 3 were observed light nu@@ is@@ ations of liver function at F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to perform a liver function before the start of the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ treatment and in the further course depending on the sound@@ ing refund ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ in Z@@ ine was not conducted an in@@ effective studies to F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ation can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a shirt of the met@@ alli@@ zation of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .

&quot; 7 Off@@ ene long @-@ term studies In the open long @-@ term loading studies , 9@@ 06 patients have been treated for up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 2 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the events related during long @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in the studies of phase 3 ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events have been reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups a total of more than once and , in patients , who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient @-@ years ) , according to it occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment related events have either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses either at all or with a lower frequency :

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was described in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study as described below ) which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary aspir@@ ation point was in every study of the patients participating in which the last three month of certain ser@@ um s@@ lu@@ sion@@ ers are &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 8 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 8 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ ment to study of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; the AP@@ EX study showed up to 6 mg / d@@ l ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) the statisti@@ cally significant superiority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with traditional cans Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) . &quot;
the F@@ act study showed a significant improvement in treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily compared with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um incre@@ mental &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) , were summar@@ ised for the analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
the reduction of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sä@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els on &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the physician &apos;s visit to 2 and permanently maintain the entire treatment .
&quot; 50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function restric@@ ts The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney function .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy point was at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clinical significant differences in the process of ser@@ um @-@ acid @-@ con@@ centric , irrespective of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney distur@@ ban@@ ces ) . &quot;
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um @-@ acid re@@ con@@ centric ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l &apos;E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( W@@ eline ) a ser@@ um @-@ con@@ dens@@ ation of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
&quot; the data collected in two years resulted in an open extension study of phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients had needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 treatment ( i.e. , more than 97 % of patients need no treatment against a gyp@@ sum ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the size of gyp@@ sum , which at 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the gyp@@ sum up to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 0 % ) and also received in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; at healthy pro@@ ban@@ ces increased the maximum plastic concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ centric time curve ( Au@@ c ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration , easier and multi @-@ pl@@ ers of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , it is observed for f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at an increase in Au@@ c , which is larger than the dos@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multi @-@ pl@@ ural doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.@@ 0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clinical significant change in the percentage of ser@@ um @-@ acid re@@ centr@@ ation has been observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state @-@ distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is located in the area of 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
Plas@@ ma@@ ap@@ rot@@ ein@@ ation of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ ine ) and is reached via the concentration width that is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vit@@ ro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ nia , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 showed that F@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 are formed , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ e@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ distinctive F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose found in the urine as an imm@@ utable F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative met@@ alli@@ zation and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ alli@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of urine , approximately 45 % of the dose found themselves as imm@@ utable F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative met@@ alli@@ zation and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ alli@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
special patient groups of kidney failure after taking multi @-@ pl@@ ess@@ ation doses from 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe non @-@ failure in@@ suffici@@ ency changed the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at not in proportion to proportions with normal kidney function . &quot;
the average total au@@ c of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 @-@ times of 7.5 μ / h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ / h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

age There were no significant changes with regard to the Au@@ c of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ alli@@ zation after in@@ ges@@ tion of multiple sclerosis by AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger proportions .
&quot; car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ ese , impairment of fer@@ til@@ ity with male rats has been found a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary tract ( Transi@@ tional cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ oma ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in high do@@ ves , with approximately the 11 @-@ fold exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are viewed as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ met@@ alli@@ zation and urine composition and is not relevant for the clinical application .
it has been noted that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in or@@ ical doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day does not have effect on the fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses , which was roughly 4,@@ 3@@ - triple of human therapeutic exposure , maternal toxicity , came along with a reduction in charge and a development delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in tra@@ ging rats with expos@@ ures , which amoun@@ ted about the 4,@@ 3 @-@ times and in tra@@ ging rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions that bore approximately the 13 @-@ fold of human therapeutic exposure , escaped no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ opause in which a risk is for a low vitamin D mirror .
&quot; patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin supplement ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may take up after the first food intake of the day , the early 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in pharmaceuticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of boosting vitamin D .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients were treated with low vitamin D @-@ mirror in the patient who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who took exclusively Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also placed data that suggest that in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose is exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal muscle ( muscles , bones , or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive disorders ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cer@@ ation , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , ul@@ cer@@ ation ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , pro@@ dig@@ al ( b@@ aking ha@@ ste ) , tri@@ but@@ ing abdom@@ en ( blo@@ wer &apos;s belly ) as well as sour . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or one of the other components may not be applied AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in case of diseases of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ a@@ emia ( ger@@ low calcium levels ) or in patients who can not stand up at least 30 minutes or sit down . &quot;
Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 the European Commission shared the company Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; D@@ oh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the in@@ securities of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the whole European Union .
&quot; capsule form , white until broken white tablets , marked with the tear of a button on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or sub@@ mitting medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
following critics are exactly to follow to decrease the risk of os@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side @-@ effects ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed up after the date of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not cr@@ ush the tablet , as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not be taken before the first food intake of the day , the early 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal blood vessels or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal epitheli@@ um , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ la@@ sty , can be given only with special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as oil @-@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , os@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sion , were rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al cor@@ ks , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required an ambul@@ ance assignment ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore note attention to all the signs and symptoms to point out the reactions and symptoms that should be pointed out on possible ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gie , pain in the lo@@ op@@ ting or retro@@ gressive pain or sub@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing so@@ d@@ burn and medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of severe os@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who don &apos;t take the medication correctly and / or it according to the occurrence of symptoms that point to a ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all the risks to be passed to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk has been found , some of them were severe ( after market launch ) stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and associated with complications ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the j@@ aw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy ime was predominantly given bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the subscri@@ ber of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who require a ru@@ fer@@ ous surgical procedure , reducing the risk of a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the Kie@@ j@@ aw . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the prescri@@ bing doctor is decisive for treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they should take the tablet by taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE within the next morning after they have noticed their om@@ is@@ ance .
&quot; they should not take two tablets at the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day . &quot;
other diseases which affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should be treated before the start of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplement , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some or@@ ale drugs can affect the resistance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait after the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interim studies were not performed , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken together in clinical studies together with a large number of usually prescribed medicines , without being clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither to be used during pregnancy or nursing women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at leave no reference to directly im@@ partial effects in terms of pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the Kie@@ j@@ aw was reported in patients under Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports have been reported by cancer patients , but also in Oste@@ opor@@ osis patients . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ vag@@ raf is administered adult patients to which kidney or liver transplan@@ ted , to prevent a dis@@ assembly of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ ft and data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study was submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Ad@@ vag@@ raf with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transp@@ l@@ ant was destroyed after a treatment duration of one year ( by example , for example , a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , shorter studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients were conducted with liver transplan@@ tation , such as Ad@@ vag@@ raf in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot;

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy and the treatment of transp@@ l@@ ant patients should arrange this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences from the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transp@@ l@@ apping or to an increased incidence of side @-@ effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ oh@@ s . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of formulation or regime should only be made under the narro@@ wer control of a medical physician ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; in consequence of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug surveillance and appropriate dosage adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
&quot; the dosage of Ad@@ vaginal was supposed to be primarily based on the clinical assessment of marriage and toler@@ ability in the individual case , and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below ) &quot;
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vaginal , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; 4 the systemic exposure , measured by day 4 was comparable to the levels , with both formulations both at kidney and le@@ ber@@ transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after Tran@@ splan@@ tation under Ad@@ vag@@ raf in order to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate after@@ math @-@ phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vaginal Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can last several days until the Ste@@ ady state is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient is not allowed in the first post@@ operative phase no oral treatment , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrations to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) are introduced with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the application of the adaptation of the transp@@ l@@ ation must be maintained , therefore , the immune system must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of the or@@ ical therapy cannot be stated . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis The or@@ ale Ad@@ vaginal therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further tin adap@@ tations may be required later since the pharmaceutical @-@ oc@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transp@@ l@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transp@@ l@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation The or@@ ale Ad@@ vaginal therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage Recommen@@ dation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf &apos;s must be converted from twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Ad@@ vaginal capsules upon a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ raf , this shift in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
Ni@@ er@@ - and liver transplan@@ tation after a change from other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants at Ad@@ vag@@ raf once daily has to start the treatment with the recommended initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ tation .
&quot; cardi@@ ac transplan@@ tation by adult patients , who are placed on Ad@@ vaginal , is an or@@ ale Initi@@ al dose of 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily to take place in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other transc@@ end@@ ents , although there are no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ aries in pulmon@@ ary , pan@@ acea and o@@ genic transplan@@ ted patients in a or@@ ical initi@@ al@@ d@@ dose of 0,@@ 2 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transplan@@ ts of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / day for application . &quot;
&quot; Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in special patients groups , patient with reduced liver function , in the targeted area may be required in patients with severe liver distur@@ ban@@ ces to be a her@@ ing of the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function exer@@ ts no influence on the Phar@@ m@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um incre@@ mental level , a calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ali@@ ance and monitoring of the ureth@@ ra ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ raf In the conversion of a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advised ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the valley level in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case of the helpl@@ ess Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirror @-@ controls .
&quot; it is recommended to carry out frequent controls of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talent during the first two weeks after Tran@@ splan@@ tation , followed by perio@@ dic controls during the maintenance therapy . &quot;
blood level of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled by conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vaginal and Dos@@ age adap@@ tion to change modifications of immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or at the simultaneous application of substances which could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ thorough@@ bred centr@@ ation ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; since Ad@@ vaginal had a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady state has entered . &quot;
the data in clinical trials can conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the level of blood does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the level of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lies in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts normally in the area of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and during and sav@@ vy patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ ts were usually used blood con@@ centric in the area of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this led to serious unwanted events , including transplan@@ tation , or other side @-@ effects which can occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of formulation or regime should only be made under the narro@@ wer control of a medical physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation , proved against other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ant drugs , there are still no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the transp@@ l@@ ation of adult cardi@@ ac transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ ts , there are still no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation Ad@@ vag@@ raf before . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions which can lead to a de@@ composition of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the cur@@ is@@ weed ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) contain , or other herbal remedies during a treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly me@@ tic@@ ulous monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood offered because the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f it was a cardi@@ om@@ yo@@ path@@ ie referred to as cardi@@ om@@ yo@@ path@@ ia , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart suffering , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infection , hydr@@ ation and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin lesi@@ ons by means of suitable clothing or using a solar protection by means of a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for pris@@ es such as head@@ ache , changed consciousness levels , cro@@ ws and visual dys@@ functions , should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; da Ad@@ vaginal spro@@ cket , retar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose contain , in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ in@@ tolerant , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ mal@@ ware of particular caution is offered . &quot;
simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies which are known as inhibit@@ or or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and consequently reduce blood flow of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
&quot; it is therefore recommended to change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood mirror at the simultaneous gift of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism , and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintaining even@@ ly concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly pronounced inter@@ play has been associated with An@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol , and with the Macro@@ lid An@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ i ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmaceutical studies conducted that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal di@@ version , results . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ quality pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as is used by acute separation actions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to imp@@ el metabolism .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us desc@@ ends the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thereby increase the hormonal exposure , is especially careful when decisions about recep@@ tive actions is especially careful . &quot;
the results of animal try have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of investigations on transp@@ l@@ ant patients provide no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants an increased risk of unwanted events relating to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the newborn is recommended to possible effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the newborn ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns ) ; i.e. :
the in@@ effective profile of immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants can often be seen because of the underlying disease of patients and the simultaneous treatment with a number of other medicines .
&quot; in the following , the side @-@ effects are listed after its frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( incidence on the basis of available data is not invaluable ) . &quot;

&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water @-@ soluble and the high bond of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma @-@ red rot@@ um can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; drug mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level will be conve@@ yed the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by its bond to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ K@@ B@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the connection of the connection in the cell . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependency in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duc@@ tions because of the T @-@ cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ ber genes .

factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rite level and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ developed faction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or to be responsible for treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids at the guided strengthening of the met@@ alli@@ zation by the higher clearing @-@ edges .

&quot; Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of blood vessels in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII , inn@@ ate blood cl@@ utter disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application are aimed at whether advoc@@ ating bleeding or prevent bleeding in surgical procedures is applied .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood pressure problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but by a method which is referred to as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell , where a gene ( DNA ) has been brought in to the formation of the human scent factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is approved in another in the European Union , called Re@@ pub@@ ates , but it is otherwise established , so that the medicine includes no proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was examined using bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was rated in the prevention of blood vessels in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies opposite factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human sc@@ inn@@ ate factor VIII , Maus@@ - or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; March 2004 , the European Commission submitted to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG received approval for the in@@ securities of Adv@@ ate in the whole of the European Union . &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy refers to the severity of the factor VIII century according to the place and extent of the blood and the clinical condition of the patient .
&quot; in the following hem@@ ost@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VIII and activity in the appropriate period should not sink into the specified plasma ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / d@@ l ) . &quot;
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk to the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment process , to control the maximum dose and the frequency of injections , the appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ed is applied . &quot;
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII to reach various in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ times .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis Z@@ ur @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be doses between 20 and 40 that is estimated by factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ c activities is not achieved , or if the bleeding is not master@@ ed with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to prove an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic interventions must be wei@@ ghed . &quot;
the transmission speed is to be directed to the patient where the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ codi@@ fying activity of factor VIII oriented Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; developing the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 expos@@ ures is most important and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in case of pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure and an@@ am@@ nesty , known in@@ hi@@ bit@@ able development , by changing from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re @-@ occur by ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of the hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) that have been infected with previously untreated patients , which have a higher risk to education of inhibit@@ ors , headaches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( incidence on the basis of available data is not invaluable ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the un@@ expected waste of the blood pressure factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els entered post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ operative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE In@@ fusion .
&quot; the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting has been maintained during all the time , and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post@@ operative day . &quot;
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII &lt; 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 Ex@@ positioning days with A@@ DV@@ ATE a low In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.@@ 4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition one of 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of 6 years and diagnosed is severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII &lt; 2 % ) according to previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
&quot; in advance , not treated patients of an ongoing clinical trial conducted 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE , patients inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII . &quot;
the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of anti@@ body proteins against these proteins ; laboratory @-@ parameters and painted side effects .
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of anti@@ body levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , but otherwise there have no signs or symptoms reported on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were isolated over the appearance of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash , and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ y@@ tes reported in several repeated product positions within the study . &quot;

December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited shared the Committee on human@@ ization agents ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company takes its application to approval for the in@@ securities from Adv@@ oc@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; however , the breast , the brain , the bone or the meadow @-@ parts ( tissues which combines the other structures in the body , surrounds and base ) . &quot;
&quot; this is a kind of virus that genetically modified , that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ oc@@ in is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; which has been altered so that there can be no copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ oc@@ in could have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , and so they should allow the cancer cells to form the normal pH @-@ protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is made from the un@@ def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 @-@ Gen , is usually contributes to restoration of corrupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is faul@@ ty , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company laid data from a study with a patient , on the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of under@@ mining , into the bone and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company on the questions asked , some questions were still un@@ solved . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of initial documents , the CH@@ MP tag creates a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
after the CH@@ MP opinion not sufficiently proved that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits for patients .
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the pharmaceutical means in the body , the type of administration , and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ oc@@ can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company won &apos;t be aware of the CH@@ MP , whether the recall consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials , or as &quot; com@@ fy Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ oc@@ in . &quot;
changed active ingredient &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled that one of the effective components immediately and the other is slowly released over a few hours .
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s ( gras@@ shop@@ pers , through an allergy to pol@@ len , resulting inflammation of the nose @-@ off infection ) in patients with nas@@ al swelling ( hidden nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and young people aged 12 years old , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose @-@ grin@@ ders ( hidden nose ) , are sealed . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be retri@@ eved by means of the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the most effective means were the changes in the severity of the ha@@ unting symptoms that were reported by patients before the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the trial , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and evaluated with a standard sc@@ ala as heavy the symptoms in the last 12 hours were . &quot;
&quot; considering all hypo@@ cris@@ u@@ pf@@ ymp@@ tom@@ less than the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients who took ac@@ in@@ a@@ ze , over a decrease of the symptoms around 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who were pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nose @-@ grin@@ ders was seen , patients under the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a allevi@@ ation of symptoms around 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patient who took the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( cardi@@ ac infection ) , swelling , fatigue , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may not be in@@ sensitive with patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other constitu@@ ents , against in@@ ep@@ in@@ ants or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( other medicines for the treatment of allergies ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may also not be applied in patients that suffer from a bot@@ her@@ angle glau@@ coma ( increased water pressure ) , cardi@@ ac disease or vas@@ cular disease ( hyper@@ blood pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ blood pressure ) , or had a risk for a hem@@ ost@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission announced the company SP Europe approval for the in@@ securities of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without breaking down , break or che@@ wing ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should be applied due to the lack of data about in@@ conceivable and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) not in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use of time to 10 days , as long @-@ term waste the activity of pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease in time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the sli@@ ps in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients that are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combination of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , like Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Er@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ pping , Phen@@ y@@ le@@ Phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collective , and the data are not sufficient to speak corresponding recommendations for dosage . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction , and the data are not sufficient to speak corresponding recommendations for dosage . &quot;
&quot; patients must be informed about the treatment in the appearance of a hyper@@ ton@@ ia or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st , or of Pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a rein@@ forcement of headaches ) must be dropped . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patients groups , patients under D@@ IG@@ ITA@@ L@@ IS • patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder hal@@ so@@ b@@ ance or bronze rab@@ bits in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before implementing der@@ mat@@ ological testing , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka can also reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin actions or reduce them in its extent . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol have also been administered , however , were not clin@@ ically relevant exchange effects or changes in the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests could not be found significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether or not that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone or with alcohol was taken .
&quot; the enzymes for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible Enzy@@ me has not been identified , so that interactions with other medicines can not be excluded completely . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ ors of P @-@ gly@@ co@@ rot@@ eins .
the un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able application of the aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured of experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however no increase in the frequency of abnorm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
&quot; since Re@@ production studies on animals can not always be transferred to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ c characteristics of pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , the patients should be enligh@@ tened that in very rare cases it can come to a di@@ zz@@ iness which can lead to a impairment of traffic van@@ ity or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms can vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , compres@@ sing , cardiovascular abnorm@@ alities ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with potential suspension . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , sc@@ values , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tension , euph@@ oria , fatigue , tr@@ ance , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ di@@ ous pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ aps , ten@@ dons , and hyper@@ ton@@ ia or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly probable in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , p@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , Hau@@ tr@@ ine , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ ton@@ ic cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 and IL @-@ 13 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mac@@ ular cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Eagle molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin at end@@ ot@@ hel@@ per cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study involving adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg no influence on standard measurement output , including the rein@@ forcement of subjective sle@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks connected to the fly . &quot;
controlled clinical trials have been determined at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily in no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to placebo .
&quot; the or@@ ale application of pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ in in recommended dosage can cause further person@@ om@@ im@@ e@@ tic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal @-@ allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets received . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ am@@ in@@ antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determines the basis of the total scores for the symptom ( except Nasen@@ s@@ ander @-@ swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the down@@ turn effect , determined by the nose @-@ s@@ ling swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation groups . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a single dose study to Phar@@ m@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration . &quot;
according to the per@@ oral application from Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze at healthy pro@@ gangs of 14 days the fly @-@ balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in day 10 is reached . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which has been performed with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult pro@@ ban@@ ces , has been noted that four Pro@@ gangs of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in badly changed . &quot;
a component @-@ Inter@@ ac@@ tional study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and Au@@ c ) from pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine according to the sole Gift of pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was equivalent to exposure to gift of a Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on security pro@@ phy@@ l@@ ology , for toxicity of repeti@@ tive gift , for genom@@ ics and to Re@@ productive Tox@@ ic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , however , do not recognize any particular dangers for the human being . &quot;
&quot; the combination has no greater toxicity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and at rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ gen .

&quot; in total eight studies of about 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies on seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients , which also had as@@ thma ) . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness has been measured by the changing of symptoms ( itch , number and size of the s@@ add@@ les , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body values the sy@@ rup , the solution to inhal@@ ation and melting in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; allergic rh@@ initi@@ s led when the results of all studies have been taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of the symptom of 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patient who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria was the withdrawal of the symptom from six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % with the patients treated patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or one of the other components . &quot;
January 2001 commissioned the European Commission of the Company SP Europe approval for the in@@ securities of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union .
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy approval by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be stopped according to the previous disease and can be finished after the end of the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed at their re @-@ occur .
&quot; in the pers@@ ists allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended during the aller@@ ding time a continuous treatment . &quot;
clinical relevant interactions have not been noted in the context of clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets which were administered in addition to the er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study was not reinforced during the current intake of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the high @-@ performance effect of alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , patients should be enligh@@ tened that in very rare cases it can come to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to an impairment of traffic van@@ ity or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic methods , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with as@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequently used side @-@ effects , which was reported more often than with placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ dry ( 0,@@ 8 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years the most common side @-@ effect headaches . this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and with 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with placebo .
&quot; in a multi@@ disciplinary study , administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( ninete@@ en clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ sy cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 and IL @-@ 13 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mac@@ ular cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Eagle molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin at end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple sclerosis , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was administered in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was administered in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ninth of the clinical dose ) over ten days showed himself no extension of Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; at a single dose study involving adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg had no control on standard measurement output , including the rein@@ forcement of subjective sle@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks connected to the fly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as kidney , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching the nose , it@@ tery and redness of the eyes as well as itch on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall level of freight for the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ economy ti@@ vi@@ tis , t@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ished by seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s caused by seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic bor@@ der@@ aria was examined for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ological forms regardless of the ae@@ ti@@ ology is similar to the various forms and chronic patients are easier to recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since the history of history is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular disorders , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in except for chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria also results in other forms of pri@@ tic@@ aria to improve symptoms , this will be confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria , ast@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the her@@ ing of size and number of p@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose @-@ inter@@ v@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients , who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the itch by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated by placebo .
&quot; the treatment with as@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of the sleep and the wax , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate this variable . &quot;
&quot; in an pharmaceuticals study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s in population , was achieved in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
there are no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant grief after the daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzymes for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible Enzy@@ me has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhibit@@ ors in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ ors of P @-@ gly@@ co@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie breakfast ) does not rely on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
the clinical trials conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in conducted clinical trials in a comparable level of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and from Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ ms , toxicity of repeti@@ tive Gift , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and for Re@@ productive Tox@@ ic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in leave no particular dangers for the human being . &quot;
&quot; coloured movie ( includes L@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mon@@ oh@@ ydr@@ ate , hy@@ prom@@ o 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , color@@ less film ( containing hy@@ prom@@ o , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , Car@@ nau@@ ba@@ de , geb@@ lei@@ gh wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by infection in children under 2 years ( see below paragraph 4.@@ 4 ) and that no data is available that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with as@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; besides the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , in the diagnosis the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical examination and corresponding laboratory tests should play a role . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children aged between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in restricted and learn a higher sub@@ stan@@ tive load ( see below 5.2 ) .
&quot; the security of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is restricted to metabol@@ ise , is identical to those with children that are normal metabolic . &quot;
&quot; this medicine includes Sac@@ char@@ ose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with inherited problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose in@@ tolerant , glucose , glucose absorption or a Sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ Is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine . &quot;
clinical relevant interactions have been given in the context of clinical studies with as@@ eri@@ us tablets that were administered in addition to the er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study was not reinforced during the current intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the high @-@ performance effect of alcohol ( see below paragraph 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of the side @-@ effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup Group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; clinical studies with adults and young people in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic methods , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with as@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi@@ disciplinary study involving adults and adolescents , administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( ninete@@ en clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years old who came to an anti@@ hist@@ am@@ in@@ therapy for an anti@@ hist@@ am@@ in@@ therapy received by 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic methods and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in adults can be extr@@ ap@@ pered with adults to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multi@@ plying in adults and young people , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;

&quot; the spread of this constra@@ ined phen@@ otype was comparable with adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ disciplinary study with Sir@@ up@@ bringing in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are restricted . &quot;
the load ( au@@ c ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with a season half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant ingredient in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and young people .

&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of A@@ eri@@ us Sch@@ mel@@ z@@ tab@@ lett If you have forgotten your dose , take it as soon as possible , and then follow the normal treatment plan . &quot;
&quot; after launch of A@@ eri@@ us , very rarely has been reported on cases of severe allergic reactions ( difficulties when breathing , wh@@ ist@@ ling breathing , it@@ ching , Nes@@ sel@@ fl@@ ing and swelling ) and rash . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us solution for admission is displayed for children between the ages of 1 and 11 years , young people ( 12 years and older ) and adults , older people . &quot;
&quot; when the solution to one application is attached to one application injection for preparations with scal@@ ations , you can use this alternatively to take the appropriate amount of solution to enter . &quot;
&quot; regarding the treatment of treatment your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , under which you suffer and will decide how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us solution to one . &quot;
&quot; however , in children under 2 years diar@@ rho@@ ea , fever and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness of side effects were reported during adult fatigue , drying and headaches more often than with placebo . &quot;
&quot; 97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for installation is ob@@ tainable in bottles with child @-@ safe distribution cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
the 150 ml pack size is a measuring spo@@ on or a application sy@@ ringe to access with sc@@ aling of 2.5 m@@ l@@ - and 5 ml cans .
June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed the company &apos;s application for approval from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ In@@ flu@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and elderly persons to protect flu , caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the In@@ flu@@ enza @-@ A virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine that could cause prior to a trunk of influenza virus , which could cause a future pan@@ demic . &quot;
&quot; flu pan@@ demic breaks off when a new strain of flu @-@ virus emerging , which can easily spread from person to person , because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
after filing of the vaccine the immune system recognises the parts of the flu @-@ virus as &quot; body @-@ alien &quot; and forms anti@@ body .
&quot; in this way , the immune system is later able to form a contact with a flu @-@ virus this gene@@ alo@@ t of faster antibodies . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane ke@@ epers of the virus was separated with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as body alien ) and used as a part of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study had not been carried out under &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ demic vaccines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical test and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like further information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also component of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in combination with other anti @-@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by the human immune response virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which are infected with the acquired immun@@ ode@@ ficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to one , but this cannot be taken along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked , which has taken anti @-@ viral medicines of the patient before , and the likelihood is that the virus is addressed to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which are taken along with twice daily 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti @-@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase depends on the body weight . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase is reduced in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV @-@ quantity in blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; AIDS is not to heal AIDS , however , the immune system of the immune system and thus also delay the development of associated infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti @-@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , studied in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , who previously did not have been treated with protests . &quot;
&quot; this with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 20@@ 6 adults , who had previously taken prot@@ eas@@ ants , with other protests . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients suffering from non @-@ demonstr@@ able concentrations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ al last ) or the modification of the virus last after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously taken no protein previously , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral last below 400 copies / ml as among placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children decreased A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the virus last , but with the children who were treated earlier with prot@@ rac@@ ers , very few to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with protests and increased medicine A@@ gener@@ ase , the Vir@@ al last after 16 @-@ week treatment is just as effective as other protests previously : &quot;
&quot; in the patient with HIV , which was resistant to four other def@@ ences , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the Vir@@ t@@ last after four weeks as with the patients who continued their previous prot@@ rac@@ ers : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and nar@@ gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be applied in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ weed ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are just as controlled as axi@@ ase and are used in high concentrations in the blood of health harmful . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , the A@@ gener@@ ase is taking , the risk of a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ( abnorm@@ alities in the distribution of the body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection that are caused by the reco@@ vering immune system ) . &quot;
the committee on human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years towards the risk .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic los@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee identified that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have a prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally admitted under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information is available . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission signed the G@@ lax@@ o Group limited approval for the in@@ securities of A@@ gener@@ ase in the whole European Union .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ eas@@ ants ( PI ) for adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
for usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered for pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ks@@ creen along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral Res@@ istence and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r as a solution to one @-@ take is around 14 % less than a capsule ; therefore are A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ tion on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules can be used without the ampli@@ fiers additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ks@@ creen ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the pharmaceuticals , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other def@@ ences were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data about in@@ conceivable and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose should be reduced to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver liver to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver distur@@ ban@@ ces to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application is to be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver disorder , in patients with severe liver functional disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ig@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations which contain Johann@@ is@@ weed ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk reduction of reduced plastic concentrations and a decreased therapeutic effect of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can also continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be used with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , an increased risk of severe liver interactions with potentially deadly course . &quot;
&quot; for the event of simultaneous anti @-@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of these medicines . &quot;
patients with existing reduced liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ one or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ des , which will not be recommended via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the potential benefits of treatment the risk of systemic coron@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ ling effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and sup@@ compression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
since the contrac@@ tion of the H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ vast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ ine and Sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the elevated risk of m@@ yo@@ path@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
&quot; 4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ ality rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the substance evaluation . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to decreased plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ing of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills may be altered but the information is not sufficient to be able to assess the nature of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ en@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium deficiency symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxicity , due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ cos@@ ity in children , this formulation was contra@@ indicated in children under one age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patients groups . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 5 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cos@@ ity is involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ eas@@ ants , was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an exc@@ itation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases which were required to treatment medicines which are associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug addic@@ ts factors , such as a longer continual anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and the associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; on h@@ ub@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ agon@@ ists , reports of a increase of blood vessels including spontaneous pol@@ mat@@ ologists and her@@ b@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , a inflammatory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ ist infections can lead to serious clinical trials or deterioration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ isation , higher Body Mass Index ) , cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term waste of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width an@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a small therapeutic width and also represent sub @-@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ig@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with small therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are mostly connected via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to increased plasma bars with he@@ avi@@ ating and / or life @-@ threatening effects .
&quot; it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by a 82 % reduction in the au@@ c of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to lead to a resource development . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to equ@@ ate the humili@@ ating plastic bars through a dosage increase of other protein inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often unwanted effects were observed in the liver . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ weed ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um mirror of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations by Johann@@ is@@ weed ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient takes on a cur@@ b , the am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r@@ mirror is and , if possible , to check the virus load and dis@@ miss the cur@@ rant . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ence below ) .
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ max with 30 % humili@@ ated , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered in combination with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily applied to the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as . &quot;
52 % humili@@ ates if Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) administered in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in combination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; intake recommended for simultaneous administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra can not be given , however , there is a narro@@ wer surveillance recommended as the efficacy and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study conducted on the use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , due to the fantasy component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in is suggested that the revenue of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gener@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , at the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) does not require dosage adjustment . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both protein signs is low .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other def@@ ences and available limited data can be suspected that ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine may lo@@ wers the ser@@ um@@ eration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these medicines should be utilized at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the decreased or possibly subtropical plasma @-@ bars could be less effective . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines will be applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made , as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of combination of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and k@@ ra@@ viol@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( Au@@ c ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thereby a rise in associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin associated side effects .
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin can be administered along with A@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is advised , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
&quot; pharmaceutical studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been performed , but the plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ing of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ en@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily resulted in an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily with a simultaneous application of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily with no simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that can be listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , potentially cause interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions which are linked to these medicines , if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ ants it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , since it can come to Res@@ or@@ atory disorders . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ ants that are known as an enzyme ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of the plas@@ tic@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ ers , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , g@@ odi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can increase 10 by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and tox@@ ins of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase its plas@@ tic@@ concentrations , and reinforce with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ mor@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) , whereas the endo@@ genic cor@@ ti@@ sol increase by approximately 86 % for the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ ko@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of treatment the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oi@@ des ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or , such as Lov@@ ast@@ ine and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose thick@@ nesses can be heavily dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced elev@@ ations of plasma bars at the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ an increased of these H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to m@@ yo@@ path@@ ia , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ se , the combined application of these medicines is not recommended with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended a common monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ ze the mirror , since the plas@@ tic@@ concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased in simultaneous gift of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be applied together with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while in the current application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advisable . &quot;
data on the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ect@@ or@@ bit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plas@@ mas@@ h level of mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on is administered along with am@@ en@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium deficiency symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
because of the low reliability of historical comparisons currently no recommendation can be given such as the Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r@@ - dosage is to be adapted when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
&quot; at the current gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia , along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of anti @-@ thro@@ genic effects ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not fores@@ een , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful acceptance of the possible utility for the mother compared to the potential risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk l@@ actic rings , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were proven , however , it is not known whether Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is transferred to people into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
a reproduction study on a cre@@ denti@@ al rats has been administered from the intru@@ sion into the uter@@ ine until the end of down@@ time Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r showed during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight in the offspring .
the further development of the offspring including Fer@@ til@@ ity and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the im@@ memorial of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children aged 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with different other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment associated side effects were slightly up to moderate , occurred early and led to the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; many of these events are not clarified , whether in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another simultaneously to HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the listed side @-@ effects are made from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with protein signs , patients received 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
events ( degree 2 to 4 ) performed by the investig@@ ators than in connection with study medication and were performed by more than 1 % of patients as well as in the treatment of conducted laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) .
&quot; the anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy combination has been associated with an re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripher@@ al and fast sub @-@ fat tissues , under@@ mined and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissues , hyper@@ trop@@ hies of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ os fat . &quot;
&quot; among 113 anti@@ retro@@ fitted people , who were treated with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ dine / zi@@ dov@@ u@@ dine over a medium duration of 36 weeks , was only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ ecks ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 occurred at 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ N ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

&quot; cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose have been reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term waste of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , a inflammatory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ ist infections can be developed ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase were treated twice daily with low do@@ si@@ lled Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degrees 3 and 4 ) , which were used under all@@ ure of the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d@@ - and CP@@ K values , which in patients , the A@@ gener@@ ase combined with low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequent . &quot;

&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood @-@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % protein concentrations ( IC@@ 50 ) from Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is located in the range from 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm with acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm for chronic cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication at man is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ fit patients with the currently approved Fos@@ ro@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses were observed - as with other k@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ oo@@ ed treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ eas@@ ants - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .

&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns are subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current interpre@@ tations for the analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
on Phen@@ otyp@@ ic Res@@ istence based analyses of Clinical vali@@ dated Phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ tations systems can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for the assessment of the activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ r@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ otyp@@ ing @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies to distribute the diagnostic resistance tests have clin@@ ically developed @-@ phen@@ otype @-@ phen@@ otype @-@ off ( divi@@ des ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used for interpre@@ ting results of a res@@ istence .
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to am@@ oc@@ avi@@ r associ@@ ated genetic patterns creates a certain crus@@ ade against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but generally retained . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on the cross resistance between Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ agon@@ ists for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of five @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ in@@ treated ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ dent@@ avi@@ r / k@@ amp@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ rac@@ ers @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; preserving this activity seems to be dependent on the number and the type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insul@@ ates . &quot;
the early departure of a ver@@ aging therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that can affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , based on PI pre @-@ treated adults ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , so@@ C ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , so@@ C ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ shaped Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; , &quot; received . &quot;
&quot; a hundred thre@@ e@@ tri@@ ples ( s = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub @-@ embarrass@@ ment of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI @-@ group with regard to the time @-@ determined average change ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma @-@ load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks in a non @-@ sub @-@ threshold of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of un@@ bund@@ led ast@@ er@@ ase is based on two im@@ controlled studies with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was used for inser@@ tion and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of those with PI pre @-@ treated patients had given at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study carried out a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output . &quot;
&quot; 19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; in@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum Ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ max is reduced by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered along with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % discount of the au@@ c but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influenced the extent and the rate of the resistance . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ plug@@ ged penetration of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bund@@ ling Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ folded am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage percentage of free active component in dependence on the overall health @-@ level centr@@ ation in the Ste@@ ady state across the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore medicines to indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ ed or inhi@@ bited or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r exposure as for adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is made of the solution 14 % less bi@@ ver@@ able than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a mil@@ grams basis . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neglected , therefore , the effect of a kidney disorder is likely to be low on the Eli@@ min@@ ation of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
this treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r plas@@ mas@@ tic comparable to those that are made to healthy pro@@ ban@@ ces after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for can@@ v@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ atoms on man , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r , were sp@@ elled . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the creation of hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ o@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ ome has not yet been solved and the relevance of this observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; from the present appearance data on man , both in clinical trials and in the therapeutic use , there are little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro co@@ qu@@ ests , the bacterial re@@ verse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ ly@@ mph@@ oma testing to rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ation in human peri@@ ph@@ ate lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in the clinical daily routine by measuring , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; so far , clinical studies have not been observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies for toxicity in young animals , which were treated as at an age of 4 days , shown both in the check@@ ups and with the Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ treated animals , showed high mor@@ t@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; in a systemic Plas@@ ma@@ Ex@@ pos@@ ure , which lay significant among ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure among humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus circuits and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that point on a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the ampli@@ fying additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ks@@ ing ) are applied , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous application is to be carried out with caution in patients with fer@@ mentation or mild liver @-@ dysfunction with caution , in patients with severe liver functional disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ ality rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the substance evaluation . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cos@@ ity is involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; an elevated risk for a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ ts factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and the associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by a 82 % reduction in the au@@ c of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to lead to a resource development . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ max with 30 % humili@@ ated , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered in combination with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in combination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; intake recommended for simultaneous administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra can not be given , however , there is a narro@@ wer surveillance recommended as the efficacy and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both protein signs is low .
&quot; if these medicines will be applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made , as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of combination of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and k@@ ra@@ viol@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin coinci@@ ded with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ ers , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , g@@ odi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and tox@@ ins of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) , whereas the endo@@ genic cor@@ ti@@ sol increase by approximately 86 % for the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; at the current gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia , along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of anti @-@ thro@@ genic effects ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg of E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.@@ 0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease in the au@@ c and C@@ min by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied according to careful acceptance of the possible utility for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
a reproduction study on a cre@@ denti@@ al rats has been administered from the intru@@ sion into the uter@@ ine until the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r showed during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight in the offspring .
the im@@ memorial of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children aged 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with different other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary supportive policies to initiate . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood @-@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % protein concentrations ( IC@@ 50 ) from Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is located in the range from 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm with chronic cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ rac@@ ers @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; preserving this activity seems to be dependent on the number and the type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insul@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , the treatment optimisation of these data should be considered with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; in@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ folded am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage percentage of free active component in dependence on the overall health @-@ level centr@@ ation in the Ste@@ ady state across the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore medicines to indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ ed or inhi@@ bited or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neglected ; therefore , the effect of a kidney disorder is likely to be low on the Eli@@ min@@ ation of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for can@@ v@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ omes in doses , which were used to 2.@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the creation of the hep@@ at@@ ect@@ onic Aden@@ omas and kar@@ zin@@ ome has not yet been solved and the relevance of this observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; from the present appearance data on man , both clinical trials and therapeutic applications , however , little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;

&quot; studies for toxicity in young animals , which were treated as at an age of 4 days , shown both in the check@@ ups and with the Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ treated animals , showed high mor@@ t@@ ality . &quot;
these results let it conclude that in juven@@ ile the met@@ alli@@ zation passages are not yet fully mature so that am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r or other critical ingredients of formulation ( z ) .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to access is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ eas@@ ants ( PI ) for adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to installation has not been substanti@@ ated either with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r as a solution to one @-@ take is around 14 % less than a capsule ; therefore are A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ tion on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to stop taking ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; additionally , since no dose recommendations can be given for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to inhal@@ ing and low @-@ wearing Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination of these patients has to be avoided . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment for am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r is not necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to inclusion in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ cos@@ ity content , A@@ gener@@ ase solution to inclusion in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure , and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive inhibit@@ ation of the met@@ alli@@ zation of these medicines and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening effects such as cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ ality rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the substance evaluation . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be placed in duration when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cos@@ ity is involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; an elevated risk for a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug medium @-@ dependent factors such as a longer continual anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and the associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; on h@@ ub@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ agon@@ ists , reports of a increase of blood vessels including spontaneous pol@@ mat@@ ologists and her@@ b@@ thro@@ es . &quot;

&quot; the application cav@@ ity and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dara depend on the treating disease : • At maximum 16 weeks old . • In case of small bas@@ al@@ cell disease , the cream is six weeks old five times weekly , with four weeks of break between the treatment cycles , three times weekly . &quot;
the cream is stopped in front of the bed@@ time th@@ rot@@ ate on the affected skin surfaces so they have enough long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away .
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dara were compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dara has been tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients treated with full @-@ heating of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara was also examined on 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell disease in two studies when patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dara or the placebo were either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete cooling of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis .
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dara was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total breakdown rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated by placebo . • The results of the two studies to bas@@ al cell disease was given up to 80 % in patients with Al@@ dara treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or itch ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ants ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p at immun@@ o adults , if the size or the number of lesi@@ ons are limiting the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy , and other topical treatment options contra@@ indicated or less appropriate . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday , Thursday and Saturday ) to leave the bed and leave 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all visible F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts have disappeared or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
&quot; if any interruption in the above process should be raised , when intensive local inflamm@@ ations occur ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) or if a infection is observed in the treatment area . &quot;
&quot; if at the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the lesi@@ ons were only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose was left out , the patient sol@@ dering the cream once he / she notices it and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is available in a thin shift , and in the ger@@ ent , with F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts infected skin @-@ area until the cream is completely covered . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be a decrease in these patients between the benefits of using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their autoimmune disease . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be a decrease in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with potential organ@@ ig@@ ar@@ rests or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ line reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ ored hygiene has been conducted , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mos@@ is and a case with one of the circumc@@ ision leading rop@@ hies . &quot;
&quot; in an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , an increased risk for heavy local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 ) in rare cases were observed also under @-@ temper@@ ate application heavy local skin irritation , which made a treatment required and / or led to a temporary physical impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine , which required an emergency dec@@ aying and a treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous resources for the treatment of external F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in the genital area , so far there are no clinical experience before . &quot;
limited data indicate an increased rate of F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts with HIV @-@ positive patients ; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lesser effectiveness in this patient @-@ group with regard to the removal of the F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts however a lesser effectiveness .
&quot; the treatment of alkal@@ ine cells with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; local tre@@ aches are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions takes place generally during therapy or the reactions can be returned after the conclusion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary because of the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of local skin actions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed according to the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there is currently no data available on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , should consider adequate therapy forms with other suitable therapy forms . &quot;
&quot; in patients with relap@@ sing and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , there are no clinical experience before , therefore the application is not recommended during pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial indicate that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower likelihood of the contact to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of c@@ anned ker@@ at@@ ins on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or at the lip area within the lip of the lip . &quot;
&quot; there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of c@@ anned ker@@ at@@ ants to anatom@@ ical areas outside of the face , and the scal@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the data available via the ac@@ ron@@ ic ker@@ at@@ mos@@ is on the sub@@ arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot;
local housing actions often occur but these reactions usually take in the course of therapy to intensity or go after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if the local skin reactions can cause great discomfort of the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for several days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - lesi@@ ons reported a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immun@@ o@@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive treatment ( see 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; from animal studies do not assume direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , the embryonic / feder@@ tale development , the kidn@@ apping or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after unilater@@ ally top@@ ographic application quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um mirror ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation can be given for use during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most commonly used and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related to the studies with three consecutive treatment were local reactions at the place of treating F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
among the most commonly reported and as probable or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related to the side @-@ side effects include complaints at the App@@ lications of 28.@@ 1 % .
the alkal@@ ine @-@ cream treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side @-@ effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common , as probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the context of the side @-@ effect in these studies were a reaction to the App@@ lications ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) . &quot;
&quot; the side @-@ effects that were specified by 25@@ 2 into plac@@ ebo@@ arding clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with acute candle , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; this according to the inspection assessment of clinical signs shows that it came into a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three three @-@ controlled clinical trials , including Er@@ y@@ qu@@ im@@ od ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ denti@@ ation / wast@@ ing ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ MI ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; this according to the inspection assessment of clinical signs shows that in these studies with five @-@ time weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , it came very often to heavy yields ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and heavy sc@@ rape and c@@ ru@@ st@@ ung ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies for the investigation of the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of the ak@@ ian ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was established with a frequency of 0.@@ 4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the fores@@ ee@@ ably unique recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could cause nausea , vom@@ iting , headaches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the sound@@ ly difficult side effect , that occurred after several or@@ ical doses of &gt; 200 mg existed in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , who norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic examination , according to the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od increased systemic concentrations of the alpha@@ interference and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine were demonstrated . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be demonstrated that the effectiveness in relation to a complete cooling of the F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts at an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is clearly defined over 16 weeks of a placebo @-@ treatment .
at 60 % of the total 119 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy patients healed the F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts completely from ; this was at 20 % of the 105 with placebo therapy in the case ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete cooling could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated to male patients compared to 5 % from 16@@ 1 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ recurring application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind trials , a placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ our were hist@@ ological confirmed individual primary super@@ natural cell disease with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open @-@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of present data show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically healed and this also stayed for 48 months .
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in three times of weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind trials , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;

&quot; the approved indications in@@ ali@@ enable F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and Super@@ vis@@ cer@@ atric patients usually do not depend on and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dara cream has been studied in four random@@ ized , double @-@ blind studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not shown in these studies in these studies ( 3@@ x / week for a period of about 16 weeks b@@ z@@ w ) .
a minimal systemic shot of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with acoustic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed at the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug con@@ centr@@ ations in the Ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and contributed 0,@@ 1 , 0,@@ 2 and 1,6 n@@ g / ml when applying in the face ( 12,@@ 5 mg , 1 bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bag ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bag ) . &quot;
&quot; the calculated half @-@ time period lay around 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ hour application , according to the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a former study ; this indicates a prolonged ret@@ en@@ tion of the drug by means of the skin . &quot;
the data for the systemic exposure showed that the Res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application of patients aged 6 to 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with acoustic ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ imposed Bas@@ al@@ cell .
&quot; in a four months study to the paint toxicity in the rat resulted from 0,5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg to significant imp@@ acted body weight and increased lac@@ z @-@ weight ; one also four months long run study to the paint application revealed in the mouse no similar effects . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice at der@@ m@@ aler administration three days a week induc@@ ed no tum@@ ors on the application place .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption of human skin and not mut@@ agen@@ ic is a risk to humans due to the systemic exposure to be very low . &quot;
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice that was treated with the real @-@ free cream earlier and in greater number than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

&quot; in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was examined , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( by investig@@ ating its effect with regard to reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and regarding the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; with children under five years of sen@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine was about 60 % , and half of the treated children pointed out a normal liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , nausea , abdom@@ inal pain , pain pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion place . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen @-@ satur@@ ation ( a measurement of pulmon@@ ary function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ um ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and shaft . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may be extremely sensitive to patients , who may react strongly ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) . &quot;
&quot; the European Drugs Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will be available every year all new information that may be known , check and update this summary . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients , the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to observe the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies . &quot;
June 2003 the European Commission shared the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. auth@@ ored the approval of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology using CH@@ O @-@ mammals ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ ght of Chinese Ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for long @-@ term en@@ rol@@ ment therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ y@@ sac@@ chari@@ socket I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the condition ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can when the patient contributes to it all 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients cannot be recommended . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure have not been identified ; and for these patients cannot be recommended as a reference scheme .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , patients may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any related side effect , which occurs during the in@@ fusion or by the end of in@@ fusion ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , particularly these patients should continue to be eng@@ low , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be made available only in an appropriate clinical setting , at the reg@@ im@@ itation facilities for medical emergen@@ cies immediately . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study , almost all patients are Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion reaction , must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , has to be cautious due to the theoretical risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after a break of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes prior to the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or Anti@@ py@@ re@@ ics ) to minimize the potential in@@ fusion of reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate @-@ severe in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ am@@ in@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be wei@@ ghed and / or reducing the in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are associated with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ am@@ in@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are used ( anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ am@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not simultaneously be applied with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
&quot; experimental studies do not let direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic development / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms not to be silent . &quot;
the effects of clinical trials have been en@@ acted mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which at 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study were observed under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
&quot; unwanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the period of 5 years or older at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper air@@ ways and lungs in the pre@@ history , in addition , heavy reactions occurred , including bronze beats , respiratory and facial wrinkles ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ er@@ desired drug @-@ effects in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with largely he@@ avier and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , reports are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; during the period of 3 months after the start of the treatment , it was conducted within 3 months after the start of treatment to a ser@@ o @-@ conversion ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days of patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients have been detected by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ lan@@ terns ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say demonstr@@ able antibodies , among them 3 patients where there was never been to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ versions . &quot;
patients with lack of low level of anti@@ body rejuven@@ ates a robust reduction in the G@@ AG sp@@ ying at the har@@ n while in patients with high anti@@ body ti@@ fications a variable reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally to minor neutral effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vit@@ ro which seemed to interfere with the clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of G@@ AG in har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of unwanted drug actions although the occurrence of unwanted drug interactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for the en@@ rol@@ ment therapy is in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of other accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzymes .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly taken out of circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ates recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind phase @-@ 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the entire disease spectrum was reported , the majority of patients was referred to by the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient referred to the serious phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute en@@ closure .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients compared to the placebo group , an improvement in pulmon@@ ary function and the capacity to be shown in the following table . &quot;
&quot; with an open extension study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects showed up to 20@@ 8 weeks in der@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as emerges from the following table . &quot;
the acceptance of the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period of clin@@ ically and the absolute lung capacity increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a hep@@ at@@ ant treatment achieved in front of the treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant waste from the G@@ AG mir@@ rors in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Cre@@ at@@ ine ) has been constant , which remained constant up to the degree of study . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the hetero@@ genic disease , in line with the patient , which has been taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes overall for five efficacy approval ( to be expected percentage of 26 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase @-@ 2 study , which was primarily investig@@ ating the safety and pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the heavy shopping form and 4 with the middle @-@ cycle form ) . &quot;
&quot; in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GA@@ G@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in Week 22 , in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) observed after the Z @-@ score for this age group , showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe reliance on a limited period of course , was limited , or no progress made in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , investigations into phar@@ ma @-@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ do@@ automation schem@@ ata at the G@@ AG mir@@ rors in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute en@@ closures were carried out . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the automation scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , a representative option ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two do@@ ings are equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information , which are available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile among patients aged 5 years was similar to that in older and less strongly affected patients .

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( a different drug against cancer ) in patients who still cannot be removed from chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) of cancer has already been extended to other parts of the body , or spreads slightly to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non@@ cl@@ ums@@ y &quot; lung cancer , which does not take the record epitheli@@ um cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is treated in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy than any therapy . &quot;
&quot; to decrease side effects , patients should take in the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fol@@ ate ( a vitamin ) and injections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition to an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent hydr@@ ation deficiency ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood picture changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be reduced , or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ produces slo@@ ws down the formation of DNA and RNA , and prevents the cells to divide . &quot;
&quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ produces in its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer lasting effect in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study to 4@@ 56 patients who previously had no chemotherapy against their condition . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived at an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
patients who previously received an chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in both studies , however , patients , in which the cancer did not attack the record epitheli@@ um cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer lifetime than with the comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission shared by the company El@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. gave permission to transport A@@ lim@@ ta to the whole of the European Union . &quot;
each flow bottle must be implemented with 4.@@ 2 ml of 0.@@ 9 % less sodium solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to solve a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - sis is taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium in@@ denti@@ tion solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carto@@ graphy ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is displayed for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ cl@@ ums@@ y bron@@ chi@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of the height ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma according to previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; to reduce the frequency and severity of Hau@@ tre@@ actions , on the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ ster@@ oid are given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ plen@@ xed must be taken at least 5 doses , and the intake must be continued during the entire treatment duration and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate . &quot;
patients must also receive an in@@ tra @-@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third payment cycle .
&quot; in case of patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ funds , each gift should be created full of blood @-@ image , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ ro@@ genic en@@ sus . &quot;
the alkal@@ ine ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame Trans@@ am@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in Trans@@ am@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper border value . &quot;
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a tin examination must take place under fame or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the fores@@ ee@@ able therapeutic cycles .
&quot; after the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute common G@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood .
&quot; should patients not develop @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological Tox@@ ic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient value the value before treatment . &quot;
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ tically Tox@@ ic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ mat@@ ological toxicity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort on the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 Jah@@ - or in comparison to patients aged 65 years an increased risk risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data on in@@ conceivable and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment necessary for all patients recommended dosage adjustment . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restric@@ ts from &gt; to the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bun@@ ili@@ br@@ - border value and / or Trans@@ am@@ in@@ as@@ en@@ values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( at the presence of liver metastatic ) is not specifically studied in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with regard to the Kno@@ wing mark@@ er , and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ funds may not be administered to patients before their absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ onic population has again reached a value of 1,@@ 500 cells / mm ³ and the thy@@ roid &apos;s number has reached a value of 1,@@ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; a dose reduction for other cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ics , Th@@ ro@@ genic number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity , as observed in the preceding treatment cycles - the ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; therefore , all patients must be dependent with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ - l@@ actic measure to apply reduction related toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - T@@ ens 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;

&quot; many patients in which these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or Diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid fluid - accumulation in trans@@ cellular space is a dra@@ in@@ age of the result in front of the sof@@ tened treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal , and zer@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated compounds ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of irreversible skull is made of reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ produces , men should be cau@@ tioned off before the treatment of treatment , consult with regard to blocking systems . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses can lead non @-@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ei@@ c acid ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to lead to a decreased P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ vit@@ re@@ ation with the result of a multip@@ lier of side @-@ effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advisable when patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or Ac@@ a- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ei@@ c acid can be applied in high dosage . &quot;

&quot; since no data is available with regard to the interim potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ time such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the sc@@ inn@@ ability status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ arities and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International standard rati@@ o ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed with pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ vil@@ s an@@ tim@@ el@@ ites are expected in an application in pregnancy heavy birth defects . &quot;

the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om was shown in the application of the Lun@@ i gen@@ it@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the all@@ ot@@ th@@ tin @-@ arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .

it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body @-@ mass@@ dex ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter combined with a low @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
patients who occupy All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their physician or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can not construct some fats in the food , making about a quarter of the fats resulted from the intest@@ ines into the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was overweight with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 had patients who received an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo . &quot;
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for the patient &apos;s weight loss .
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are home@@ stain@@ s on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ ds , fl@@ yers , o@@ ves , o@@ cular secre@@ tion , Flat@@ ul@@ enz ( Win@@ ds ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be applied in patients that are treated with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for prevention of transplan@@ tation by transplan@@ tation ) or drugs like war@@ far@@ in to prevent cl@@ ots .
&quot; in addition , it must not be applied in patients who suffer from a long term Mal@@ absor@@ bing syndrome ( with which not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or at chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and with pregnant mothers . &quot;
July 2007 the European Commission signed the G@@ lax@@ o Group limited approval for the in@@ securities of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union .
&quot; alli made to weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ an , fatty food . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied to children and young people under 18 , since not enough data on efficacy and safety exist . &quot;
&quot; however , since Or@@ list@@ at is only re@@ absorbed only by older and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adaptation of the dosage is necessary . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components • simultaneous treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.5 ) • Chron@@ icles • pregnancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • In@@ simultaneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
&quot; the probability of out@@ ward gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase , if alli is taken along with a fat @-@ rich single @-@ meal or fat @-@ rich diet . &quot;
&quot; since the weight reduction can be accompanied by diabetes with an improved metabolic control , patients should consult a drug against diabetes , before starting a therapy with alli a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adapted . &quot;
patients who take care and medicines for hypertension or an increased cholesterol level should ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist asking whether the dosage of these medicines must be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to take additional fluctu@@ ating measures , in order to avoid the potential contrac@@ eption in the case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study to interactions between medicines and in several instances with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in has been observed a lowering of the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma .
&quot; in the use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with Or@@ list@@ at could be influenced by the Quick @-@ values ( internationally normal , rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with Or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of the vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta Car@@ ot@@ ins in the standard . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be recommended before bed@@ time a supplement to the mul@@ tiv@@ itamin supplement to ensure a sufficient vitam@@ in@@ takes ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a mal@@ mal@@ osis Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of volunteers , which at the same time received a low decrease in Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embryonic development / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side @-@ effects of Or@@ ders are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of accumulated fat is prevented . &quot;
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects were obtained from clinical trials with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( frequency on the basis of available data is not invaluable ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of which were known as side @-@ effects , which were established after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at , is not known because these events voluntarily were reported by a population of a certain degree of magnitude . &quot;
15 . it is plau@@ sible that treatment with alli can lead to def@@ enses with regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects .
&quot; single @-@ ins of 800 mg Or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ domain of up to 400 mg three times daily have been administered for a period of 15 days at norm@@ al@@ ge@@ al and overweight people , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of the cases reported on the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ dose , either no side @-@ effects or similar side effects were reported at the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on research on humans and animals can be traced by a fast re@@ formation , systemic effects that are attributed to the li@@ gible properties of or@@ bit@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect takes place in the lum@@ ens of the ma@@ gen and the upper fertilizer @-@ intest@@ ines through kov@@ al@@ ent bon@@ ding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of ga@@ str@@ al and pan@@ acea Li@@ pas@@ en .
&quot; derived from clinical trials were derived that 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , absorption of about 25 % of food intake . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled studies on adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 take over the effectiveness of 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ical , fatty food . &quot;
the primary parameter to change the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as percentage of those studies that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) .
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the overall cholester@@ in was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.@@ 4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.@@ 8 % ( output value 5 : 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3,@@ 8 % ( cur@@ value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of non @-@ metabolic organs were 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg Or@@ list@@ at not measurable ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , with therapeu@@ tical dos@@ ages , not yet met@@ abo@@ li@@ ath in plasma was only spor@@ adic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0,@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a sorrow . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy , which are strong sol@@ vers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as for chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ isters , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as to the effects in this age group do not exist enough information .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient of chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , prevents the recept@@ ors in the gut . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chemotherapy were given , which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are , 59 % of the patients treated with al@@ xi ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron treated patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are , 81 % of the patients were treated with al@@ xi ( 15@@ 3 from 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of the patients with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;

&quot; March 2005 , the European Commission distributed Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . approval for the in@@ securities of Alo@@ xi across the European Union . &quot;
al@@ xi is indi@@ gn@@ ant : for the prevention of acute symptoms and vom@@ iting with severely em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting with moderate chemotherapy due to cancer infection .
the effectiveness of al@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting which is induc@@ ed by a severely em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding one before the chemotherapy given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ otic tron can extend the dick@@ head age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ scher Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ ak@@ in I@@ le@@ us after the injection . &quot;
&quot; however , like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 @-@ antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable in the current gift of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to be an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with another chem@@ ist administration , al@@ xi is supposed to be used either in the days after chemotherapy neither for prevention nor for the treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;

&quot; experience of the application of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron in human pregn@@ ancies are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ otic tron is not to be used in pregnant women , unless it is necessary by the prescri@@ bing doctor . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe side effects ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi related to headaches ( 9 % ) and shelter ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity and reactions to the date of fulfillment ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;

&quot; there have been no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy in a Alo@@ xi@@ - Over@@ do@@ tization . &quot;

&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients , which received a severely em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ ann@@ ine , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ se@@ ba@@ z@@ ine , with patients compared to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron received , which were given intraven@@ ously by day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
the results of the studies with moder@@ ated chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; clinical trials for indications of chemotherapy induc@@ ed nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron has the ability to block the en@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and pol@@ arized channels and extend the duration of action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy promot@@ ers conducted study was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. Chr. in single @-@ ins of 0,@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous , Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous elimination of the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations follows a slow Eli@@ min@@ ation from the body with an average termin@@ ative half @-@ time of about 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plastic concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally related to the entire Dos@@ age of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ / kg with gestures and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average sized average sized ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ otic tron Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , that at once daily intraven@@ ous gift of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron was similar to 3 consecutive days reaching the overall tex@@ tual administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher according to the application of 0.@@ 75 mg higher . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated across the kidneys , and approximately another 50 % are transformed into two primary met@@ alli@@ zation , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for met@@ alli@@ zation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ ja C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 und C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 has participated in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ min@@ ation After a intraven@@ ous individual dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ otic tron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ otic tron as un@@ altered active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
after a unique intraven@@ ous bolt @-@ injection at gestures was the overall body @-@ condition 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; although in patients with severe liver disorder , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation @-@ value and the average systemic exposure is increased with Pal@@ on@@ otic tron , a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of pre@@ clinical trials have advised that Pal@@ on@@ otic tron can only block in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ en@@ can@@ als , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and pol@@ pol@@ arization and extend the potential for action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron ( every dose was given in approximately the 30@@ s of the therapeutic exposure of men ) , which were given daily over two years , led to a multip@@ ly incidence of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine Ne@@ oplas@@ mes ( in thy@@ roid , pituitary , pancre@@ atic cord ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not on mice . &quot;
&quot; underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high doses used and since Alo@@ xi is destined for single application the relevance of these results are low . &quot;
the approval of this approval must be sent to the in@@ securities issued by the European Commission about the plans for the in@@ verse of the drug by means of this decision .

&quot; June 2006 , the Committee on Human@@ Economics ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report on the drug provided for the treatment of hepatitis C to the treatment of hepatitis C by means of al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injections . &quot;
&quot; this means Al@@ ph@@ e@@ eon a biological drugs called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same practitioner of effective effective components , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference pharmac@@ o@@ cide &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ prolonged the ) hepatitis C ( one through a viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination the liver tissue damages occur , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme alan@@ in- Amin@@ otran@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increased in the blood of the liver . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the substance .
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data , which occupy the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active material , composition and purity of the drug , effect , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
in the study of patients with hepatitis C the effectiveness of Al@@ ph@@ eon has been compared with the effectiveness of the reference rate by means of 4@@ 55 patients .
&quot; in the study was measured , as many patients spoke after 12 of total 48 treatments as well as 6 months after hiring the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; in addition , concerns were expressed in detail that data on the stability of the substance and the pharmaceutical drugs do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which spoke to treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon and ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after setting up the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon fl@@ amm@@ ates the disease in more patients again than with the reference rate , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test was conducted in the study on how far the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ body - special proteins - against the drug ) , not adequately vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it may be applied to the treatment of Im@@ peti@@ go ( one with cruci@@ fied skin infection ) and small in@@ ated in@@ filtr@@ ations ( cr@@ acking or ker@@ f@@ aded ) , sh@@ ado@@ wing and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go is not supposed to be used to treat infections that have demonstr@@ ably or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant pile bi@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against this type of infections could not work .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied for patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the surface to be treated to be treated as 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient speaks to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial strains used in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was carried out in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was shortened after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ unden , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar contact rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in Hau@@ tw@@ unden , they spoke about 90 % of the patients of both groups to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( semi @-@ filled cav@@ ity in the body tissues ) or of infections that have been proven or presumably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which has been observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the location .
&quot; the committee on human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go over the short @-@ time treatment of the following superficial skin infections across the risks are over@@ l@@ apped : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • in@@ stig@@ ated little Laz@@ er@@ ations , sh@@ ado@@ wing or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
may 2007 the European Commission shared the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd. a permit for the in@@ securities of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
&quot; patients , which show no improvement within two or three days , should be examined once more and an alternative therapy can be considered ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of raising awareness or serious local irritation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment has been abandoned , the sal@@ be carefully and an adequate alternative treatment of the infection will be started . &quot;
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to treat infections , where MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gens or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in clinical studies in secondary studies was the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ icillin resistant to Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , in@@ sufficiently . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected position after a 2 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plastic concentrations , which were reached in humans after topical application on a reduced skin or infected superficial wounds , is a clin@@ ically relevant im@@ itation in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous gift of 2 @-@ times 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the average ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Au@@ c ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on a reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , Dos@@ age adap@@ tations are not deemed necessary when topical re@@ ap@@ ine is applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a Re@@ productive intake after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the feder@@ tale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine should only be applied during pregnancy , if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin the gift of a systemic antibiotic is prefer@@ able . &quot;
&quot; when deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / finished , or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to continue , is between the benefit of breastfeeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was applied , was the most often reported side @-@ effect irritation at the administration of the administration , which amount to approximately 1 % of the patients . &quot;
actu@@ alizing re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin which is isolated by Fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a certain den@@ ess of the 50@@ s under@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms which differs from the binary and other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ woven substances .
data indicate that the bin@@ ational protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ bin@@ ational location and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ e@@ centre .
&quot; by connecting to this bin@@ ational point , P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhibit@@ ing the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ line , blocking some P @-@ bin@@ ational interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should , on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance to the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , at least some infection forms , a consultation should be pursued by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to Meth@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in the case of failure to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( like PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study involving healthy adults was given 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine daily with oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary wounds , individual plasma were obtained . &quot;
the sampling took place on the days 3 or 4 in adult patients in front of the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .

&quot; met@@ alli@@ ism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ en , primarily was conve@@ yed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;

&quot; there were neither male nor female R@@ atten signs of reduced fertility at oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby one up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved as the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 shiel@@ ded skin : &quot;

Ambi@@ rix will be used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases which concern the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not yet im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied under one of two doses to existing vacc@@ inations and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is ensured that the existing vacc@@ inations can be led out of two doses . &quot;
if a refres@@ her dose is requested against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another Hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine will be given . &quot;
&quot; vaccines have a effect by bringing to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , &quot; as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has preserved the vaccine , the immune system recognises the viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as that since 1996 approved Twin@@ rix adults and which since 1997 approved human vaccine Twin@@ rix children .
&quot; the three vaccines are used for protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix Children are administered within one of three doses of existing vacc@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult identical ingredients were used , some of the data that uses the application of Twin@@ rix adults as well as evidence of the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the portion of the vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection of antibodies .
&quot; in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two injections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection of antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix at a six @-@ month period between the injections was similar .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain in the injection , redness , mat@@ uring ( fatigue ) , as well as stimul@@ i . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be hyper@@ sensitive to patients who may not be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 the European Commission submitted to the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als S.@@ a. a permit for the in@@ securities of Ambi@@ rix across the whole
&quot; the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administered by the election and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her is desired for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al vaccines or with a combination of fuel . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis @-@ virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis @-@ A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ body ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ body ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ body ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ body ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ virus is the same size as after vaccination with the respective Mongo@@ lian vaccines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ ologically competent persons are addressed to have a refres@@ hes as protection , since they are also protected with un@@ det@@ ectable antibodies as it may not be protected by the immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all inj@@ ectors , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine there are appropriate ways of medical treatment and supervision always available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the stand@@ ardis@@ ation scheme is recommended , using the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; for her@@ edi@@ tary patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , under circumstances no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti@@ body is achieved so that in these cases the gift of other vacc@@ inations can be required . &quot;
&quot; as an in@@ trac@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to an optimal impact of success , these injections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , with thy@@ roid or blood cl@@ utter disorders can be in@@ compar@@ atively sub@@ cut@@ aneous , since it can come in these cases of in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding . &quot;
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , t@@ apping pol@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ us by enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps @-@ vaccine is sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in patients under immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in patients with immun@@ os@@ ek@@ y needs to be assumed , that perhaps no adequate immune response is achieved . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study that has been through 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headaches and fever comparable to the frequency which has been observed during the previous Thi@@ ckness and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccine . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vaccines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with which of the 3 @-@ doses ratio . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ uring on one calculation base per vaccination Ambi@@ rix , but not on one basis basis per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the Gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the promot@@ ers compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % of the promot@@ ers following the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses .
&quot; after the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects given to Ambi@@ rix had administered about pain , compared to 6@@ 3,@@ 8 % at the pros that have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ age compound . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat was comparable ( i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the promot@@ ers who received Ambi@@ rix , compared to 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % in the pros used in the 3 @-@ doses ratio ) . &quot;
the frequency of reduced pain and matri@@ ces was small and comparable to those that have been observed after filing the match with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year &apos;s vacc@@ inations , the occurrence of local interactions and general transactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group , comparable to that , which was observed with the 3 @-@ cans combination with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ B surface finishes with 360 ELISA units . &quot;
&quot; however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix , has been a common occurrence of pain ( at the inj@@ ure ) per dose , not per rehearsal , reported . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of vacc@@ inations , which reported over heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ cans vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ cans vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ B@@ - surface finishes , was not different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials that were conducted at vacc@@ lingen at the age of 1 to 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were given a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - until 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses received Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combination with three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the 2@@ 89 persons , their immun@@ isation rates were valuable , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dosage , it was significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were obtained in a clinical comparison study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the end of the full vaccine ( i.e. in the month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations were either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses of a combination with 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
persons who were at the time of pri@@ di@@ mm@@ ation between 12 and 15 years old could be demonstrated by the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies over at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months of vaccination scheme .
&quot; the immune response @-@ reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that , which was established after vaccination by 3 doses with a combination of 360 ELISA units , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ activated hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical study at 12@@ - up to 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be demonstrated that the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months of vaccine is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months of vaccination scheme .

&quot; the hepatitis @-@ A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in water @-@ poll@@ uted waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that may need a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix cannot be fully protected from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( though you / your child are infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ) ( though you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or sick ) a vaccine may not prevent a vaccine .
&quot; protection against other infections that are causing the liver damage or symptoms , which are similar to those after a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be conve@@ yed . &quot;
• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself through it@@ ching skin strikes , respir@@ ation or swelling of the face or tongue . • If with you / your child has performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you have a serious infection with fever in your child . &quot;
• If you want to quickly have protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the date scheduled for the second vacc@@ inations ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vacc@@ inations ( 360 ELISA units of a formal hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combined hepatitis B surface area ) .
&quot; the second vacc@@ inations of this vaccine with reduced salary of effective components , usually administered a month after the first dose and may give you / your child a vaccine protection against end of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from individuals who suffer from severe blood pressure , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your / its body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child will undergo a here@@ to . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vaccination can not be sufficient , so a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 strings to your doctor , if you / your child can take other medicines , or if you have given your child to have been vacc@@ inated , or if you have administered or Imm@@ ung@@ o@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or has been planned in the near future . &quot;
but it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as possible as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually Ambi@@ rix pregnant or nursing women will not be administered , except it is urgent that it will be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; accommodation very common ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ed cans ) : • pain , or discomfort on the inser@@ tion place or redness • Mat@@ ter • Rei@@ z@@ ability • headaches • loss of appetite &quot;
&quot; pl@@ ast@@ ers often ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ed cans ) : • swelling at the inj@@ ector • fever ( over 38 ° C ) , • Ben@@ id@@ ness • gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data , which have become known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the in@@ securities , the CH@@ MP opinion remains positive for Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; however , Ambi@@ rix had only limited traffic in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data is limited to this medicine due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary encephal@@ opathy ( brain damage caused by high am@@ mon@@ am@@ moni@@ tions ) in the pre @-@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ aps - split by several single @-@ ins to meals - swal@@ lowed up under the food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ also ( by the abdom@@ inal ceiling in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose @-@ like ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps did not compare with any other treatment or placebo ( a hypo@@ cr@@ medicine , i.e. without drugs ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps may also cause loss of appetite , an abnormal aci@@ dity in blood , depression , stimul@@ ability , headaches , lack of taste , sickness , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , in@@ convenient body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the committee on human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disrup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle is effectively prevented from high mon@@ am@@ mon@@ ium values .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps has been approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; given due to the r@@ arity of the condition at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the use is inde@@ xed to all patients , in which a complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ ine deficiency has already manifested in the re@@ born age ( within the first 28 Leb@@ enst@@ age ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late mani@@ fixed form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective , which is manifested after the first lifetime ) then there is an indication for the use if in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ onic encephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with lo@@ fty distur@@ ban@@ ces is AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose will be calculated individually , taking into account the protein intolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient . &quot;
&quot; according to recent clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ fixed lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ atem@@ ia or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ ves , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with an arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ ase deficiency need to receive arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered patients with lo@@ op@@ ium as a risk to the emergence of Ö@@ sop@@ hag@@ us@@ ul@@ a if the tablets are not immediately taken into the stomach .
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be applied with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium and wast@@ ing clinical trials only with caution . &quot;
&quot; since met@@ alli@@ zation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at is carried out by the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; with sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slo@@ wing of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and a increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
they also found a delayed irritation of cerebral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning neur@@ ons in the brain and thereby a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is left out in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the lac@@ tation period is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS stood at 56 % of patients at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old par@@ anor@@ mal patient , who developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy , compound hypo@@ cris@@ y , P@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ ia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose came with a 5 month old small child with an accidentally single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate interfer@@ ing with intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose of neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active connection that is conve@@ yed by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine by phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ om@@ etric is seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea compared ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be accepted that for each gram there are sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
&quot; it is important that the diagnosis is provided at an early stage , and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival chances and clinical results . &quot;
&quot; the prognosis of the early man@@ ure shape of the condition with the appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn child was almost always inf@@ ant , and the disease itself led to death with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ ck@@ oning free an@@ alo@@ ga within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; by her@@ al@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative routes of nit@@ rogen waste ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , sodium and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ate acid ) , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new born at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first CV ) of diagnosed diseases to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients , whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and the survival rates were 100 % , but even with these patients the survival rates was 100 % , but even with these patients it was time with many other intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a bel@@ low @-@ mani@@ ac form of the condition ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ots form of or@@ ni@@ thin@@ k@@ scar@@ tin@@ opathy ) , who were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ olith@@ ic strip and subsequently permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ru@@ ined diet , was the survival rate 98 % . &quot;
existing neurological deficits are also hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients may appear a further deterioration of the neurological state .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in liver and Ni@@ ere enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine conve@@ y@@ glut@@ amine with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ alli@@ zation in plasma and urine were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ ber and repeti@@ tive gifts of or@@ ical doses from up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ alli@@ zation was also examined in cancer patients for intraven@@ ous form of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an or@@ bit@@ al dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form were determined 15 minutes after in@@ ges@@ tion measurement of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary disorders or hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ om@@ opath@@ ies , after varying doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning a phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma is shown . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single cases ) , the moderate phen@@ yl@@ ation con@@ centric in the third day was five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ed within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the consistent product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine on the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us @-@ testing , sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans treated rats has no cl@@ ast@@ o@@ genic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either by oral ( infants and children that have not yet swal@@ low tablets , or patients with lo@@ op@@ ies ) or a nose @-@ stom@@ a . &quot;
&quot; according to recent clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ prot@@ eine in plasma should be held within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ fixed lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ atem@@ ia or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ ves , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
if rat feder@@ ate was exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) from the birth of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ) it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain .
&quot; a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old par@@ anor@@ mal patient , who developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy , compound hypo@@ cris@@ y , P@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ ia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ om@@ etric is seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea compared ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess weight .
&quot; on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary Cycle can be accepted that for each gram &quot; &quot; phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen are produced . &quot;
&quot; existing neurological deficits are also hardly rever@@ sible in treatment , and in some patients may appear a further deterioration of the neurological state . &quot;
after an or@@ bit@@ al dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were determined 15 minutes after in@@ ges@@ tion measurement of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
this procedure contains the small measuring spo@@ on 0.@@ 95 g the mean measuring spo@@ on 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; if a patient must receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they accum@@ ulate the thick@@ ened waste products that are accum@@ ul@@ ating to the consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you are conducted laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you may take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can affect the results of specific laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; in ing@@ esting AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drug . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine could move into the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases were also confusion , head@@ ache , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , indul@@ gence of hearing , memory distur@@ ban@@ ces and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions . &quot;
&quot; when you find one of these symptoms , you can immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency intake of your hospital for initiation of appropriate treatment . &quot;
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS take the appropriate dose as soon as possible using the next meal .
&quot; changes of blood image ( red blood cell , white blood cells , thy@@ roid ) , dimin@@ ish appetite , headaches , pain , vom@@ iting , im@@ pleasant skin @-@ smell , rash , ren@@ al dys@@ functions , weight gain and anom@@ ale laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you have considerably imp@@ airs or you notice side effects which are not stated in this manual information .
you may no longer use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS to the exp@@ ir@@ ation date and the appearance after &quot; the exp@@ ir@@ ation date . &quot;
&quot; how AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and content of the AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of white color and oval shape , and they are equipped with the &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If you are conducted laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you may take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can affect the results of specific laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; in ing@@ esting AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drug . &quot;
&quot; you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed to the same individual d@@ osen oral ( hose , which runs through the abdom@@ inal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose ( hose , which is led through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; 31 If you see from the container a ch@@ illed Mess@@ l@@ spo@@ on Gran@@ ules . • St@@ range a straight edge , such as a measuring spo@@ on over the edge of the measurement opening , to remove excess fat . • The suggested quantity of measuring spo@@ on of gran@@ ules from the container . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood sugar to the heart ) , for example , by inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - H@@ ess@@ ation &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ gram for electro@@ cardi@@ o@@ gram or E@@ KG ) . &quot;
&quot; if An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the prevention of blood cl@@ ots in patients , which goes to a PCI , a higher dose will be administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox during a certain gift , or in combination with a gly@@ ph@@ eine @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with yeast treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( other anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during PCI the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tubes that remains in the arter@@ ial ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( death cases , heart failure or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year altogether as effectively as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who subjected to PCI , angi@@ ox was just as effective in terms of the indicators , except for serious bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than yeast . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be applied in patients , which may possibly be hyper@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other Hir@@ u@@ dine or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it must not be applied in patients who recently had a blood pressure , as well as with people with heavy high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the committee on human resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a decent replacement for He@@ par@@ in is .
September 2004 the European Commission shared the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd took approval for the in@@ securities of An@@ gi@@ ox across the European Union .
the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ k syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non@@ - ST @-@ mid@@ line ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency room or when an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of angi@@ o@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is conducted in another episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the operation to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h will be increased . &quot;
after the PCI can be resum@@ ed the reduced in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg shall be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ o@@ ox among patients with a PCI consists of a initi@@ ous intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of directly subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the operation .
the safety and effectiveness of a single Bol@@ us gift of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; if this value is shortened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) on a 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed before the application and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis will quickly be given intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value more than 225 seconds , another surveillance is no longer required , provided that 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value lies under 225 seconds , the ACT value lies under 225 seconds , is a second bolt dose of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg to ad@@ minister and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) which resulted in approval was included the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment , on average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also di@@ aly@@ sis patients is contra@@ indicated ( see below section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be started 30 minutes after the conclusion of the intraven@@ ous form of un@@ questionable hegemon@@ y or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of pre @-@ molecular hegemon@@ y .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other constitu@@ tions or against bra@@ u@@ dine • active blood pressure or higher blood risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ al immune system and / or irreversible an@@ im@@ etry . • heavy kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully administered during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if in PCI patients occur under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine most of the bleeding in arter@@ ial points , can undergo from patients who occur in a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ als ( PCI ) during treatment in principle everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are treated War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , should be considered a supervision of IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International norm@@ ality rati@@ o ) in order to ensure that the value after lowering of the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ din again achieved this before the treatment of an existing level . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ et@@ in , War@@ mb@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tika or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the risk of blood . &quot;
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with thy@@ roid aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ atic parameters in any case regularly control .

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ m@@ binary pump , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic centre and the anim@@ on@@ en@@ bin@@ der region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ h is tied in the liquid phase or on Ger@@ inn@@ sel . &quot;
&quot; the bon@@ ding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with it the effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is turned on the one hand the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thus generates the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generated . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is applied to the treatment of adults , young people and children from six years with diabetes , which need a treatment with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is administered more sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdom@@ inal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm , or is administered as continuous in@@ fusion with a ins@@ ulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to the regulation of glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or process ins@@ ulin is not effective .
&quot; ins@@ ulin @-@ is@@ in is very slightly different from Human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it affects faster and a shorter period of time than a short @-@ effective Human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin in two studies with a total of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , when the body ins@@ ulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ zed hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin is fixed . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ concentration amoun@@ ted to 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal standard ulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other constitu@@ ents , or in patients who are already suffering from a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra need to be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines which can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission shared with the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH for the in@@ securities of A@@ pi@@ dra across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is to apply as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the area of the abdom@@ inal ceiling , to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdom@@ inal det@@ ectors . &quot;
&quot; due to the decreased gl@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the dimin@@ ished ins@@ ulin delivery , the ins@@ ulin need to be imp@@ aired in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active strength , the mark ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , cast@@ or etc ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage or demo@@ lition of treatment , particularly in patients with ins@@ ulin @-@ related diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and an anti@@ diabe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ; these states are potentially viable . &quot;
conversion of a patient to another ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin should be carried out under strict physician supervision and can make a change of dosage required .
&quot; the time of the occurrence of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the isl@@ anders , and can therefore change from the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as . &quot;
&quot; to increase the substances that increase the blood@@ sugar intake and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , o@@ br@@ amine , flu@@ oxi@@ di@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ants , S@@ ali@@ zy@@ late and Sul@@ fon@@ dness antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ol@@ y@@ tika such as beta @-@ lo@@ osen , c@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reserve pin the symptoms of in@@ ep@@ in@@ ep@@ tive movements . &quot;
&quot; Tier@@ experimental studies on the Re@@ productive Tox@@ ic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in relation to pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether ins@@ ulin appears in the human mother &apos;s milk , but in general ins@@ ulin is neither into the mother &apos;s milk , nor will it be resor@@ bed after oral application . &quot;
&quot; in the following are those of clinical trials known to those undes@@ irable drug operations , group@@ ed according to system organs and ordered by decreasing the frequency of their occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on availability ) . &quot;

heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ bodies with consci@@ ous@@ nesses can be treated by a in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ co@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that is given by a correspon@@ ded person or treated by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after a glucose object , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the serious hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
ins@@ ulin lo@@ wers the blood sugar levels by stimulating the peri@@ ph@@ ate glucose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ ler@@ ans Ga@@ ther@@ - be performed faster and the active time is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normally ins@@ ulin .

ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast as normal efficiency occurs as normal human ins@@ ulin and achieves the full glucose effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; the data was evident that in an application of ins@@ ulin @-@ is@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ous gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as well as with human normal weight ulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
