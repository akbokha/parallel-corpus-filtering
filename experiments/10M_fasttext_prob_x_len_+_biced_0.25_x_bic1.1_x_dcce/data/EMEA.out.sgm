<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Relations Department (EPAR) in which it is explained as the committee on human resources (CHMP) carried out the studies conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">"if you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the package (also component of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist."</seg>
<seg id="3">"if you would like further information on the basis of CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR)."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melt tabletten, as a solution to one (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wires thinking and speakers, hallucinations (hearing or sight of things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Biking-I disorder, a mental disorder, in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high mood) alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of severe and severe severe episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients that have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied to rapid control of uninhibit unrest or behavioural disturbances if the orale intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution to one or the melting hole in patients may be applied to which the loops of tablets difficulties are prepared."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in case of patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, the dose of atbilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitter, "i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells among each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripierzole is probably acting primarily as "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters seems to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, whereby psychotic or manic symptoms decreases and their re-occur is prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, to prevent re-occur in symptoms, was examined in three studies of up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that compared to a placebo period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was tested over 12 weeks to 347 patients with Haloperdol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo, have been stabilized in 160 patients where the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of atbilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder caused by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in symptoms of patients has been examined using a standard scala disorder or the number of patients diagnosed in the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body resorbed the melting pot and the solution to the intrusion.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution, Abilify received in doses of 5,25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms increased insecurity than patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in use for the treatment of bipolar disorder decreased atbilify in four of the five short-term studies more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition, Abilify fetched up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the re-occur military episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Arbilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms increased anxiety and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify for one (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrappyramidal disturbances, dye (puzzling), vomiting (contraceppation), fatigue and exhaustion, helpers, insomnia, insomnia) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the committee for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify at the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe severe episodes with patients who had overwhelmly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes spoke to the treatment with Aripiprazole, opposite the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee also came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in rapid control of schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes with schizophrenia or patients with manic episodes in bipolar disorder, if a orical therapy is not suitable compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"June 2004, the European Commission submitted to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the transport of Abilify in the whole of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is responsible for the treatment of moderate-severe episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had overwhelmical episodes and their manic episodes have shown on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of the meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased efficacy in doses on a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients, a lower initialdose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 induction is set off from the combination therapy, the arithmeprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicide behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of anti-psychotic therapy (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increased addictive risk with Aripiazzzole has been compared to other antipsychotic antizole.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardinal coronary disease, intoxication, conditions imposed for hypotony drugs, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure drugs) or hypertonia (including acute and maligny form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports during treatment with Aripiprazole Dyskinesia."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when with ABILIFY, patients treated signs and symptoms of a spigdymis, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms, which indicate to a mns, or inclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotic medication, including ABILIFY, must be set."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazole in patients with crampant accidents in the anamnese or the states which are related to cramper in connection with caution."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis patients treated with Alzheimer's disease, an elevated mortality was treated compared to the placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted trovascular events treated with Aripiprazole patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoazide or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients with atypical antipsychotic medicines, including ABILIFY."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise evaluations of hyperglycaemia related unwanted events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic medicines treated to patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"Polydipsie, Polyurie, polyphagie, and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"gaining weight gain is generally observed for schizophrenia patients and patients with bipolar deficiency, the use of antipsychotic medication, which is known for gaining weight as a side-effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle, and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines as sedation (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-antagonist Famotidin, a stomach acid blocker, reduces the remains of Aripiazzzole, but this effect is however not relevant to be clinically relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study involving healthy probances increased a highly effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinidin), the Auc of Aripiazzzole to 107%, whereas the Cmax remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors from CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have, and therefore similar dosisreductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolisians can result the joint application with high-effective inhibitors from CYP3A4 in higher Plasmaastzole in comparison to CYP2D6 extensible Metabolisians.</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the joint gift of Ketoconazol, or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks to the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors from CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV-Proteasants, should have similar effects, and therefore similar dosisreductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-Inhibitors, the dosage should be lifted from ABILIFY to the dosage height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">"diltiazem or Escape opram) or CYP2D6 will be administered together with ABILIFY, can be calculated with a moderate increase in Aripierol- concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiazzole per day showed no significant effect on the metalliism of substrates from CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphic an / 3-methodology), 2C9 (Omeprazene) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphic)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or take a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiazzole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data situation for safety in humans and due to the concerns carried out in the case of reproductive studies, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits are clearly the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, also with other antipsychotic medication, the patients should be warned of hazardous machines, including power vehicles, to operate, until they are sure that Aripiazzole has no negative influence on it."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more often (≥ 1 / 100) than by placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">"the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100)."</seg>

<seg id="72">"in clinical studies and since the launch of the market launch, unintended or intentional exaggerations were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the effectiveness of a metamalysis in the treatment of overdose with Aripiazzole; it is unlikely that haunalysis has been used in the treatment of overdose of benefits, as Aripiazzole has a high plasma-operation."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder about the combination of a partial agonizing effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and the serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor, as well as an excessive affinity to dopamine D4-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1 epineptor and to the histamine-H1receptor."</seg>

<seg id="82">Two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder showed Aripiazzole a compared to placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder showed Aripiazzole to placebo no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placements and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, showed Aripiazzzole a compared to placebo over week 3 and a reduction effect, which was comparable to that of lithium or semioperdol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also pointed out a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the Manie as lithium or semi-operdol.</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partly reflects over 2 weeks not on Lithium- or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic Serum, revealed the accompanying therapy with Aripiazzole a superior effectiveness in reducing symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat."</seg>
