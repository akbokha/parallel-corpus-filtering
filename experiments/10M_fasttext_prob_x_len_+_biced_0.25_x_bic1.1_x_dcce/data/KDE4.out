&quot; to translate the website , you can translate at the &amp; kon@@ os@@ or ; -@@ menu under ex@@ tras . select from the list below the output and target language of the translation . &quot;
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into the entire &amp; URL . &quot;
&quot; mechanical translations are only very rudi@@ mentary . baby fish produces in the best case a crude translation and in the worst case of nonsense . therefore , the translations should not make any major decisions depending on the translation . &quot;
only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated into the Baby@@ el@@ fish page yourself where you can insert in over@@ hau@@ led texts directly .
&quot; the package &amp; package includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ os@@ or ; despite its low size , they offer some extra functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ os@@ or ; by making this easier available . &quot;
&quot; for more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual . &quot;
&quot; to load these modules at the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; choose settings to set up , open the card tools and select the desired modules . &quot;
&quot; this is a list with default modules from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system , if you have additional software installed . &quot;
&quot; you should install the package base , which &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click at the Con@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ os@@ or ; to crash , or the list of cras@@ hes , if available . &quot;
the module An@@ p@@ filter ( also called the folder filter ) you can reach in the &amp; kon@@ os@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ os@@ or ; &apos;s up @-@ to @-@ date working directory in different ways .
&quot; to view the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , choose ex@@ tras DO@@ M tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the root notes of the document , example : basic element , all other k@@ not are sub@@ elements of this root . &quot;
&quot; the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type I@@ node / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ - and text views , so that you can view the content of your local file system . &quot;
&quot; the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of a rect@@ angle hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is displayed by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must possess that the sum of the size of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder , reflects the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the file . thus , large files , even then easily be detected if they can be seen far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX , command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; it is an entry in the Tre@@ bon @-@ presentation , a rect@@ angle that represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the right hand type of colour and let@@ tering settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched on view colour mode , can be either depth for the slight detection of the shar@@ ks or the figure of another file att@@ achments like name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether enough space is to display at all or whether the surface abnorm@@ alities may occur in the sign of the tre@@ ach . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of let@@ tu@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; settings for Tre@@ em@@ aps should be observed that the area should be proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ at in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always respected . it is drawn as frames to present the sub@@ ordinate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame , when the rect@@ angle square section is lost . &quot;
&quot; as spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordinate entries , the implementation will be left . here it is for the pl@@ omas and prevention of space losses by setting are always advantageous to divide the areas that are as quad@@ r@@ ents . the best methods concerning this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimal presented area for an entry over the menu entry view . instead , a smo@@ ker pattern is drawn into the area of the or@@ derly transaction , to indicate that this area is actually supported by a sub@@ ordinate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View was intended ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , which was developed for use K@@ C@@ ach@@ e@@ gr@@ ind . &quot;
the module picture gallery you can find at the &amp; kon@@ os@@ or ; -@@ menu under ex@@ tras picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you access the picture gallery , a dialog opens with which you can set the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the option title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page .
the option images per line has a sli@@ der and a rotating field to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
&quot; to display the fil@@ en@@ ame of the picture , you determine if the file names are displayed among the thumb@@ nail pictures in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check box file size of the picture , you determine if the file size is displayed under thumb@@ nail pictures in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check box size , you determine if the size of the pictures are shown below the thumb@@ nail pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder you specify , where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection , saving in HTML file , you indicate where the HTML page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the cross@@ box sub@@ folder you can set with a sli@@ der or a rotating field , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
&quot; to copy the original pictures to the original pictures , you determine if the original pictures are to be copied into the gallery . &quot;
you can use a comment file for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery .
&quot; in the cross @-@ field self @-@ depth specify , you can adjust for the thumb@@ nails a different color @-@ deep than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; counter views ;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found at the &amp; kon@@ os@@ or ; -@@ menu under ex@@ tras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
&quot; the media playback for the navigation system can be found in the &quot; &quot; Con@@ quer@@ or &quot; &quot; menu under window navigation range , or with the keyboard short@@ cut F@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; to play in the navigation area of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to , into the media playback . &quot;
Brow@@ ser@@ recognition adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ os@@ or ; add to which you can change the browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is helpful for web sites that allow access to only with certain browsers .
&quot; the standard browser identification of the &amp; kon@@ os@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( i.e. , Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ ec@@ ko ) . if you have denied access to this browser , change the browser recognition in one of the following options . &quot;
change the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that refuse the access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla . you need for example the M@@ SI@@ E browsers to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
&quot; pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use the own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes , are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser . &quot;

&quot; easy to use camera channels made available to you so that you can connect to your digital camera and you can download them directly into your digital camera ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library of photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reading , which is supported by your operating system . &quot;
&quot; &amp; publication came ; contains a fast image processing with basic training processing tools . you can use them to review and correct your photos , review and correct . the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ tization is it ; easy to use , it is complete professional skills available . it works complete in 16 @-@ bit farms and all available modules support the raw @-@ conver@@ ge using li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC colo@@ uring - work@@ flow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens , which can be sought . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also included , an open source project . that means , it is focused on supporting the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement options . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D came to making use of problems or suggestions for them . wherever you are in the program , the help menu includes a listing of problems or requests .... This opens a dialog with a sub@@ jug@@ ated link . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your account . &quot;
&quot; this is a project that is supported by a community . that means that the user and developers came to each other . in this mailing list , we would like to answer any other users of &amp; digi@@ tization ; however , you can ask here questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ tization ; however , in this mailing list , however , you should be pleased to answer questions of other users . in this mailing list , however , you should be powerful this language . &quot;
you can also visit the website ; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; browsing ;
&quot; the best start , in order to get involved and to participate , is the registration in the developer @-@ mailing list . guide to the report in the developer @-@ mailing list from &amp; nbsp ; &quot;
&quot; for the first time you start , you will be asked where you want to store your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . just enter a folder name or click on the folder symbol folder to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data file is stored . this path remains the same for all the same folder . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add so many folders as you would like to add . &amp; nbsp ; will you additionally use as an al@@ ame library . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , the images , as a basic folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; dur@@ st searches the Bibli@@ othek@@ pathway throughout its depth . you can dis@@ connect any sub@@ folders , unless it is stored in hidden folder . this allows you to insert an extraordinary folder . do this by typing a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list are not photos as symbols . you can change by using any photo from the album and use this on the folder symbol . further details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folders , you can set up into your digital camera ; then you should learn how to manage My albums and My key@@ list to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw material support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you may also deal with it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , so you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help Cru@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ ze . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ m and Ro@@ h work@@ flow .
&quot; easy to use camera channels made available to you so that you can connect to your digital camera and you can download them directly into your digital camera ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library of photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reading , which is supported by your operating system . &quot;
modern digital cameras are viewed through the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . the camera appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized as a disk drive . older cameras will also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 is using digital cameras supported by digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is also supported the Picture Transfer Protocol , a far common protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images of digital cameras to computer machines and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos are generally large files and transfers via the serial port , this connection is now outdated . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports these cameras and guides the transfer of pictures with g@@ photo@@ 2 through . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must be created with li@@ bex@@ ec support , so that EX@@ IF support is not included in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you will perhaps be thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
&quot; one of the most beautiful things to be done , is how easy its functionality can be expanded through modules : &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plug @-@ Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ tization ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . aim is to provide the modules available to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipulate images in virtually any way , as well as a user can . your advantage is that it is considerably easier to supplement &amp; digi@@ tization ; by writing a small module to complement one function , as the changes in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; themselves to perform . &quot;
to simplify the window you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
&quot; pulling and disc@@ ard images anywhere : you can disc@@ ard a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal separ@@ ating line or in another application window . the only limitation is that a picture is not in keywords , file list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to make the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ view . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind symbol is also displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; represents an organized view on your phot@@ ore@@ s . these albums can be managed according to the folders , in which they were stored on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ chmarks or after the date when the album has been created , the album can be changed into the features of the album . &quot;
&quot; in case you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also select a scre@@ enshot directly to an album . select the album impor@@ ter scre@@ enshot . &quot;
&quot; in order to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and copy it . you can also move the photo by moving or copy . simply select all the photos and move it on the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to collect information about this collection . to access the album properties , click on the album and edit the album menu . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Collec@@ tions : are a method to highlight your albums by selecting them under a common name , if you choose to add or delete items from the tool@@ bar . if you want to add or delete items from the tool@@ bar . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album date : will be used when you sort your albums by date with view albums After date sor@@ ting .
&quot; the buttons , average , new : these are set the date on one of the oldest , the latest image , or that of the record of the album . first , this will try to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first came to an album in &amp; D , the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first photo in the album is not representative and you want to choose another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and click on the title menu ; in addition , you can select the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be scr@@ apped .
&quot; &amp; D came ; supports the input of sampling for individual photos in the section My key@@ list on the left side of the main window . album collections always include all photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this thumb@@ nails with the two lou@@ pe kno@@ bs in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time , you need to wait shortly , while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . this can be avoided , in which you can re@@ generate in the menu Extras All the thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be shown below the Pre@@ view Pre@@ view . which information this is , you can review about settings ; set up here the albums page and adjust the area thumb@@ nails of your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails feature help windows that appear . if you can rest the mouse @-@ cursor a moment about a picture . the scre@@ enshot shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the scre@@ enshot above in the section introduction into the main window displays such support window .
photos are all about what it came up at &amp; D . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the picture editing shows your photos as you can . you can choose the context menu of the preview or the menu picture in the menu bar . you can choose between the viewing images , a di@@ asch@@ au or the processing of images . &quot;
you can open the image processing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 picture editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... selecting the picture editing . with the picture editing you can view your photos and change it .
&quot; it may happen that &amp; D came ; the functionality which you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the folder menu with the right mouse button . below , and how to adjust it to your needs when your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after processing by other image processing programs can come into problems with the met@@ adata page . some programs do not save this data with , if you have changed the changed image . this way , such information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to shoot . the easiest option is to select with the right mouse button , click on the preview and select the turning . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you got a photo from &amp; browsing ; delete it in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; shifted . f@@ 8 picture del@@ eting or ab@@ stain if you prefer to del@@ eting , you can use this by entering Shift ; De@@ f . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sl@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; organizes your photos from the data . &amp; digi@@ tization ; used either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select one month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the screen view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ e@@ sheet below in the file format , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
photos with keywords provides a flexible and powerful option to organize your photos and cat@@ alo@@ ise . tags are sti@@ ckers to be assigned to the individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo you can find the photo by selecting this key@@ word or search again .
&quot; if a key@@ word is selected , all the photos , which were marked with this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this way , you can lo@@ gically organize your tags . you can also en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ate parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word &quot; &quot; cr@@ aps &quot; &quot; so you can find the tags you &apos;re looking for . &quot;
&quot; the tags are stored in a database for quick access and added key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JP@@ EG , so you can also use your tags in other programs . besides , the tags at the loss of the database re @-@ imported ; as soon as you notice the images . &quot;
&quot; you can add new tags by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word &quot; &quot; click &quot; &quot; My key@@ word &quot; &quot; button . if you have a new key@@ word , after you click on an existing password , this is the sub@@ word of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word right button and Dele@@ te . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;

&quot; &amp; D came ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the lower the difference between two image sig@@ natures , the more they correspond to . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture in order to be able to find a similar one . by using a Schw@@ ell@@ er@@ ts , the results sel@@ ector may be increased or res@@ ized . if you slide a picture of somewhere on the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then this will open up and you can let it fall there . &quot;
sketch : free @-@ hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and digi@@ tization : finds the matching pictures here . also here a s@@ ell@@ ar can be set .
&quot; this rider provides an intuitive search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can press with the mouse wheel , or pull out zo@@ oming , and post@@ p@@ one . move it while you are fil@@ tered and displayed on the left mouse button . of course , this will pres@@ upp@@ oses your pictures of Ge@@ o @-@ data . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live @-@ level folder . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization ; presents a lumin@@ ous in a separate window , with which you can easily compare pictures . he works with all supported image formats , including raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em fluor@@ tically added from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ ous and its window . if you are back in the &amp; log ; main window , you can open the ligh@@ table fast with L ex@@ tras . &quot;
&quot; from the preview , you can drag the images that you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and place it . a small dart shows you to see which copy in which window area is to be seen . so you can view the same section of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to select quickly from a picture series , then the two first pictures are automatically displayed in the fields of the tool@@ bar . you now use the left mouse button in any preview picture to view it in the right @-@ hand side . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ dering actions work directly out of the lighthouse , such as F@@ 4 File Edit .... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each sector you will find a built @-@ in line function , which you can see in the crossed arrows . in order to keep the visible area of the picture , you need to click this to click the &amp; L@@ MB . in the mode Pre@@ view the same image will display the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the zoom regul@@ ator under the pictures or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel around in the image and out into zo@@ oming . this happens in both images if you watch in the mode preview .
&quot; what is a digital survey - apart from the modem ? digital mapping management looks at any part of the process , after the picture was taken up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos has taken up , sc@@ anned or digital photos perform a form of digital stock management . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your images , protect , protect , convert and convert photos again . we look at the procedure for digital photography the &amp; digi@@ tization ; we view the download , re@@ tool@@ ing , backup , evaluate , fin@@ alised , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving , archiving ,

met@@ adata is defined as data about data . met@@ adata is provided according to your definition data that will provide information on or a documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you find more than 1000 photos on your machine , then you don &apos;t even need to know how many photos you have , then you do not even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t know how much photos you have , then use a very fast search and a secure archiving to which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and need to know before you maintain anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide whether other users want to store them on a reserved drive , or on a network drive &amp; etc ; take note that you will have to switch to a larger drive at some point . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday images can be found quickly by your location . if you have enough photos , then you will be able to make sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; you will then print a folder for images that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as verification of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % working files will have and you will then not want to organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the pile processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deri@@ v@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend the option to store met@@ adata in the settings page of Met@@ adata . this ensures that ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data is written to the file . if you forget that , then you can subsequently save the met@@ adata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu item . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what you want ? to do so , do a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , since you should now select any photo keywords , cap@@ tures and a rating . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s talk with key@@ word , keywords , as you often mean by other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import cat@@ alo@@ ised pictures from another source with embedded keywords , then it will automatically insert the tree to the correct place . the circum@@ vent of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by creating a sub@@ tree on another . the changed keywords are followed by &amp; digi@@ tization ; updated as it pursu@@ es the sub @-@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ adata is over@@ l@@ apped . this is a very rough representation , as each block of met@@ adata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tures or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alo@@ ise your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; you do not want most to see your photos easily , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then start watching some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this is the Al@@ de@@ platz of Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . wow ! you start to dream , associations , the historical time period is again present , you might even hear the silence . so the marking has completely changed your perception of this panoramic view . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create a story . remember , the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer to help Him to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work alone with a let@@ tering for itself .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can export your images to a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE provides you even a spelling check . K@@ DE provides you even a spelling check . K@@ DE provides you even a spelling examination . you will even have to tell you the story about the description and / or the title of the Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . you will have to tell you the story for a second time period . &quot;
do you remember the days before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now starts with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities to exploit the ant@@ olo@@ gues are already innumerable and will be extended in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your travel records with geographical references . you can also export the photos at the reception area . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; using the gle@@ maps @-@ viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright , and describes the practice of copy@@ rights to remove constraints on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the ordering page is required ; as information should be deposited here :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creators and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . once it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organisation , it should not be changed . this field does not support semi @-@ colon@@ ists as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for fibre line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work@@ ings of the photographer . examples for this can be titles like : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must be also filled out . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the An@@ y field to identify who the photo offers . this does not necessarily be the author . if the photographer is listed for a news agency such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here . if the picture is a bearing photo , then here the group / agency the picture is given here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although these are no protection against misuse . anyone who has no more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ators , delete or change the solution for this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is only important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
&quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ tization ; will be available in the near future , such a module for for@@ kli@@ fts . &quot;
&quot; themes : plate failure , breakdown , black@@ errors , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that can be lost on the road or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can also happen on traditional paper images or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest collection of data in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs and you must no longer be treated as a couple of years . of course , you can also keep CDs and DVDs in Archi@@ ving quality . of course , you can also keep CDs and DVDs in Archi@@ ving quality . of course , you can claim CDs and DVDs in archiving . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollar ; 2 this piece which lies a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . whether you believe that lies in your mess@@ engers . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good disco@@ s and good reception devices and you can store them in the right way . the best DVD reception devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much reliable . so it turns to the right choice . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to error , even if you have just been written only . therefore , use a control mechanism to protect itself . despite this massive protection they require for the form@@ atting , and the check@@ ers . despite this massive protection they require for chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to do wonders for CDs and DVDs . it works under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged flo@@ ppy dis@@ ks , hard disk drives , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the For@@ mat@@ war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ lay@@ er Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB , and thus almost h@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual lay@@ er DVD with 8,@@ 5 GB . all things to CDs and DVDs were also said for the Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . check out the media with a description , date &amp; author notes , and afterwards to a clean , dark dry and especially animals protected place . do not forget to read the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that the media can read . &quot;
&quot; disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing guaranteed include a new disk , but not the data . Google is on this subject a major field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives at your disposal : dis@@ mis@@ study &quot;
&quot; in brief : dis@@ ks keep the longest when you are operated in the tem@@ ar@@ tur@@ bo range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. At lower Temper@@ atures , the error messages can not determine . some of the SM@@ ART error messages will notice the immediate immediate exp@@ ir@@ ation . these are in particular readers and publishing teeth . the expected lifetime time is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this involves the complete loss of loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a black@@ out before you backed up the files , but these losses normally leave without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical appliances do not make much account , the device with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause heavy damage . in your computer this anom@@ ali@@ es blocked , complete motherboard and other defects , so protect yourself from the accident that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
the most common protection against black@@ tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed by part of the energy heat and the rest comes . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in . but remember that not every so@@ ber list contains an over@@ voltage protection .
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protecting the protection against ligh@@ tening and thereby protecting the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as a over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your machine , you should be sure that also all peripher@@ als are protected by your system . some manufacturers also provide a phone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of the cable mo@@ de@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have an emergency , you will need a portable excess of notebook . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and you also contain protection for the modem . hence , you are ideal for traveling . &quot;
&quot; while an abundance of your system protects your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even an accident of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically make cordless energy available when a power failure comes . if you purchase a US@@ V , then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time of the battery and the attached software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concern the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and and compare its security in rap@@ ids with the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be given you up to &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you keep in mind how well your computer can protect it . at the end , you should always think every cable to so@@ ar before you go into the holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web @-@ service contains S@@ 3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to store this as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; however , they cost home very expensive - 40 GB cost and dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you must send the information about the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) , and the photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free storage is available to you in full resolution online . the professional variant is not available in full resolution online . for 25 $ a year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the perspective of data backup , the Web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically closed thanks to the TCP protocol and contain the large companies in the offer a backup and a shared memory . so they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ sure . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ fs make at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely .
the worst thing is that you no one tells you when a transmission error occurred . all these disorders remain un@@ detected until you can open a picture and this to your surprise . no one seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have thought of it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that of your computer .
&quot; un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission losses as they create interference within the data streams . in normal data systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can be b@@ acked out on low levels and can be sc@@ and@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . &quot;
&quot; Oracle started an own initiative with its b@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in the Alpha status . it is still used in the alpha status , and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel . &quot;
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in notebook and 46 % at work@@ space systems . in not@@ ebooks already the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than the Me@@ alists think . it leads to a lower damage than those of theft or new installations . and it is currently not limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; it has long been no longer sighted .
&quot; open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , rout@@ ing , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the wi@@ dened fil@@ esystem . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the examination process during a surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file was not completely stored before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors of digital cameras are removed 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical limits . it is meant that the technology is further developed there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and predat@@ ory characteristics are far from this border , not far away from that border . &quot;
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution has been too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deterior@@ ating . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you can &apos;t get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro , so do not make anybody else for data loss . so do not secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the re@@ installation of your operating system , exchange of records or the size of dis@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make daily your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you lucky if the drive is not connected to the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster suggests local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft un@@ gl@@ ücke : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . you usually affect a whole room or the whole house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ ased is always a not local storage . bring your back@@ ups up into the neighboring building , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as stated above is a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
full backup : a complete backup of all the files that are to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been updated since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been updated since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time by making such a backup . this backup comes next with the exception that it is only ta@@ xed and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmis@@ sions copies r@@ sync only the difference of files that really have been changed . this happens and if you want to increase security via ssh .
secure important images directly after you stored them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium .
&quot; this approach lets you get enough time to discover losses and restore it . at the same time , you come up with a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly mom@@ entary for at least one month and a snapshot for every month . each additional drop should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; met@@ adata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , Associ@@ ated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , reproduce of pictures and met@@ adata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ... , usage of the internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot;
&quot; since the future due to your nature is unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able , you have to look at all things that are said today . unfortunately , there is no other way than going on as time passes . unfortunately , there are no other options available as the current system back@@ wards . the less variations you have used in the past , the more easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system important for reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the expert for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means enlarge .
let &apos;s go from that you have already plans the scal@@ ability and have placed the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . if you don &apos;t want to copy this area and shift it to a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ m@@ g if your new record has been detected by the system , but you do not hang them . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ d@@ b # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source / s@@ d@@ c # Source / s@@ d@@ c / b / s@@ d@@ c / Dollar ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , fatal 16 , 32 and an iron / dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of an iron case necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is there , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
gi@@ f is a proprietary , patented format that disappears slowly from the market . therefore you should no longer use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard for the G@@ IF . it can be los@@ sy , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit pro color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can be used for relative power information , but not as many as TI@@ FF , and not as many as TI@@ FF , and you would like to recommend you to save your pictures . &quot;
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss of ex@@ or@@ biting sal@@ g@@ ossi@@ m ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . a problem is however that this format is adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed free and open raw material that is developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G has been developed to uni@@ fy the camera formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is required for use of met@@ adata . a handful of camera manufacturers is now available and we hope you will use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive it from the original format , mostly in the raw format , since it saves the met@@ adata separately from the image file . however , it can be noticed if you use DN@@ G as a container and put it together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata and business models . among the activities of D@@ C@@ MI belongs to the work of architecture and modelling , discussions and workshops , standard conferences and workshops , standard links and educational efforts to reach a wider acceptance of met@@ adata and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the dealer or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the cam@@ er@@ edi@@ um , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine processing process you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ tization ; edit , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these have been cut down from other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed pictures for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them in Web@@ Gall@@ eries , enco@@ ding in MPEG , use &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; Publishing . in section add a photo to an album you will find a description , how you can add photos , which you already have on your hard drive , but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for imports from images to your Al@@ ben@@ database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; D , connect them to the computer , switch the camera on display mode and switch it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a Fer@@ ret indicator is displayed at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not appear to appear . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the file to file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera appears . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information to each entry . with the pages@@ features and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an application or its met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog displays file features and the photo information provided internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . please note that in some digital cameras , all the information is available . &quot;
&quot; the tab met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer notice , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the met@@ adata page from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tization ; or picture editing . please note that these met@@ adata for some digital cameras are not available . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button downloading and then download the pictures from their camera to a single album in &amp; Publishing . you download the photos from your camera to a single album and we recommend you to check if the pictures were downloaded safely in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired using the default optional methods of &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you selected the photos , use the button downloading and then download selected . you download the button selected as long as you selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option is new to download . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ In this case the new pictures have not been downloaded with a star in the pre @-@ window display . if you choose this option , you will of course only be downloaded the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; when you download the buttons All download or download selected appears a dialogue with which you can select the target album , shown in the list of the existing albums you can read in section My albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; D came ; loads the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the button Clear All . if you only want to delete some , you must first select this first and delete it . &quot;
please note that there is no possibility to restore the camera you have deleted from the camera . you should carefully check if the photos were successful in a &amp; version ; you should carefully delete it from the camera . if you want to fully delete it from the camera as this is substantially faster .
&quot; use cameras often use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly expres@@ sive names . this can be used to double fil@@ en@@ ames in case you download photos of different kno@@ bs into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image has been made to incorporate into the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for the turning and mir@@ rors of the image and for dat@@ at@@ based pad . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos stored on the record . the first two concern the data about the author in paragraph standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to use a different format format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % d % d : % S . turn off the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments you should read the help of the commands . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera file , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small case letters . or in case letters if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file ame , which &amp; digi@@ tization came ; for a photo , below the name appears , the camera is displayed in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; you can read all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording . not all cameras provide this information . in section side@@ bar met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic spin @-@ rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not supply this information ; the photo in original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic rotation , use the button Er@@ wi@@ red and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is information about the date on which the photo has been made , can be made available to download automatically under the same sub@@ folder . all pictures with the same date will be displayed in the same sub@@ folder . not all cameras provide this information . in the section section Met@@ a data you can read , which information your camera might have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally posted , and in this case it saves &amp; checks ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to switch this option . use the button Er@@ otic button at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos from their machine to their camera is , the button downloading . select then upload . the file optional dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that can be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you , where the images are to be loaded up to the camera . select a folder dialog for the camera . select here the desired folder and press OK to upload the up@@ loading . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . it is a position that is indicated in long@@ itu@@ dinal and latitude , which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers can link it interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to carto@@ graphi@@ es an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have later forgotten where exactly the photo was done , you can click with a click to open a browser which shows the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; page , if you want to locate a postcard to the place of photos , it &apos;s good to create the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how to get the GPS data in the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as the data in these fields are actually supported ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the correct hardware , via a post editing of GPS data and image files , with the K@@ IP@@ I module to geographic allocation ( manual ) and last on the manual input of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS @-@ interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon D@@ CS Pro Nikon D@@ CS Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel . you will have to store this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module to geographic allocation .
&quot; there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from pictures and GPS and cor@@ relate them . on the following page you can extract the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ p@@ s@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ p@@ s@@ Photo &quot;
&quot; if you know the long@@ itu@@ dinal and latitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs of hairy coordinates that can be created e.g. from m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; m@@ ap@@ s.@@ google@@ .com shows no European road cards . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D came to giving you so much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that access the behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization . to access these settings , you have to switch to these settings ; you can switch between these settings ; you can switch between them by clicking on the symbols of the left side . &quot;
&quot; action can be set in embedded pre@@ views or picture editing . they therefore set the standard behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization ; fixed , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation and copyright data . this data is automatically selected in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields . even when downloading synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author is a syn@@ onym for fibre line : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this may be desig@@ nations such as cler@@ k photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the author , this field must be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not need to be the author if this is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that the image should be available here . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC actions save the data to the corresponding IP@@ TC fields . this means that met@@ adata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ tization ; these met@@ adata are also available to other programs , and may be imported into &amp; digi@@ tization ; they shall be imported without lost . &quot;
&quot; images inv@@ itations as an embedded let@@ tering ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JP@@ EG images : this syn@@ ced the comments that you add to your photos , with the images described in the pictures , and this can be read by the pictures already ; over@@ written by the authors . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all the options for the information that appear when mouse cursor in the main window above a file rests . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tization of a number of different image formats and some video formats ; and some video formats and audio formats ; to determine which file types entered , you can add and remove file extensions , which has no one of these extensions , which has not been given . &quot;
&quot; default settings can be reset , by pressing the button Cur@@ alize on the right of each category . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the lighthouse system was set ; can be set on this page on the default values . however , when you open the light . some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode can then not be available . if you have one , then you can get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer another color , you can select this here . you can switch the tool@@ bar in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bri@@ ghter color in the picture . these colors will be specified here . in the picture editing can this view mode can be switched with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and switched off .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ aire than in the color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia about the near@@ ness statement .
&quot; using the setting of P@@ NG comp@@ lies , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since P@@ NG is required for training and un@@ packing . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . thereby , 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
with the TI@@ FF files comp@@ ress you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate -@@ Com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ists for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no influence on image quality since the De@@ fl@@ ate algorithm loss is free .
&quot; with the adjustment of low JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files , you can save loss of loss . even if you &apos;ve posted loss of loss , the ratio between quality loss and file size was far better than the normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ adata were not yet supported , but was in the planning process . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; Copyright , the picture editing was just a picture of pictures for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the standard gain is that all green pixels are the same . if the straight @-@ line green pixel of the C@@ CD sensor react when you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option features a little soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option features the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; when this option is set , the white @-@ off of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used only when the whit@@ eboard is not set . standard is it a fixed colour balance , which was photographed in the sunlight on a white card . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SL@@ R cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps will get more details in the shre@@ w . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default it is the shre@@ w , so the parts of your images are burned @-@ in , due to the in@@ ability of your camera shows the shre@@ w white in the settings . lastly , you can try to re@@ construct some unusual white in the settings . lastly , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the shre@@ w . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixel generally fails to re@@ construct green and red pixel ; and d@@ cra@@ w are trying to re@@ construct the missing blue pixel . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; when you select the option , you get the option to set up a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / therefore be adapted for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; set the l@@ umin@@ ance according to your taste . you probably need to put it a bit higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the pictures of the &amp; D ; image processing . to keep the time for the hum@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should be conservative . &quot;
&quot; a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to get a complete image from the sub @-@ fil@@ tered image sensor , which have a lot of cameras and the one matrix is also known as CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction . &quot;
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w made available three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD interaction ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm for me . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting , if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the colo@@ uring of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , since it is done during the raw material . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tization ; information about the color information from a color to translate into the others therefore the colours are as accurate as possible .
behavior issues if a picture is opened in the image processing / colour management module with raw files .
&quot; folder Set@@ ting you here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC / ICC / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed at the opening of the raw file later .
the colo@@ uring view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures coloured are not managed the whole screen .
&quot; input profiles should be made to the camera player and model that you use . not all profiles are created at the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain color mapping or gam@@ ma@@ Surgery . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not have to perform for con@@ versions at 16 bit depth . this means you have to perform the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate how your image could be given by a device , because your printer can work a smaller color range as your camera and some colors therefore very saturated . you could manually fix it rather than rely on the flas@@ hing algorithm for your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately , this is not possible to match the models of Canon . this answer is of course in@@ officially : &quot;
&quot; Canon profile extension makes the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for portrait and S for Standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewing and ima@@ gery ; many modules that have been written to cooperate with any program , which supports K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select which you want to use , and these modules appear to be downloaded from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will also find some also in the context menu of the main window . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mb@@ als for tasks which are performed by modules , can be set in the menu under settings short @-@ command . &quot;
&quot; for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get through the K@@ IP@@ I project among htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ging .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator j@@ us@@ hes the time between the outputs , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds is good . the other shr@@ ubs turn off the met@@ adata on the bottom of the images during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show a list of all supported cameras on the left side . on the right there is a button Autom@@ atic detection , which is trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . currently , you find that the camera is connected , and on the image level mode . currently , here are serial port , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ n / camera or / m@@ nt / , to which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; D , you need to connect the camera to your computer and switch it into display mode . &quot;
&quot; check out whether &amp; D came out , the camera automatically recognises . if not , you can set camera od@@ ell and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any designation for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert it here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confir@@ ming dialog for reloc@@ ating &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ts ; in del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the cuts of a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find more details . &quot;
editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly used by the right side bar ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any feedback . otherwise you need to apply changes to the button modifications .
you can also notify the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ tization ; it may be accelerated in accordance with the start @-@ up of &amp; D .
&quot; the setting Bei@@ m starts looking for new photos , forcing &amp; D came to search for new or deleted albums . this prolon@@ gs the start @-@ time following new or deleted albums . if something from the base file has been deleted , asks for it ; you whether it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schem@@ as can be found in &amp; D ; used to adjust the main window to your liking . these settings can be selected among settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tization ; find more information about it in this tutorial .
&quot; &amp; publication came ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to correction and improvement . image processing can be started by clicking on the preview of an image , or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry . &quot;
the picture editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . so some of them are not part of your distribution . so you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the image processing .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current date number , magni@@ fying factor , and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top of the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
&quot; however , the editing functions of image processing changes your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original shot before you use File Save or the button save from the tool@@ bar . please note that the original photo will no longer be re@@ saved as soon as you have saved the picture . &quot;
&quot; so , you should be able to make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file saving as well . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using it from the menu file re@@ manufacture or the button The button re@@ manufacture the picture editing in tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last saved . &quot;
virtually any action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting Edit back or restored by selecting Edit re@@ manufacture from the menu .
&quot; if you are using this frequently , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to get back and make C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to re@@ manufacture . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you get a context menu . if you choose one of the menu entries , all actions will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you start the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can enter the photo and out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the An@@ si@@ fication menu .
&quot; to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlar@@ ging factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode , the photo shows in full screen mode . normally you do not use the tool@@ bar . normally , you can call the tool@@ bar . normally , you can call this page dialog . you can view this section for setting the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the image file in the menu and get the standard &amp; c@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual pictures or whole phrases . you only need to select the pictures with the default methods and export out the menu album . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Trial arrived ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images , also available in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five horse@@ power is clicked : &quot;
&quot; multi@@ f@@ aches clicking on the same rider leaves the side@@ bar , or disappear again into the edge . &quot;
&quot; in the description , you can enter cap@@ tures with unlimited size or insert . this means that all special characters are allowed . the description will be copied into the EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are re@@ formed after 2000 characters and are re@@ formed , if you want to use the IP@@ TC button in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented on , use either the button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tures are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the use button , there is one button More . with this you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or database . however , this is always done if you choose a met@@ adata setting that is always written in the pictures . &quot;
the section rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ ting boards . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field yet . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keywords will show a search box to filtering the keywords , the sampling tree , and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; version ; -@@ session concluded . &quot;
the sampling tree will be dynam@@ ically adjusted to the search term . you can limit the number of options when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the lower end is another relief when entering sampling at a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by flag@@ ging the respective an@@ cross fields in the tree . all words of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
&quot; if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the point tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not on the whole selection , if you want to make a selection using a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word section . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar key@@ note filter is used to change the selection of images shown in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , sampling , and view@@ points . if additionally one or more sampling filter is used from the right side , only the inter@@ sections of these two are shown . all the keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and disc@@ ard it . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and place on the selection . then a dialog , which you ask if you want to put the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example the main window displays the images on one calendar day . the key@@ word filter is reduced to no keywords , which has been selected by Str@@ g + a , and after that a key@@ word was drawn from the right @-@ tree @-@ tree to the selection and ask it . a dialogue asks if this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes will take place at any start of the program . it can also be switched on options Miscellaneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or its , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is sought after . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already placed in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can specify an extensive search on all the elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group . the options are as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I &apos;ve made it mainly to &amp; D ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why one uses a color @-@ managed work@@ flow is to have the colors used by your camera or scanner . with a color@@ fully managed work@@ flow you can reach that the colors on your monitor those of your camera or scanner or the colors you print or on the web that you are able to print from your digital dark room .
&quot; when the theme is coming to color administration , everyone wants to know which buttons he wants to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with adequate information about color management . the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with deeper information to make you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image work@@ flow ful@@ fills all of the criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color administration . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB color . ( further information can be found below )
your only other picture expendi@@ tures are by e @-@ mail or the Web where s@@ R@@ GB of de facto standard is .
so when s@@ R@@ GB so well works and life for everyone makes it so easy why you should use another color space and thus have to worry about colour management ?
&quot; a visual example of the Lim@@ itation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ hoe @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms so visit Lin@@ d@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente site and then click on information and then on information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to turn@@ around my monitor if I decided to work only in the R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ R@@ GB colour collection or not , you need to work your monitor , since s@@ R@@ GB does so close the circle . if you work as in the Far@@ ming of s@@ R@@ GB , you need to either use your monitor on the R@@ GB standard , you need to either use your monitor on the R@@ GB standard , a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual process . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , the same , automatic scanning and contrast will expand the best menu automatically from your colours . you will need to experiment with these effects , to see which best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ous values on the whole picture so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ gh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its color sh@@ unting . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed .
&quot; same : this method j@@ us@@ hes the lumin@@ ous factor in the colors of the selected image , so that the h@@ isto@@ gram of the Inten@@ sity is as flat as possible . thus , the final very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation which either causes miracles to a picture or it was destroyed . &quot;
&quot; automatic inspection : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the red , green and blue channel . it represents the dark and bright fron@@ ts and j@@ us@@ hes the red , green and blue channels on the entire H@@ isto@@ gram region . &quot;
&quot; contrast , contrast , this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by putting the lowest and highest values in the highest possible area and a new ji@@ ver of all values in between . this is only visible on washed images and can be a good correction for poor photos . &quot;
the white @-@ off from &amp; D came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry the white off of a photo .
&quot; the white @-@ straight correction is slightly limited as to a color @-@ room with 8 @-@ bit per colour . in case you can perform to far from the original picture , in case you can perform the whit@@ eboard in the rough mode , so your possibilities for correction can be better . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a whit@@ eness , protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . they start it via the menu @-@ application colors white @-@ off of the picture editing . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails can be adjusted in size . on the left hand , both the original image and the preview of the Target . preview is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white right , then it is enough to click the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ anz of the pixel among this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the h@@ isto@@ gram .
right above will be displayed a h@@ isto@@ gram that is dynam@@ ically changed once you change a parameter . this h@@ isto@@ gram is very helpful as soon as you see a parameter . this h@@ isto@@ gram is very helpful as to whether one of the three colours or total is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz .
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow &apos;s shade lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or also down . &quot;
&quot; An@@ stat can play with the controls mentioned above , you should use the color temperature @-@ p@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then anywhere in the image to calculate the color temperature of the white @-@ comparison . this way the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white off with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. you will display the combined result in the white color . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
&quot; the buttons save as and loading do exactly this . each setting of the white @-@ comparison you have set , you can save it into a text file and later load again . &quot;
&quot; the button pres@@ ets puts back all the filter values again on its standard values and the associated white gl@@ ar@@ ks . refer to that even neutral settings create a different photo as your original . if you store this , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust here the enco@@ ding sti@@ ff per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widely spread JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is better for high quality images . this code also needs more disk space , computing time and stands on@@ ly@@ for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialog like the processing of raw material . it uses the change and assignment of colour profiles . colour mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the use of colour profiles . a detailed guide for the use of colour profiles can be applied to the chapters of color administration . &quot;
another important tool is available in the menu under colors ton@@ la@@ sty and allows you to use multiple color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or sc@@ anners can always make the same mistake and you can always need the same correction . in the manual for ton@@ ing correc@@ tions you find more information .
a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for the gra@@ dation that you can find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; tool Far@@ ming effects provides you four colour effects , a solar @-@ effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a channel filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of being created by the added light . this had the effect that the hell@@ ish areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illum@@ ination . this tool was a part negative of the picture . this tool allows you to fin@@ alize this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar zation . at about 50 % intensity , the image shows what chem@@ ically possible is possible . another up@@ surge finally generates a neg@@ ativity that is not produced on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of solar energy efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and edit the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that makes it a stronger contrast @-@ effect that makes the colors brilliant and smooth . try it easy to em@@ bell@@ ish many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on day@@ light optimized color movie created by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and with it a reference for his smooth image structure . Vel@@ vet offers very saturated colours but also some photographs of photographers - especially those which hardly differ landscapes .
&quot; the ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrasts . the parameter level controls the brightness of result and the sli@@ der repeat the strength of the ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . at large pictures , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color contra@@ ast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools at preview . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the opposite problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can be a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation . all changes you can perform in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes made with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue is very complicated for this tool , you need only the area of the sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ der below the h@@ isto@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of Inten@@ sity values , a h@@ isto@@ gram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph there are three sli@@ ders into the inside and which can be moved to change the intensi@@ fication of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ator and observe it on how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right hand side you can see the original and preview of the picture . the preview is dynamic , updated using the settings of the picture , updated . on the left hand , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set , whether the h@@ isto@@ gram is presented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . in pictures the large areas of a constant color is dominating the linear h@@ isto@@ gram of a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic division is useful . &quot;
&quot; three controllers : the top for the dark sounds , the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle sounds , often gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color @-@ pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image , to automatically convert the input test of shadows , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; ga@@ des : the outputs allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to assess the utilisation rate , for example , using the compression of the exc@@ uses can be used for example to create a light picture as background while something else in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this kno@@ b , the image values are automatically set in dependence on the values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and loading : with these buttons , the data file can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded again . the Gimp levels will be used . &quot;
&quot; when you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the inputs automatically want to use it for all shade , means and solar panels . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ous channels . &quot;
the option over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that means you &apos;ll get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect to see the final result .
&quot; below you can see an example of the alignment of the inputs applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the discharge are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original is displayed and the target picture is displayed . the preview will be dynamic depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
modifications Channel : this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel that is changed from the module :
&quot; besides this box , two symbols are to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures featuring a digital camera , the linear mode is the most sensual mode . in this case , the linear mode is generated a broad beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will continue . &quot;
&quot; if you move , for example a short panel to the right , for example the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds are corresponding with dark words and the corresponding image pixel will be darker . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er . if you want to change this mark@@ er in the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that is the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is de@@ ported to your liking . &quot;
&quot; save as and loading : with these buttons , you can make exactly this . each curve you can have created with it in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format is the Gimp Kur@@ ven@@ format . &quot;
&quot; if you want to create this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ ted buttons , you automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of shadow , central and Sundays . click on the original image to set the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ve curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator that is , you &apos;ll get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a black @-@ white photo , which was corrected in L@@ umin@@ anz@@ canal . shadow and Sundays was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
the channel mix@@ er of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color gra@@ dations of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er of image processing .
&quot; with the channel op@@ box , you can select the color for the h@@ isto@@ gram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be seen as compared to your own rider . &quot;
&quot; the view of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line in the h@@ isto@@ gram will display the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are on the right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to manage these channels . this is especially convenient if you can also activate the respective color components as the channel mix@@ er then DAS tool for generating great black @-@ white con@@ versions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a colour leads to a visible noise which comes from the color . color@@ fully consists of small predat@@ ors , which does not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose smoking pattern is different in each channel . if that is the case you can reduce your mono@@ chrome conversion thereby in which you reduce the color . &quot;
the storing and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender @-@ setting can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gimp @-@ channel mix@@ er format .
the option over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that means you &apos;ll get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel is re@@ directed . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is activated . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step as color images can be converted into the machine . also with a set of film roll@@ out profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good at all the scenario images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so like the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
&quot; Oran@@ fil@@ ter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air @-@ photos . so much like the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange . &quot;
&quot; red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates a dramatic sky@@ light and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar @-@ light to day time . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) red filter . &quot;
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : generates warm bright and medium tones while it adds a bit cold in the sho@@ cks of a pressure and the re @-@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photographs of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; recording ; tool texture , you can apply decorative textures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it is a color screen or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points , or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry can be used to apply the image processing . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the semb@@ lance of the depth and the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture in the image .
a paper Tex@@ tu@@ f@@ ect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; recording ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of an be@@ holder in the limits of an photos is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stre@@ ak eye . under image frame the module can be started from image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you place the desired cream type for your picture . thoroughly , the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce um@@ ran@@ ged it with a nice three @-@ dimensional setting ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , exhau@@ sting it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button @-@ effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the value area for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio will have . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can insert simple a form@@ at@@ ted text into an image at any point . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use the text output , orientation , color from the color bag and the character set with its characteristics as you need . the bigger the picture , the larger must be the character set . at the end , you simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ sighted background . already the picture is ready . &quot;
&quot; any attitude you chose for your text may be changed until you press on the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . &quot; after the picture has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; recording ; tool Sh@@ abl@@ one , you can use a template for a picture . &quot;
the menu image Sch@@ abl@@ one uses in the image processing can be used to put c@@ ann@@ ons over a picture .
&quot; for the template , there are no restrictions on the size and the orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should be able to add with maximum comp@@ utation ( 9 ) to cl@@ apping the file size of the template , so send an email in English to the &amp; D ; mailing list requires @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for first time , you need to set your scrap@@ ing folder with the button basic folder in dialogue . select the folder in which you copied the Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ ges . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root @-@ file has been set for the sten@@ cils , a construction view that reflects the folder structure of the Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ ord@@ ner and the selection of a folder is updated automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fier factor and the position of your image . &quot;
&quot; enlarge : this button increases the picture @-@ lying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; smaller : this button smaller the underlying image . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image according to the mouse . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to post@@ p@@ one the picture below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
&quot; OK , if you want to apply the template to your image . the picture is then adjusted automatic to the thumb@@ size . &quot;
&amp; D came ; poses three different tools to score . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharp@@ ens is a traditional tool for edge . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gran@@ ates images . &quot;
shar@@ pen mask works on the contrast of edges to look at an image sharp@@ ens . in fact it &apos;s not a bit it works rather psych@@ op@@ u@@ ell . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it &apos;s here a really good job . the algorithm has been taken out of Gimp and he is copyri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three because he really improves the sharp@@ ness . he is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as the most digit@@ alized pictures need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this in turn leads to a common color combined with just minimal difference to a color point . this in turn leads to a common color printed . SL@@ R cameras normally need more bear@@ able shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
&quot; with JP@@ EG images , a camera has often been applied to internal sharp@@ ness . on the other hand , images in the shell must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during the processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner contact a sharp@@ ness filter already during the reading of the picture . if you disable it , you get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can obtain useful results by shar@@ pen a photo with the field of field of sharp@@ ness . this allows you to call the menu entry of correc@@ ting sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; but you should deal with caution , because the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but also ampli@@ fied the noise . in general , the most useful technique to raise an image the tool Re@@ focused . among re@@ focus you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too tight . the solution to draw the picture a little soft , is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft@@ ness with the menu entry fee , and experiment something with settings . the preview on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help the image to edit . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are often good results , and should first be tried out . an increase in radius or the amount ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the im@@ meas@@ ur@@ ly mask to be strong , noise and impression of gr@@ ats are produced near sharp edges . &quot;
&quot; the radius shows how many pixels are affected by the filter at each side of a channel . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ os . therefore , they should be able to raise pictures of the best in its final resolution . &quot;
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ at@@ ted image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the s@@ wan value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable difference amount . this way , a minimum difference can be used for a can@@ ter of filters . in this way areas with a soft shift between the tones of shar@@ pen is excluded and therefore beauty error in the faces , Himm@@ ler and water @-@ surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the converted image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a s@@ wan value = 0.@@ 0 . &quot;
the &amp; D came ; tool re@@ focus is focused on an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used to be used by copyright protected by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to re@@ vert a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ focused quot ; in which it &apos;s better approach than just trying the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tering . it is using a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tering . you can often launch better results as un@@ sharp mask . you can start it out of the menu by drawing colors re@@ focus in the picture editing .
&quot; in practice , the circular F@@ altung works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche &apos;s F@@ altung has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical outcome also from the original pixel rate . the F@@ IR Mun@@ in@@ verse the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen F@@ altung , in most cases , is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixel . this causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular F@@ altung . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . you can set a higher value if your image should be very bl@@ ur@@ red but then refer to Heiligen@@ pons .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; smoking filter : an increase in the smoking filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.@@ 1 is only rarely useful . if the smoking filter can be too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will be added to the image even further . &quot;
&quot; gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your in@@ shar@@ per Gau@@ ß is caused . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 , to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 , to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 so you may also increase the correlation and / or the rob@@ bery filter . &quot;
&quot; mat@@ ri@@ m size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ational size . an increase in the mat@@ ch@@ size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular shar@@ pen@@ ing or the Gau@@ di &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow when you choose large values for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; the storing and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each of any re@@ focus parameters you have set will be saved for later , and can then be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try all the cutting , color and Inten@@ sive en@@ cor@@ es on the picture before using the module . &quot;
otherwise you should use the module before you change the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible are left but later left un@@ pleas@@ urable ar@@ te@@ facts .
&quot; if you want to read and comp@@ ress the images , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should use the module to the un@@ zi@@ pped image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp meas@@ les produces better results than cutting . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a bigger neighborhood as a sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; theoretically , un@@ sharp mas@@ quer@@ ying must always remove ar@@ te@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never let the effect of shar@@ pen@@ ed filters . practically the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters is always just as good as the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask . the F@@ IR Vienna filter is often better with the processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp colour display has to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
&quot; for more information about the methods of shar@@ pen@@ sion@@ ism in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
&quot; the regul@@ ator le@@ av@@ ed sets the im@@ meas@@ ur@@ ly of the area of the dark , to produce a more natural P@@ up@@ ille . &quot;
&quot; the colour tin@@ ts enables a customized color for the p@@ up@@ ille . if you want a blue eye instead of dark , you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool@@ error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove not desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the algorithm has been developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; this tool contains different preferences as a starting points to simplify the restoration . the settings available are below , below : &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the filter settings fine , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; details &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a consistent smooth@@ est over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be given details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should always be sub@@ stituted . please note that the details of the details should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; direction @-@ dependent Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value inserted even@@ ly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a movie bas@@ kets or create C@@ CD Rau@@ l . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts will be fixed at a value close to 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum ill@@ age factor above all en@@ umer@@ ated then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore set this value suitable for the degree of smoking in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary , as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeat : returns to how often the algorithm is going through . usually here 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle @-@ wide there &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha are chosen , there should also be small . make sure that small corner will generate a long term . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral circuits &#91; 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integral circuits in pixel . you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixels @-@ smooth@@ ing and never exceed 2 . &quot;
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the More high quality you get through choice of this option is only small . it doubles its term . we therefore recommend it to allow him to let it go .
&quot; the buttons save as and loading do exactly this . each setting of image defects can be correct hereby saved into a text file , and later be loaded again . &quot;
&quot; image defect is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and draw a high CPU load upwards . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button ab@@ rupt . &quot;
below you can see how pictures with little arti@@ facts can be corrected . the module is used on a photo that is caused in Guatemala City with an analog camera while the trip is caused ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; smoke reduction is a powerful tool to decrease it . it uses a copyri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides a sel@@ ectable image filter available to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts that can be removed from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mos@@ ses ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information on digital camera cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; the scre@@ enshot shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high standard sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ de noise , which can be successfully removed with this tool . &quot;
&quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you will only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window of advanced settings may remain in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the size size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter per pixel is needed , and the image in it moves over the image and the color in it will be spot@@ ted and thus a minor error . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the pixel rate . this value sets the pixel rate to notice ligh@@ th@@ read@@ ings . you may need to change the edges filter , if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter details can no longer be obtained and rou@@ gh@@ tens up again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not get the total noise away or smoking tips can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a little noise or JP@@ EG @-@ ar@@ te@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controlled the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the glasses process which is controlled by the details of the settings .
color : controlled the color intolerance of the picture . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the glasses process which is controlled by the details of the settings .
&quot; Gamma : controlled the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ anc@@ ings of the dark areas , which typically obli@@ ges stronger , however , it also lubric@@ ates the shadows . &quot;
&quot; absorption : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ ig@@ d@@ amping absorption . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius is responding to variations of the ligh@@ tness . if it is up too high , the edges may appear too high . he can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter on edges . he can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; storing and loading : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for smoking reduction , which you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how harsh reduction of your life can change . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with standard settings .
&quot; sometimes , a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft , is fortunately much easier than to raise a picture and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the pre @-@ window display on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce phot@@ ar@@ te@@ facts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ C@@ aper , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sor and local mistakes made in digital , original , or subsequently digit@@ alized pictures , and thus preserves the content as it is also the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and text composition . the text structure is performed with another tool , the image error correction , the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ola and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
JP@@ EG ar@@ te@@ facts reduce : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss of com@@ pres@@ sion@@ age and quot ; ar@@ te@@ ar@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed picture . this attitude aims to correct these problems . &quot;
&quot; the buttons Save and charging exactly this . each setting of photo restoration may be saved into a text file , and later be loaded again . &quot;
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take a long time and draw a high CPU load upwards . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ end .
below you can be restored like a photo with equ@@ ali@@ zable noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was created with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gra@@ ins on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time textures was allowed to see an old paint photo that was created with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were caused by the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; tool hot@@ pixel allows for hot pixel of photos showing with a C@@ CD camera , eight were taken to remove . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ t . &quot;
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixel are particularly in high @-@ quality raw material photos a problem as many cameras with JP@@ EG compression over a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixel . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with an dark image to remove . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel . &quot;
download this file to the wizard with the button dark . the tool will detect an automatic and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the picture .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important that you will take the dark picture directly into the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through C@@ CD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the corrected picture . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixel . please note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and will automatically load it in the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview help you correct the result of the image . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are taken up in all areas of view .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ l this pix@@ el@@ bucks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ing : it is determined an average of the neighbouring pixel . the resulting color will be assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 by the pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ed the def@@ ective pixels on the block .
square : this is the default method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block to calculate to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ l the pixel in block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be dra@@ gged to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ed the def@@ ective pixels on block .
&quot; below you can see the hot pixel correction to a color photo , from a broken digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; D came ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fier correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; vast@@ ness , especially those in the middle and large photo format , in particular the whole sensor area cannot illumin@@ ate the whole sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the light that reaches the sensor there . Tele@@ objective may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he also has draw@@ backs . many Center @-@ filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the blood filter , which it is impossible to hold the camera with your hand . expan@@ sive lenses , also with center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise im@@ meas@@ ur@@ red effects arise through motion . &quot;
&quot; with the great exposure of today &apos;s filtration and color scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by simul@@ ating an ä@@ qui@@ val@@ ent transformation an image without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fier is used by a C@@ enter@@ filter on an image . the algorithm is copyri@@ ghted by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controllers , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fier filter and with three further exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of lumin@@ osity at the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , which offset an optical filter with a bl@@ en@@ den@@ sing of 1 , or by chance to compens@@ ate the density to a larger degree of Vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fier correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to re@@ boot the exposure of the target with these options , since you only need to increase positive values as you just need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er change of exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; D ; image processing of the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ con@@ ical correction to an image . the original image ( 1 ) displays the correc@@ ting image in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a leu@@ ch@@ asing and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fications is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos . it uses a copyri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geom@@ etric distor@@ tions . coloured distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ des treats the general geom@@ etrical distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ exe form of the picture .
the co@@ efficient of the third Gra@@ des has a similar circuit effect but fla@@ p on edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ des corrected the distant rough opposite to that of the second Gra@@ des . if you combine these two can be almost eliminated any geom@@ etrical distor@@ tion .
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the second gra@@ des . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values are ver@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth Gra@@ des . this value acts stronger in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners named the reverse character of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the size and thus results in correction first gra@@ des through . negative values enlarge while positive the image are smaller .
bright : this value j@@ us@@ hes the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they increase .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialogue with a preview the distor@@ ting correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used as standard values . &quot;
&quot; the ton@@ s. or kis@@ ses correction should be carried out before all the cutting or size changes . at best , you perform this correction as all . if you have a picture anew to cut and then perform a ton@@ ing correction , the effect would be apparent from the folding . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction you will find this tool a vertical and a horizontal aid line . move it to an important place , such as the maritime edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ s. / kis@@ ses with the help of the lines . &quot;
if you correct a ver@@ b @-@ shaped distor@@ tion the resulting image will have black corners . you can trans@@ duce them with the cutting tool in the menu transform@@ ational cutting out of image processing or on the zoom controller of this dialogue .
&quot; for most images the tone @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs , such as shots from the front , frame and painting it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ ing correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infr@@ ared belts of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter reproduced the well known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; beneath the preview , you can adjust two parameters set the bas@@ kets and cinem@@ at@@ eness ( ISO ) . enable the option to simul@@ ate the gra@@ ined texture of a highly sensitive movie . the ISO Re@@ gler changes the quantity of gran@@ ular texture and dominance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter colors to reproduce infr@@ ared film , especially the green channel , it does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of infr@@ ared fil@@ me@@ tic applied to a landsc@@ ap@@ ing photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . higher value of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a type of au@@ ra in the shre@@ w .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; filter film@@ maker is an easy to use tool to reproduce film gra@@ ins on your pictures , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the movies , the manufacturers mix large silver gran@@ ites of the phot@@ em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the cinem@@ atic effect effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . in case you want this specific , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight specifically in your mono@@ chro@@ ms photos , so you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ulation of the Kör@@ ner calibr@@ ated . standard value is , although frequently higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more Kör@@ ner , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the cinem@@ at@@ tainment effect effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this worked ( 2 ) . the used film @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; D came ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses the copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; D came ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and style life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controllers around this effect . the top sel@@ ects the p@@ endant @-@ size between one and five . thicker brus@@ hes are better for large images . smooth controls controlled the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side seen , the magnific@@ ence . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the original one with the ( 2 ) . Pin@@ ch size for this 640 pixels big picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; filter carbon @-@ drawing is used color and Inten@@ sive gra@@ dient to define a coal and intention . therefore , pictures of their gra@@ dients are slowly changing , therefore it is not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful when you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline for you . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
&quot; there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller , select the pin size and the lower contrast , the contrast ( smooth@@ ed ) . &quot;
this is an example of the carbon filter filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved even further by adapting the Inten@@ sive value .
&quot; the &amp; D came ; filters engra@@ ving your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was sty@@ led in wax . it uses a copyri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; D came ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where colour is not the most important thing in terms of content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ stro@@ ve landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth is allowing to stop the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds 10 % , is the default . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the original image ( 2 ) . the original depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ tion &apos;s effects . it used by copyri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alogue to wave @-@ blocks 1 will be distorted the image here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can ab@@ ort these effects anytime with the button Be@@ end .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of un@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it used by copyri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom un@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image along the ern@@ fo@@ erde lines that go from a centre . this simul@@ ates the discomfort of a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography .
radi@@ al im@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by rotation of the pixels to a central point . this simul@@ ates the im@@ sharp@@ ness of a revol@@ ving camera .
removal un@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the picture to create the effect of a focused camera lens . the object seems to come back in the background .
&quot; movement of movement : bl@@ ur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a linear moti@@ ons , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera . &quot;
soft @-@ sharp@@ ness Un@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this produces photos with a dre@@ amy and gle@@ aming soft focuss@@ ing effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or add a warm and subtle light . &quot;
&quot; shame is bl@@ ur@@ red , bl@@ ur@@ red the picture through random shifting of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the im@@ sharp@@ ness of an arbitrary movable camera . &quot;
intelligent Un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the color basin in the picture and bl@@ ur@@ red this without change the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and created it then , by filling with an average pixel rate . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can therefore inter@@ rupt this calculation at any time with the button Be@@ end .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture . this makes it natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyri@@ ghted algorithm .
trou@@ gh size allows it to change the size of the ble@@ p . since the dri@@ p size is not automatically generated with the size of the image . number changes the number and the density of drops . fish changes the optical effect of the drop in the picture .
&quot; you can use the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing an area free of shelves . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face , which shall remain free . if you start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p , the area will remain free of shelves . &quot;
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the converted image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ers turning or transform@@ ers . &quot;
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is to smaller . the big question is , how can you get a picture infl@@ atable and the details sharp ? how can you get the missing information once more or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here , makes it a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it on the desired size using the tool size . choose to change your size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below to see .
&quot; the tool for size changes a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to get the pixel . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate . &quot;
many imaging programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation ( e.g. spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ tization : used a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ atable was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , when entering the new size , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary , as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons save as and charging will be used exactly for this . each entry for photo can be saved as a text file and later be loaded again .
photo infl@@ atable is very fast with what it makes but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load upwards . you can break the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ end .
&quot; you can see an example for photo infl@@ atable , by adding a small color screen on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement to compare . &quot;
&quot; cutting of a photo is not only a commonly carried out surgery , but also a commonly underestimated tool to compile an image . you simply need to create a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull the rect@@ angle , then you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . thus , you can change a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . you can create a new rect@@ angle by simply drag it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button &quot; &quot; access button &quot; &quot; button in tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file save or file saved under the menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue remains . &quot;
&quot; in the tool to cut aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross format . in the high format , the larger value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; adding a relative aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you can use centimeters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see , e.g. , a list of traditional dimensions for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialogue , two buttons exist for the selection automatically horizontal or vertical . &quot;
&quot; below Dialog you can set up with the Max . proportional to the area for cutting on the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you are using the cutting tools , these settings are stored as standard values depending on the orientation . the changed image measurements are stored in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the image and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the meeting point will allow help to get in touch with so that you can put your images better . these help include :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic ponds are based on the principle of similarity . as the third @-@ hed@@ geho@@ gs are harmon@@ ic triangles a way to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles at the di@@ agon@@ als .
&quot; Golden Middle : the Golden middle is a division that leads to various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us Musch@@ el or the leaf@@ lets of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the Golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 18@@ 0@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used their temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 ,
the golden middle presents liquid assistance lines when you put an image together . these help will be listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you to your destination good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ party rule the golden spiral leads through the eye through the image . this kind of composition carries the view of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates an asymm@@ etrical river .
&quot; a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called Golden rect@@ angle . it should give something that the eye is at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this something can be just there without being the eye , it will fulfil its mission . &quot;
&quot; the Golden triangles are also guided from the top of the golden spiral lines . your verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangular corner . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , Golden triangles are not equ@@ ilater@@ al triangles . di@@ ag@@ onal to put on these lines can be a static object dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden triangles to break up your frame you create a effect of professional photographers . try your image fo@@ kus at one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition you can &apos;t reach differently .
the options called horizontal and can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic ponds .
&quot; with the button color , you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the aid lines can be invisible . this way , you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to turn an image to any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you are not exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things turned around a corner . you can repair this with the &amp; D ; image processing and tool free rotation . select this transform@@ ational free rotation and j@@ us@@ hing the target angles . &quot;
&quot; turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the button preferences , you can set the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right side of the window . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the module is free rot@@ ation to position a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , j@@ us@@ hing the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you filmed a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix this , it is the function transform@@ ational cutting from image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the function auto @-@ cut . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the spin . however note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tive transformations are performed by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialogue you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , into pixel . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , into pixel . &quot;
angle left top : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left bottom : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : displays the current angle at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; according to the adaptation of the perspective , the picture will be a little spar@@ ed . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get im@@ pregn@@ able tri@@ angular holes to the corners . a way to ber@@ some it is the image with transform@@ ational cutting from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the foam tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal shot is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ elo@@ gram . you can start this module about transform@@ ers . &quot;
sc@@ iss@@ ors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can push horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the thumb@@ nail .
&quot; for your help , a vertical and horizontal line appears appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and push the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the foam tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after having carried out the shot , the picture will be a bit confused . for a single appearance , this effect is generally neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sl@@ ings produces twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and hence , you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the shot , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate it is to cut the image with transform@@ ational cutting from image processing . &quot;
&quot; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are comp@@ uted . in most of the distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of images formats . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and TI@@ FF below . &quot;
&quot; if the extension is shown in the formats of the file . if the extension is shown in the list , it is displayed in the file editing . if the extension is shown in the listing . you can modify this list of the file exp@@ and@@ ments ; in the section configuration you will find more information . &quot;
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to even select the format to select . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; nbsp ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression to digital images . thereby redund@@ ant information is reduced in order to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general there is better , smo@@ other results than JP@@ EG in the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also save loss when it is stated in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to find out more about the raw material , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous , and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format pictures in JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF with the raw screen verter of &amp; digi@@ tization ; in the section configuration you can find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; the loading of raw materials is supported only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ tization ; all cameras can be found at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials supported by &amp; D ; supported by : &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are frequently saved in Avi@@ - or MPEG @-@ Format . however , these formats are frequently used in Avi@@ - or MPEG @-@ format ; but it does not understand film editing program , and it is not a film editor . &quot;
move forward to the previously visited album in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you have gone back .

all con@@ fig@@ ted cameras will be en@@ umer@@ ated here . you can add the camera from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please check the camera up for more information .
K@@ IP@@ I module is a series of images exported to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth .
&quot; if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initi@@ ale contrast was very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the module white . &quot;
a lot of tools you need to do the photo editing are included in this page . your description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ness , soft@@ ness , distor@@ ting , un@@ bl@@ ur@@ ging , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc . . use a uniform dialog type before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture applicable ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress beam shows the status of the filter to the current image . links from it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the fores@@ try area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected suburbs .
horizontal divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter apply to the area below the selected pres@@ sor area .
ver@@ tically divide . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the filter &apos;s effect .
horizontal . the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the thumb@@ nail , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general setting page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose the preview . you can take this frame with the mouse within the picture and disc@@ ard it in the part of the picture you will see the preview . the preview in the left part of dialogue will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained . it is group@@ ed into the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters for shooting the photos . these data are provided by the EX@@ IF data when this is available .
&quot; this rider provides an intuitive search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can press with the mouse wheel , or pull out zo@@ oming , and post@@ p@@ one . move it while you are fil@@ tered and displayed on the left mouse button . of course , this will pres@@ upp@@ oses your pictures of Ge@@ o @-@ data . &quot;
&amp; G@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ allets files . the application can be used for editing of color pal@@ ettes and for choosing and burning colors .
&quot; the p@@ allets files , which are by &amp; k@@ de ; be installed either for the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; attitudes and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog range , you can select from a list of the p@@ allets available , or search the folder to files . &quot;
the cursor is shown in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by cl@@ adding to the area next to one color .
it shows the color adjacent to it . the color is described below the p@@ allet view . here also the color name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click the area next to one color to move the cursor up there . then move the mouse with op@@ pressing lin@@ ker right mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the an@@ kreu@@ z is activated under the button color is enabled , the color is inserted from the color panel on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode has been selected or write . this mode can be set by selecting the check box over@@ write under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection which has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the promotions , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a pointer sign , if another color is following . if three num@@ eric characters are in the cli@@ p@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; color@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select one color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left side .
&quot; graphic software is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; graph@@ ene are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; programs to visu@@ alize graph@@ ene . the programs that outdated &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; graphic viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; programme .
&amp; graphic viewer : is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graphic viewers ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; displays in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; K@@ ate ; graphs are re@@ calculated and in &amp; graphic inter@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; K@@ ate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in one &amp; K@@ ate ; component to open
loading of big graphs ( currently there are problems starting about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to represent more than this k@@ not )
further required software : &amp; K@@ graphical viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graphic ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs are required in detail :
&quot; the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; without an argument , the main window will only open the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot , the main window looks like in the lower scre@@ enshot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Grap@@ h is larger than the character surface . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; mouse rad use ( high and down without special , left and right at pressing &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum ampli@@ fication of a graph .
if the currently in &amp; graphic inter@@ viewers ; loaded file from another program the following window will be displayed :
&quot; you can choose whether the Grap@@ h should be re @-@ loaded or if you want to change the change , so you can change your decision later , so you can change your decision later , you can use the menu item c@@ ann@@ viewers ; then , see also . &quot;
&quot; when you open a Graphi@@ end@@ setting out of an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; an instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; one instance or want to represent the char@@ geable graph@@ ite in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the furniture dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the program start , you can let all graphs of your last session open again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the Grap@@ h should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages may be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which are to be placed on a page , the page ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the particular parts of the graph . &quot;
Sitemap with one to several pages distributed graph without head@@ line and with another font .
&quot; the page again shop gives the possibility to set the behavior when a file has changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charging or ignore the changes ) or the program each time . &quot;
&quot; the page Open gives the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; graphic viewer , when a graph open outside a current session . you can set a standard behavior for this case ( the graphs in a new window ) or determine that each time is asked . &quot;
the site administration system gives the possibility to set the start behavior of &amp; graphic viewers . you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session open or not ) or determine to be asked at any start afterwards .
&quot; the context menu , which normally appears on a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; it opens up additional possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; graphical ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries on how they are described on the website of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z are :
&quot; s &amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for targeted graph@@ ers . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of directed graph@@ ene . the algorithm defines the edges in the same direction ( from top to right ) and then try to produce as short edges and as few c@@ utt@@ ings as possible . &quot;
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for universal graph . it produces depic@@ tions according to the spr@@ ing@@ ed graph . it is used by the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai algorithm that is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimension@@ ing sc@@ aling .
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ ed graph , a jumping @-@ spr@@ ing@@ model layout . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ speed sol@@ vers for the treatment of large and pri@@ c@@ clu@@ stered graphs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm calcul@@ ates the knot@@ s circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ stri@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which then will be executed by a shell and the calculated layout of the graph according to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format can be done , or modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ ous ) and uses the default algorithms for the respective type ( dot ; for targeted , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ ous graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview is displayed , provided that this is necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; displays the What is the -@@ mouse cursor . click with this mouse @-@ cursor to a &amp; GUI ; element , to get more assistance to this element ( if available ) . &quot;
a list of changes is available at this address and in the chec@@ ker file at the source level of the source archive .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewers ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it requires the following programs :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; graphic viewer ; in the menu settings you will find more options .
&quot; the main window of the icon factor is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the bar box for string tools , the status bar , the .@@ colour palette , and the grid network in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; if the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog , in which you can choose if the symbol is created from a template , or whether you would like to start anew . &quot;
&quot; put the last revers@@ ed step back . if you have not made a step back@@ wards , this function is disabled . &quot;
adds the content of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gra@@ y@@ scale . this can produce colors that do not coinci@@ de with those of the icon @-@ range of &amp; k@@ de ;
&quot; does not change the symbol , but puts the current character color on the color of the point where you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current promotions . from left to right , it shows you the X@@ - and y coordinates of the current pixel , the magni@@ fier factor , and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
adds the content of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and symbols . &quot;

&quot; select Transpar@@ ent pixels to insert or lin@@ e@@ ale : or add one ch@@ ess@@ board as a transpar@@ ence display . you can also set for the ch@@ ess@@ board the size : the car@@ os on Klein , means and wholesale as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module images read provides tools available to read new pictures and fl@@ atter@@ ing them .
&quot; this module can be used to read new pictures of external sources and fl@@ atter@@ ing . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
pictures scan : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures of a scanner which is supported by the SA@@ NE project or another source like e.g. video Stre@@ ams . so that this works you have to install K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE .
&quot; when you scan the pictures menu , a dialog window you can choose between all available sources on your computer . choose the source you want to pick up the picture here . you can also set the standard source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by selecting the default values duc@@ tions in order to select your image according to the button . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , lower corner . you can find more information in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual . &quot;
&quot; be sure that the window will be completely displayed , as some settings might not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the button scanning , you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the image file . please note that type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore very large files created . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 . &quot;
screen photos can be found after you selected in the menu impor@@ ters &gt; scre@@ enshot . a window appears in which you can adjust the different Screen Sa@@ om@@ o@@ di :
&quot; select The complete desktop , to read a single window under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if all own program window is selected , the call @-@ up program will disappear , so that you can read other screens and windows . otherwise , you will be read after a short delay , the currently visible work@@ space . if you choose the complete desktop folder , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long the scre@@ enshot will be waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ space , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; once the scre@@ enshot was made , the dialog options of the Target @-@ picture with the options described above . &quot;

Flickr is a online photo wal@@ ker on the internet . with Flickr it is possible to send the photos to the people who are important . you can show your favourite photos of the world to show the photos of your camera &apos;s online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the export of exports to Flickr can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet .
&quot; when you use the module for first time , you will be guided through the process of gener@@ alization of a Tok@@ ens . so it is used for your authentication . so it is a browser running , so that you can register with Flickr . &quot;
&quot; after the successful login , the module can send photos to the Flickr web page . the following page will be presented to you after a successful login . &quot;
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pushed to Yes you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr . this will be shown in the next section .
&quot; when the module expor@@ ters are run to Flickr for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialogue , which indicates the current access assignment . the module currently does not support other per@@ missions . you will also be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
the button photos should add once again after you have set all the other options . with this kno@@ w@@ box you can select the photos you want to upload . if you press on the O@@ k button the up@@ loading of the photos to the Flickr server .
the keywords field can be filled with one through comm@@ a separate list of words . these are added to the image as tags during the up@@ loading .
&quot; with the options openings , friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can adjust the access to your images . by default , the photos are classified as a private . &quot;
&quot; when you choose the option to upload the size of the photos before the high@@ load , the photos before up@@ loading in size will be changed . the size is taken from the value at maximal size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of images . the size is changed so the aspect ratio is constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery @-@ Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery Export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alisation allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the met@@ adata of an image , and the loc@@ alization can be stored in the EX@@ IF sampling of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alisation makes tools available to visu@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spherical coordination system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tudes are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML @-@ file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ For@@ mat@@ . g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu on . the top to visual dialog appears . of course , this file contains of course data that were recorded at the same time at the same time as the images of your camera . &quot;
if the file load is loaded a automatic correlation performed the coordinates in red . GPS sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera system must be converted with the GMT . this can be done with time zone . place your camera zone .
&quot; the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a high devi@@ ation for the GPS time and cam@@ az@@ eit . lies the devi@@ ation among them , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you do not have sp@@ ur@@ red data from one place for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add pictures to the pictures . the difference between 2000 seconds then will cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ing and difference within minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ating is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can put these limits here and then push the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialogue will use the coordinates of a call to the next place , you just need to use the button OK to put the data at the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ ating can also be found with the shown map and be found and set . select this again and again through , until you have reached a wide accuracy . the card can always be manually selected between maps , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script using the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module images image is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 , to enable the best internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the module has four horse@@ men in which the settings can be adjusted . you only need to select these albums . you &apos;ll need to select these albums . you &apos;ll be able to select a large number of albums on the right , and the text is displayed in the head of the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely un@@ explained . if you click on an image , a new page is displayed in the image below . otherwise , the image will appear directly with your default image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed &quot;
&quot; the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your images . select a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ f@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , EX@@ IF @-@ Information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color @-@ depth , you can change the standard color @-@ depth . of course the file size also influences the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the rider &apos;s thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album rider for the thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a gradual window displays the user how far the action is . press abor@@ ting to break the process .
&quot; when the module created the pages , the window will not automatically closed . you can therefore start the program@@ ing , to determine if errors are performed during production . the web browser is automatically started to view the preview of the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to view the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Bild@@ ator is a very fast and flexible OpenGL interface to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I ima@@ gery allows it to watch a selection of pictures and run on them basic oper@@ ations such as screen@@ ings , zo@@ oming or reloc@@ ating . the viewer is easy to use and quick access to its functions . &quot;
after the start a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG losses free module is a tool to change pictures without imp@@ airing your quality .
&quot; this module allows for the actions listed below , to save pictures in the JP@@ EG format , without the usual loss of quality or met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the loss of loss is it that the file size is rising , as no compression of color is taking place . this can be found for example with the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool so that you can connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client still does not have documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata module currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import -@@ function of the met@@ adata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image below and then call the import function to which you want to copy the target image . the data is copied after you have pushed the met@@ adata on the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all images formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please check ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG code module is a tool to convert a range of images to a MPEG video in the form of a di@@ asch@@ au .
&quot; the module MPEG code can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , using a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add a audio file in MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the slides . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards you can start using ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images you select will then be listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the selection of images or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pre @-@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds that displays a picture . the speed of the image is specified below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrary to something very smooth . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set up next . in doubt , you should set it black . the name and the path of the created file you can specify the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep it as possible as possible . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under name of the audio file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your preferences . depending on the speed of your computer you can get a cup of coffee and enjoy the di@@ asch@@ au , when you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ zer or tools are missing , so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages on the right button at the bottom . &quot;
the pressure assistant allows you to print several pictures on a sheet paper along with standard Photo@@ sizes . the combined pictures can also be automatically opened with image processing Gimp . this is e.g. useful to enhance you or with the Gimp module to print a direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your stored in one of three formats JP@@ EG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original description of Him is : do not expect the same results , as the software from your camera . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w . &quot;
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ Bild@@ kon@@ verter window will then be displayed in the mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
&quot; you can now optimize the values new to optimize the con@@ versions process . the primary option will decide whether the camera settings can be used for the white waste . if the result is not optimal , you can move the picture later on . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G Con@@ version can be selected to allow you to use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the output result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains equal and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , reserve all the information of your image and uses the loss of free L@@ Z@@ W compres@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for your pictures frequently to process or you later otherwise use the JP@@ EG format , since there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the picture quality is deterior@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JP@@ EG as a storage format , the met@@ adata contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the EX@@ IF data . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start with the output button the conversion . if you want to cancel this process , then you can break down . &quot;
&quot; the st@@ acker processing mode allows you to convert various images to once . therefore , use this mode for example if you are sure , for example testing by using a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the settings available are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to re@@ write this file automatically . however , this is not available in a previous attempt . a preview is not available . however , the progress beam shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start @-@ up and tim@@ est@@ amp of which should be used . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce the image or enlarge the image :
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the picture is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not dis@@ proportionate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; printing preparation : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target image , including background size , edge and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images to your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the checked images in advance . further pictures can take on the list of images to be drawn and disc@@ ard there .
&quot; after you have started the module , the images shown below will be displayed in selected images . over the button images you can add additional images to the button . for the last selected image a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and to add it to you to add the list of related images .
with the button images remove the selected images from the list of related images .
&quot; after you selected all pictures , you can open the new message -@@ window of your e @-@ mail with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and the subject area . you have to use the pictures selected for you as app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of the appropriate e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ Mail@@ Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after the choice of comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are attached to a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the loss of photo files such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality is not changed . otherwise , we recommend the JP@@ EG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JP@@ EG under images file format and are the original files in the JP@@ EG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data are added to the relevant images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is done , the window will not be automatically closed so you can view the status messages , looking for errors , look at the button . your e @-@ mail program is automatically started at the end . with the button Cl@@ ose , you can switch this window ? &quot;
&quot; after starting the module of advanced di@@ asch@@ au , a window appears with questions like you have shown your di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between you selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in presentation are enabled by means of an elegant image via OpenGL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , since otherwise the slides can be very slow . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ame option is displayed , that the data file displayed in the lower left corner during presentation will be displayed . &quot;
the option loop ensures that the presentation will appear in an end loop . you can then manually break it with Es@@ c .
the option pictures to be selected ensures that the images are shown in a random order . so it won &apos;t be the order of the pictures in the album .
&quot; under delay between images can be set at the time distance between the images . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and your selected transition effect . so you should show this before you show the presentation your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can select . random@@ ly sel@@ ects any transition between the images a different effect .
&quot; during the di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slides . &quot;
&quot; on the left bottom of the screen , you can view the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; currently , K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date j@@ us@@ hed has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to put an image as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module is the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as the background for your K@@ DE work surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse through this browser , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , are now available in each group , i.e. in people , places and within group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you can see the categories , for which you have entered information as to look at your images and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based informations , see the folder structure on your hard drive and of course to look at the current thumb@@ nails . in the following each one is described for themselves . &quot;
&quot; if you are pressing the mouse on the entry person , the view of the browser is changing . see picture . &quot;
if you select a further person only the images are shown on which both people are visible . through this selection method you can limit the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures on a few individual pictures .
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can see with thumb@@ nails to view the images of your range . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can store your own thumb@@ nail , which is of course also true for places , keywords and other categories you have defined . see this picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images in addition to the name , select the button that you want to use right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category at the same time . this has the advantage that you can see for example symbols with pictures of people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not have appropriate images ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to decide which image should be displayed for each individual person . here , you need to select the picture editor , as shown in the picture . here , you can customize the image for the corresponding person . in the check @-@ window you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and thereby choose which part of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you access the main window entry , a dialog is displayed , which is very similar to the dialog for the fixed picture properties . this dialog can be viewed on the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the box or description , the cap@@ tures and descriptions of the pictures are searching for this text . if you like , you can also be a date to search for example in 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here is by pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manuals but prefer to try out more features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and check out the speed@@ boat , the screen@@ caps and quotes . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; cold album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , in case you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help menu entry on photo@@ album ; then you &apos;ll be able to load some example images and you can test the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print out this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , take a look at the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar is seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each track then shows a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by pointing only 10 @-@ minutes sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be inter@@ actively using the following ways : you can select the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the tim@@ eline is always shown at the current date of the moment displayed in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by keeping the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ est@@ amps , so if you choose one area , you will view images of this time@@ frame . you can ab@@ ort the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; on the following part of the user guide , one is integrated into &amp; photo@@ sets ; one is integrated into &amp; photo@@ sets ; integrated version described in &amp; photo@@ photo@@ sets ; integrated version described in the menu file to create ... &quot;
&quot; before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following each area is described more precisely . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the Over@@ view and a description that is to contain the HTML file later . on the photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; cold album ; export file should be created on the review page . nutritional information about export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed without a description . for example , that all pictures from a party are evident . for example , that all pictures are exported from a party . you can therefore not use this option to hide certain images from certain views . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why this is not specifically given . &quot;
&quot; bottom of the page you can set up various resolutions for the images . therefore , those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images to download , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the spect@@ ator of your site can change the resolution at any time . so , he can search your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he wants to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting area , you place the different folder and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best to select all your HTML files , select a base folder and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you must select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and select for the next time automatically . you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE @-@ supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can verify that this really is visible to viewers . if you want to select a URL for the base folder , after the pages you choose , this folder should be created . otherwise , the web browser should start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to copy them manually . thus , the import function , see , correct , you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folders of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the currently described settings are related all three to basic folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ sets ; however , you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . of course , you may want to wear a HTML page for viewing the pictures , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , then do not even have to do this work . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; cold album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others to your database . the image properties are combined with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file or if the file is just a short@@ cut to the file that you can share all images and that file is so independent . however , the obvious downside is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML @-@ pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images on a two @-@ time way . first , the images found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file will be found . of course , the images of the URL you have indicated when creating HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML @-@ Export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for the export of images can be ex@@ porting , which you can export across the menu File ... go to the menu . &quot;
the main option of this dialogue is whether it is to act by internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; if manual is inserted into the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ in file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Autom@@ atically in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; paste album ; the pictures automatically for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . as most of the pictures are already compressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small and it is usually not profitable to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress this you simply select the export file .
&quot; the last option of this page is the maximum image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can say the size by giving for example , that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser , or from the menu file , select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for imports is made up of four steps . first , you have to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import pictures are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are the category individuals of the imported file person@@ er ( if you are a dump ) , while this category is required in your database persons . therefore , you are to be imported in the third dialog window which are to be imported in the third dialog window , which categories which are imported to the imported file and which categories these are in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can specify the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example for this can be seen on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse pictures and watch : if you look at images , you often want to view images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this hand@@ book you will pass the various steps from ( 1 ) section of the information about your pictures , over ( 2 ) to look through ( 2 ) advanced topics and adap@@ tability . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program for the administrator of your pictures . but it has been extended and today , it will also take care of your videos . in many places in this manual there will be about pictures , but frequently , this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ genic album ; stores all his information in the inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of her images . this is a simple XML file , which you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or revisions on CVS , where they like . &quot;
&quot; check out the folder in which your images are stored and used automatically . if you want to read another folder tree with pictures , you can launch a different folder tree with pictures , you can launch a different folder ; using the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; on the menu entry settings of photo@@ sets ; set up a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user guide you will be explained the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call the setting options of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting you can call an extensive help to the F1 button and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; in has been described as you can define different properties , e.g. individuals , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; you can see the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for each available group you can select a description and one symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options you can set complete members groups , i.e. all members of a group set up once in a group instead of explaining all groups of a member state . &quot;
&quot; in view of the settings that are available to you for the setting of the members , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window there is a list of the current categories and in the right list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module system with other graphic applications such as the K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . nutrient information for this can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be called through the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , but most modules also own a Help page that you can access through the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; as the modules are used together with one another one another , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo database can always be tested using the command line using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album - demo &lt; or input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not tell me , I would not have warned ! &quot;
&quot; applications that use the modules on K@@ IP@@ I together are very different , which allows it to be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ sets ; do not work . this is the draw@@ back when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ sets ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are using their pictures in albums : this kind of order is not supported , simul@@ ates it for some modules the order to albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; thereby , simul@@ ated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the images that you look at the picture look at the moment . &quot;
&quot; besides the current album , you need to pass a few albums ; the modules also pass a list of albums . here is a photo@@ album , as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will have the category that you have specified in the dialog dialog as category for virtual albums . for example , if you would like to use the category individuals , so whether you have selected persons and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; as some modules with &amp; photo@@ genic album ; not compatible are you can remove them from the list of modules . start the dialog dialog , and select the modules that modules are to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you can see an example of a starting screen , as soon as you start your photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , take a look at the top of a menu and tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar you can see the window with which you can browse your image database . in the section we will see you again on this window , now click on this window to show you an overview with all the available images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ sets ; is the possibility to view every picture with notes , where the picture was taken , etc. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures certain notes at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures in Copenhagen were recorded . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for seeking and browsing , as you can read in section . if you want to see these notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists with a text box by using individuals , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ album ; because you will always use it again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is the moving of images inside the list : if you have a family celebration and are listed on all 50 pictures of the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , so you can find the names used upwards to find and assign the people faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to have a alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting after date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each photo individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and provide these pictures with notes . simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located right at the top of the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded several pictures , e.g. by the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item multiple entries at one time with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . besides , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window which shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the di@@ alogs , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also make an entry into a category and disc@@ ard it to sort this to a sub@@ category of this entry . please note that you just see your categories alphabe@@ tically . see it for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the di@@ amonds by clicking the edge , which form the edge of the frame , click and post@@ p@@ one . you can also make a separate window by using it outside the window . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which gives you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also get a frame completely out . if you want to see this window again later , use the button options ... and click here a window . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ paintings of the currently selected images , or all pictures in case you have no filter . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply clicking the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simple times . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background picture for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; if you click on an image , this picture is displayed in the picture . if you have not opened a window with a picture of image , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the image show . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete , or select either the removal button or select in the Edit menu option . now , you see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; for this problem , you can have a solution for this problem . you can also use the pictures to be stored on your hard disk . of course , you need to have the images stored anywhere , so you can download the pictures anywhere . in the picture you see the view of &amp; photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard drive . this is available for example in pictures 1 @-@ 9 , however , for pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails can be displayed . however , you can also view these pictures with the picture . &quot;
&quot; as you can see this function you need to copy files from the folders and re @-@ copy . &amp; cold album , now it does not support you to avoid the inser@@ ting of the CD . if you would like to avoid anger how to avoid the mess of your images , please buy a larger disk in order to save all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want a little more privacy , please filter the images that you want to see for others in@@ accessible and click on the Up@@ dating view to unlock your little sister , ta@@ xed and the menu entry all out of present view . &quot;
&quot; thus , you set out which images are going to be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to block the laptop now your little sister , allowing all images that you have blocked , hidden . if you want to see the pictures again , click lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that has to be entered to un@@ locking the pictures . to set up this password , simply select password changes in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; remember that this image protection is under no circumstances very safe . for one can read all pictures on the hard disk and to the other , anyone who can read the password as un@@ encrypted text , or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text ; not very familiar to rep@@ el the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can manage all your pictures with &amp; cold album ; manage and describe lessons for hours with it , of course , that you want to look at it at some point . for this reason , &amp; photo@@ album . this is why you can preview them from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can be seen in the viewer . of course it shows the image , but additional all the information you have to enter into the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can use it with mouse and disc@@ ard it . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed on the viewer . you can see all these options below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here , see the appropriate entries on this display . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene chosen . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and jump down by using the buttons image high and image . you can get to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these features are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; cold album , then loads a new picture after a few seconds . how often there &apos;s a new image can be controlled by pressing the string button and plus or minus . now and stopped the di@@ asch@@ au by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
a very useful skill of the be@@ holder of &amp; k@@ photo@@ sets ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can move into the image and pull out zo@@ oming . on the button @-@ button you can easily rec@@ r@@ zo@@ oming the plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not shown zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ ator places the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel is in the screen a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work in videos that are in and pulled off with the plus .
&quot; with the turn@@ tables from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu item note from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures it may happen , you will find a picture with a person whose names you have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can view the view and configuration dialog of the picture in order to highlight these names , but you will perhaps prefer to view the image and look at more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer in order to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and see them as good or bad while looking at one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with features while you view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you press the appropriate letters . in view a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set the features on your images , these are available in your browser . so you can use all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use one module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you view categories in D@@ re preview view , then you can press features to the images by simply squee@@ ze the letters for the characteristic having the picture selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image . for this case you allow you to paint your photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
&quot; the mixture is not stored on the image , but in the database . on the way you can re@@ vert your painted later . &quot;
in case you can see a picture on the painted . to turn on the pictures from the context menu . to put on the picture from the context menu . to finish the list simply put the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you have to control the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation about &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties tab and the object in the wire @-@ mod@@ ell@@ ular views are shown yellow . &quot;
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object as all sub@@ object are already selected with the object .
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select menu item in the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; if there are multi@@ e possible positions , the following folding @-@ menu appears in order that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , under Edit or from the context menu , you can delete selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click on to apply these changes . if you entered invali@@ d values , a message will be displayed with a error description . then you can correct the input error corrected , or change the changes with cras@@ hes . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation in the furnishing dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the indicated object by means of help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to be able to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 includes the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview your preview . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the peculi@@ arity view and a small example of the scene is hin@@ dered with the selected texture , even if you want to have selected the whole texture ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally . &quot;
the scre@@ enshot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through pulling with your mouse within the whole window . &quot;
&quot; every object has a Visi@@ bility model as a wire level . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility of the higher @-@ level object , or as absolute value . objects are then displayed only if they are selected or their visibility of visibility to be smaller , or equal in the tool@@ bar of the scene . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window @-@ order as default . the object tree and the view of the properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard shut@@ ters , or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust them to any number . you can also save multiple shut@@ ters and switch between different assignments . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under a present view , drag the beginning to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views on top of each other , drag the beginning in the middle of a different view . you can then change between the views by clicking on the car@@ card label above in the views . &quot;
&quot; the latest possible shut@@ ters are float @-@ views : views that are not entr@@ en@@ ched in the main window . to solve a view from the anchor , drag the beginning to the desktop or click on the small to the top right of the button . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the auction bar . to prevent the shot , click the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu View you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are ho@@ vering , you can anchor it to any point . &quot;
&quot; the current window view can save you with view window disorder ... save . it will display a dialog , where you can save the shut@@ ters under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; when you created a scene , you can ren@@ ders them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ ders , this program must be properly installed . as this manual is written , was &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ders the current scene , click on the icon rendering the icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu view scene . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the size and quality of the rendering . if you want to insert a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of top modes , from a quick preview of up to full models in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View Samples , select the following dialog : &quot;
&quot; every batch mode has a name . you can enter any name , it makes sense , however , a name which makes the mode of mode easy . &quot;
&quot; in the car@@ dium size , you can enter the width and height of the framed picture . if you want to use only one small area of the image , select the check @-@ area sub@@ section and give the image section to ren@@ ders into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the combination field quality , you can select the properties that use &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this goes from a very simple color and lighting model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual for &amp; Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if a picture with only one ray depending on pixel rate , there can be different bugs . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or fl@@ atter@@ ing effect in curves and lines , sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
Pov@@ ray uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally speaking pictures with this property are better off .
&quot; when you turn off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard , an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because every pixels is continually expanded again and adap@@ tive because every pixels depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam per pixel . if the difference between the colours to the neigh@@ b@@ oured pixel rate , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the lowering value at 4 , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated , with a lowering of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays depending on pixels . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays depending on the pixels . if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre @-@ determined threshold , then the pixels is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that can be followed separately and can be checked for further under@@ distribution . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the lowering value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of smokers for the beam process , called j@@ it@@ tering . if you turn j@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for the quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental characteristic of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this mapping you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the related rays do not have an object .
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray issue . if &amp; Pov@@ ray &#93; is finished , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu item imports ... and choose a file in the dialogue window . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not the complete command @-@ catch of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if during imports , messages or warnings occur , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can draw objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this adds to the source text of the object in the opened text file in the editor . just highlight the source text in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
&quot; with copying and inser@@ tion in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; likewise . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene is ren@@ amed . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; click on help in the self @-@ view view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation on the indicated object . place here the path to your document tion and version . supported the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example altitude sul@@ ph@@ ate ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also fill the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used . &quot;
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the colour for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type characteristic .
&quot; you can adjust the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire @-@ model views . you can set the grid separately for shifting , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the indicated objects , but require more time for ren@@ der@@ ings . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detailed stage for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended proj@@ ections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided , if the camera uses an extended projection . more advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions of perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this property results in a better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to rendering . &quot;
&quot; if you want to display wall wall , a wall is hidden behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess column pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you display soil , a soil below the objects is cut off . the floor is shown in a chess column pattern from two single @-@ adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you activate the channel , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more precise information about the parameters you can find in section R@@ ender modes . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can modify existing shut@@ ters or create new shut@@ ters . in paragraph shut@@ ters will be explained how to create and store windows . &quot;
the combination of standard window @-@ window @-@ order : displays all existing shut@@ ters . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window order when starting the program .
&quot; the list of existing shut@@ ters shows all existing shut@@ ters . a new order can be created with the button &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; and to delete a selected order with the button . &quot;
any window disorder is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name indicates all views of the chosen window order . new views can be created with the button Add and delete selected views with the button .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with discomfort map , you get a car@@ piece of view together with the previous view and web@@ based view not anchored in the main window , but creates a drunk window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just installed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to follow more exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere at one level . &quot;
&quot; however , you should carefully consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you get as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to the rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; when you make no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get just a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have everything faul@@ ty installed , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre @-@ assembled windows order : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can expect an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then select the menu option to delete . hence , you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice the scene from the view of the camera . this is the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of view lenses in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentary about &amp; Pov@@ ray ; find out more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is subsequent instructions , but note that you can change the camera in the view points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a check@@ points and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you apply the button or press the input button , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could add a Qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a simple method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; it is actually a simpler opportunity . you can use an infinite plane as a ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then push the button , or insert the input button . in the object tree , the new name will immediately be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now shows the level , even though at the moment only as a limited degree level . when you ren@@ ders the scene , the plane stretches up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you look exactly the object tree , you will find that you can see the entry for the ground if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the item Properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should shift the ground to exercise a unity among the horizon line , so you can get to know some of these parameters . select a shift and set the values as below : &quot;
&quot; first , select the bottom to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialog , where you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select the object displayed in the object tree . you can see the name in the property view . you can preview the name in the property view , like the pig@@ ment now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of pig@@ ments shows only a black black material because you can still need settings for the pig@@ ment yet . therefore , you always remember the colors for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities for this , but you now take the easiest way . &quot;
&quot; if you do not see a color on Qu@@ ader and ball in the preview , click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is right now . if you watch your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following results : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color that you expected . here you have to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also edit this entry twice ( you can do so also more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
choose in the object tree jed@@ es@@ mal @-@ big and change the colors in the view of the lens properties :
you should already be able to run this step as you should have understood the basic functioning of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; it is already understood . the ball is just as easy as the floor can create :
&quot; in the view of the Properties icons , you can immediately modify the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to put the ball in touch with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the floor , since you have shifted the soil to down one unit down@@ ward . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering now returns a strange result : as already seen before , the ball surface looks like a black black material . sit in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; select accommodation object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click on the sphere of pig@@ ment , then select one @-@ part and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; however , you can reach interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values like in the following scre@@ ams and click to apply or push the input button .
&quot; the settings gl@@ oss effect and reflection yiel@@ ded partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces even if metallic : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully , you have already learnt so much that you can easily create , but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tracing is a R@@ ender @-@ method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts , the rendering hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera , which reflects the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects are effects such as fog . thus , the scene pixels is processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you look at the scene . without a light source you see also nothing , the image is simple black . obviously , each scene needs to be lo@@ oted , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
open a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you have created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
&quot; whenever you open a new model or create , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaced it with the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already stored the model , it is stored under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and space . &quot;
&quot; displays the scene in the last recorded version , all changes since the last storage will be ki@@ cked . &quot;
you can only select this menu option if you have not saved any changes in the scene .
&quot; repeated the last revers@@ ed command . you can only select this menu option , if you have used editing . &quot;
&quot; saves the current window order and opens a dialog , in which you can enter a name for a new order or write an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; , here you can change the look , the keyboard short@@ cut and the standard . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can edit or add new commands using this option ; commands may change or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove using this option tool@@ icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands and remove commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to pre@@ dict smo@@ other finishes without any b@@ ump on the surface individually mod@@ eled and without change the geom@@ etrical form of the object itself .
&quot; it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a batch map , as well as for a texture map . &quot;
basic bodies are simple geom@@ etric shapes that you can use as gem@@ s : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed to give them a realistic appearance .
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base , using a picture @-@ file as a color card . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image browser , where you can select images for viewing . &quot;
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
&quot; the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files , which you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button return . &quot;
&quot; you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images are always to use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , simply tap the first character of the file in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a suitable fil@@ en@@ ame will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pil@@ ates of return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in dialogue setting - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five different cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up in the two others , short @-@ command for the display window and short @-@ command for the browser , you can set the short@@ cuts for each panel . &quot;
&quot; if the image is selected in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color that you can further down . default is not full@@ screen mode . &quot;
&quot; if this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you are still looking at the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for sli@@ deshow . &quot;
&quot; with this option stores &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , which opens the name of the most recently opened folder . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode , the window is bigger than the picture , also here the background with the selected color is filled . &quot;
&quot; you can set up &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so set , that only some of the file types can be displayed , which the program can also be present . &quot;
with this option the display window will be extended to the full screen . this option is switched as default .

&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; makes it possible to report as easy as possible errors or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu includes an entry to reports of problems or wishes . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser opens a page for reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . in this mailing list , however , we would like to answer any other users of &amp; show@@ photo . in this mailing list , however , you would be spoken in English , you should therefore be powerful this language . &quot;
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; it is the developer mailing list to step forward . guide to join the developers mailing list from &amp; show@@ photo ;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo : to give you so much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that access the behavior of the show@@ rooms . to set up on these settings , you need to switch to these settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub @-@ or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . de@@ x@@ ter@@ ous should display a bright color and over@@ exposure to a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides you with important information and promotions to the selected images . you can view these advertisements in which you click on one of the five horse@@ men : &quot;
&quot; &amp; sk@@ ating ; is an application to scan images , which no longer makes images to scan and fl@@ atter . &quot;
&quot; &amp; sk@@ ating ; is a simple application to scan images , which no longer makes images to scan and play . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can save for each image a dialog to save or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images from the store . &quot;
you can check the status of support of your scanner at the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a default scanner can be set on the command line from &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to choose the scanner is opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner and push OK to open the scanner . break off is termin@@ ated .
the further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane ) do not treat these options especially .
&quot; to check an image , the user can only start a pre @-@ slip and then start scanning for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
to select the image better the user can get into the image and out of the current selection out zo@@ oming . he can also set the zoom so that the complete preview fits the window .
if the picture has been selected then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
&quot; if before storing a preview display in settings is displayed , then the image is displayed in a pre @-@ window window as below is displayed . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and sound ? en leads to a break and you get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; by the button settings , the ep@@ onymous dialog is open in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , in front of saving . in this case , the option must be chosen before storing a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be chosen . &quot;
&quot; this option allows them to select the type such as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images to pick up . dialog to save each image opens the dialog before each saved picture . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically generated with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must choose to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images stored at the option Save without following a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as standard for dialogue to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the image to be mem@@ orized , and it is also the proposed name for the image in dialogue to save . the automatically saved picture gets a numer@@ ical su@@ ff@@ ix of each time is stored if a picture is stored . the string # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
&quot; the user can adjust to saving image quality . this value also changes the compression value in store . when choosing the picture quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; sk@@ in@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button Over starts the K@@ DE About -@@ dialogue for &amp; sk@@ ating ; the button settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ ating .

&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below , you can set up a list of these cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cut can set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select the buttons below ... selecting the right mouse button in the player window and select short @-@ command . &quot;
&quot; you may possibly set existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short @-@ command , so make your keyboard on &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control centre . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ COP @-@ interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that can mostly also be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of Collection , context @-@ browser , Player , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , playlist browsers and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Amar@@ o@@ ok has some own command @-@ lines options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a missing dependency . please check in your script , if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so that the user ID is not running . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder Scrip@@ ts / templates you will find a lot of template @-@ scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts , or they can easily expand to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ COP can control your scripts with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow exclusion of external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called rather straightforward . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; send messages to all ongoing scripts . for this reason , strings to the standard release of the script . for this reason , scrip@@ ting should monitor their standard automatically and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events though it has no use for it . &quot;
configure We@@ is the script to view the setup dialog . to save the store and loading of the furnishings must take care of each script yourself . if a script is started it sets Amar@@ o@@ ok the work@@ ing@@ folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
&quot; tr@@ ack@@ change signal that a new piece will be played . the script might be played for example , with D@@ COP functions to further information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the denom@@ ination ) . &quot;
volum@@ e@@ change new@@ volume sign@@ aled a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ n Cli@@ cked : subtle menu , un@@ veil the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu option is clicked . to add an entry to the menu , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; finished , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed in order to work for example . for example , the store of data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages , which the user can download &amp; eg ; downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which allows the user to recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok @-@ script package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 is accepting only script packages with the Exten@@ sion amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right away . &quot;
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) to the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameters to obtain the file rights :
&quot; when your script is ready , you can download it at www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and take the link to the Wi@@ ki Skri@@ ll side of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; attached to your entry to k@@ de @-@ apps . you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly simple to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you will find only a very specific title of thousands of you in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collecting browsers and the quick search will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have already some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly right for you . and if the decision is still hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used , allowing you to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , you have to enter the bottom @-@ level sub@@ folder of the Amar@@ ok @-@ sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf@@ ection@@ ist and autom@@ ake used , you should be able to compile no difficulties . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing list . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok , like most applications , has a number of options that can be activated or disable for comp@@ iling time with the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iler options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . details of this can be found in the system requirements . &quot;
&quot; enabled de@@ bug fixes . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full use . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without any trouble on the furniture dialog . the furniture dialog has several post@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
&quot; player windows show up the player window in addition to the playlist , or off . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists &quot; &quot; J@@ K &quot; &quot; tab is displayed . &quot;
&quot; voting bar@@ ometer : this feature is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option makes the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer . &quot;
atmospheric design : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this makes the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
&quot; to drop the voting files in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise , the .@@ -@@ files stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / min / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser should start from &amp; Amar@@ ok , when a browser is needed . &quot;
use other browser : here you can specify the path to a different browser which is not in the list .
&quot; to save on the playlist , the current playlist automatically saves on the Be@@ enden of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; go to this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist upon receipt . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is saved . &quot;
&quot; the current piece appear to be visible in the piece of piece , that the play@@ lists tro@@ ut up , to keep the current piece always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing the context @-@ browser , the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
in the appearance picture you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is in three parts sub@@ section .
&quot; in the fonts section you can use the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . you can use scripts for the following area : play@@ lists window , player windows and context browser . press on choosing ... , so you can choose a type font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of custom color scheme , you yourself have the tor@@ ment of choice and can specify a private color scheme . use the same color selection for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; continue to continue playing at the start , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start playing automatically with the piece at the place , with which they stopped at the last ending . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to switch the OS@@ D . when on @-@ screen display , a preview of the OS@@ D is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
&quot; the first option is the font . click &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; to select from the dialog the desired font for the OS@@ D . the cross@@ box shadows causes the text in the OS@@ D sh@@ aded . &quot;
&quot; use their own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the OS@@ D colors for writing and background . one click on the color surfaces opens the dialog to paint selection . if self @-@ colour colours are not enabled , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de ; colours are used . &quot;
&quot; the display field displays the text shown in the OS@@ D . by entering plac@@ ements , the OS@@ D can be adapted to your own needs . below , you will find a list of available Plac@@ eholder and what they mean . &quot;
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ fold monitor environment will appear to be OS@@ D .
the Kar@@ tei@@ Card audio output lets you choose an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers still activate additional settings in this mapping card .
the Kar@@ tei@@ Card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to insert a folder in the collection apart from its name . this section also contains An@@ cross fields to insert how to select the selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folders in@@ discrimin@@ ate : this means that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and sub@@ folders as well as their sub@@ folders .
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders added to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , there will be an incre@@ mental search to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; import lists : causes , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found playlist to add to your collection ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; the part of the collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combin@@ atory field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , another institution is needed in the sub@@ window of My@@ S@@ ql institution . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql @-@ institution is used for inser@@ ting the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok . under the machine : the machine is inserted , on which the network is entered , under which the database is available . name : is the database name to which the connection is made . &quot;
use user name : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
&quot; the Kar@@ tei@@ Card P@@ f@@ .@@ f@@ m is aimed at support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok , the names of the played pieces can be delivered to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and to create music recommendations regarding the current piece . &quot;
&quot; here , enter your username and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send the pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to submit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters call : after activation of this attitude becomes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters can be seen at the same distance . you can see the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you need no last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to be able to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and gallery with screen photos .
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ok only requires the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to be written e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide , how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the OS@@ D pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome is thus working , but flu@@ x@@ box will support for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they represent an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably one of your files will make an error in the equ@@ b library . you can see the file fin@@ ely by typing in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Amar@@ ok / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log in . please report the cap@@ ut@@ te file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and generate the collection again . &quot;
&quot; mostly , it is obvious that Tag@@ us cras@@ hes in reading the Met@@ a info from that file . please report this bug to the equ@@ ine developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok is a bit more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if , B. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , then this leads to overthrow the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then turn off machine . switch off if in@@ active for ... into the adjustment of the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically with a crash ) . if it comes to a common down@@ turn , and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that a lot of program can write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info , but it does not mark as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l &quot; &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b@@ - &gt; new ( $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / Dynamic playlist ) see in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the tool@@ ing effects are simply forgotten . this is a well known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can check the status De@@ activ@@ ates on grey and semi @-@ transparent . please note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
if you get this mistake : amar@@ o@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ o@@ app : irregular icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 27@@ m@@ ap@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ o@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos;@@ _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first . &quot;
&quot; there are some possibilities . most installation problems clarify the easiest way through the help of an expert your Uni@@ xes or Linux distribution . you can also search for assistance in other users or with developers . use the Forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok . &quot;
bu@@ g@@ illa is not suitable for help to search . please enter there only one mistake if something is located at the error of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only appears a blank playlist . how do music pieces come here ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to intui@@ tively hold the surface intui@@ tively , the start @-@ window was converted into the Statisti@@ cs window . you can find it under ex@@ tras statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the playlist will be displayed in the playlist and select column review . click anywhere in the new application column , to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short command line Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ o@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press de@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from playlist to remove from the folding menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with your mouse to the playlist , and let them fall , just like you would do it with other files . so simple is that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the add @-@ button , you can save the button playlist . click on it . &quot;
probably missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . take a look at li@@ b@@ r / this package contains a lot of very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations .
&quot; the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . besides , you will find it about the menu bar under ex@@ tras E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used one of the back@@ end independent approach , hence , the real question loud which media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support this pretty much every only audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even scan text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which the pres@@ et does not receive any MP3 dé@@ cor ( for patent legal reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 , &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the radio device driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must provide a mix@@ er . a mix@@ er allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be reached simultaneously audio ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you to search for the problem , and help a solution . for G@@ stretching you may need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ , ) . &quot;
&quot; does this &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first de@@ co@@ ded at al@@ sa , you would just use a white smoke . gin reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend direct to al@@ sa , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the belt drive drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real time limit ) and increase the size of the sound bu@@ ffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set : &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s , which can cause un@@ disturbed playback . read this error report . read this error report . the magnific@@ ation of the sound puzzle file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the fastest Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ .@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use another drivers ( the x@@ ine driver was heavily optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts Pu@@ ffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less income respond to visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cras@@ hes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ? &quot;

thanks D@@ COP is this already possible . place an alarm in your calendar program and leave with the alarm this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
&quot; this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ boot playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok , run before going to bed , then you are awakened by the gentle pots of the music you have stopped in front of the bed . &quot;
how to find the current title in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles can be found when one is connected to another computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the current piece : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ use Amar@@ ok @-@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires that your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA .
&quot; the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window window , press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size modi@@ fiable window . &quot;
the combination of Str@@ g + Right click will provide a piece in the cli@@ ck@@ ling sequence into the queue . by pressing the input box after a search in the playlist the first search results is played and the search is reset .

&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS drive . after starting from Amar@@ ok , the collection database can not be created and on the console many messages appear . what &apos;s now ? &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / min / Amar@@ ok on a local drive or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD one , then click in the menu on audio CD . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders . to be read in the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folders in a Con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic enco@@ ding you take instead of folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;

&quot; basically this fits the previous review with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece has been played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence has every single rating on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can do the evaluation of a piece by clicking on a sp@@ readsheet in the play@@ lists window . there , you can select the evaluation of a piece in the playlist , just like all other attributes , namely by selecting the right mouse button on the piece , and edit the Edit : review , or edit F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the dialog met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the developers do not want to present you when you are to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan , which is not together with the short notice schedule of Amar@@ ok . &quot;

&quot; if you want to use al@@ sa , then use the latest available version . old Al@@ sa versions have caused a lot of cras@@ hes and therefore also a lot of error reports . &quot;
presumably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer installed . therefore the / configure routine did not compile this output modules . you need to configure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new configure and install .
&quot; now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; presumably , use a distribution which is installed the development files separated from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer are installed , the necessary developer files . you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards , you need to compile and install . &quot;
I consider the error of G@@ spreading Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos;@@ ad@@ der &apos;s &apos;s no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ ational , this is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you will have to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without pump . a tip of Merlin @-@ TC : do not compile a L@@ DF@@ L@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .

I have a second sound card and use al@@ sa . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound@@ card ?
&quot; under settings Amar@@ o@@ ok ... audio output , you type the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ Co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ R@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type Plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ R@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter the interior dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of converting the ta@@ str@@ ates , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual @-@ mix device , disable the tick on sound card . &quot;

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o : : this program burns audi@@ o- or data @-@ CD @-@ R@@ s in a flow ( also called disk @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a text description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ iso@@ fs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore , and extends these functions even . therefore , &amp; C@@ 3@@ b ; usually reached &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , higher quality at burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital audio ) . in the Internet such programs are generally called ri@@ pper .
&quot; O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional technology for audio code . O@@ GG requires open source code and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and Encoder modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio de@@ coder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers of Lay@@ er I , Lay@@ er II , and Lay@@ er III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 de@@ coder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 de@@ coder who can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial En@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss of free audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C de@@ coder module and the external audio module module so you can read FLA@@ C files and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Muse@@ pack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for the processing of different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example to de@@ code WMA , then call an audio CD to burning .@@ de@@ co &quot;
&quot; So@@ x : a relief program , which can be done between different audio formats and convert . So@@ x is used by the So@@ x Audio Encoder module . &quot;
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : one in the functional , fully equipped authors &apos; system for editing , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool will be useful to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can be useful for example , for creating ge@@ cut@@ ted CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections . without norm@@ alize , the different absorption of the various albums can lead to the un@@ nice effect that the music pieces can be played differently loud . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically can re@@ play all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
&quot; this is a convenient way to re@@ charge projects recently . the related sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has been recorded once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise after a new file name will be asked . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save under is displayed , with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file . &quot;
&quot; saves all opened projects . this is the same , as if you would call for every single project file Save . &quot;
&quot; the current project . if a project has changed and yet has not been stored , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then cancel between saving and changes . besides , you can cancel the closing and hold the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each project stored , what should be done with it , just as if you were calling for each project file Cl@@ ose . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each not stored project is asked about what is supposed to happen , as if you were calling the file . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can enter the current dialog files to add to the project . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the upper view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added in the base folders of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog &quot; &quot; burning &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the characteristics @-@ dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above what is the ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
&quot; this entry is only published with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it &apos;s useful when you put files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you are not used for a multi @-@ session CD , even if this function is not used for you , so that you can see the files already existing files and folders . &quot;
&quot; this function only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature set up &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project to remove . this function removes no files from the medium , it ends only the previously imported files back . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , without a project file , copying a CD into another medium . alternatively , you can also only use an image of a CD which can then be burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of buying a CD instead of normal copy . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs using broken sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , without a project file , copying the copying of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only use an image of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue . furthermore , there is also the possibility of buying a DVD with the help of copying dialogue will not be big enough to absorb the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; opens the dialog to the form@@ atting of a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing model and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; burns a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then immediately not be supported by pressing the burning Kno@@ pf@@ s . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burns an earlier DVD image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window will be converted . this dialog window will usually be used after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used everywhere . it contains information about the illuminated video , enco@@ ding settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cut @-@ black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the occasional medium . this information is shown in the content view , and include properties of the medium , such as size and titles length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of tool@@ bar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is enabled , a small void is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view switches a or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is activated , the content in the content view is displayed . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and un@@ locking the disk or throw the medium . &quot;
&quot; the view switches a or off . the view allows to select and drag files into the proj@@ ections . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the Cop@@ ac@@ iste is a narro@@ wer area , which contains only visible when the proj@@ ector has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the proj@@ ections clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this will open a dialog window to change the buttons for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after you choose one of the commands in the upper part , you can adjust the short@@ cut order to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; furnishings . this allows the proper per@@ missions to burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administration rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system managers ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here , general programs can be made . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended for person@@ alize and to the intri@@ gue of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many others &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface is equipped . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled by a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can either use the command @-@ line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to the function@@ all@@ usion , so it is more your taste and the type of your requirements is crucial to which the mutual programs you give . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the command line program , you need to make sure you have to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; features that have all &amp; k@@ de ; programs have in common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts which are described below . &quot;
the default D@@ COP interface between &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects . &quot;
D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ B@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ pe D@@ v@@ d ( ) Vo@@ id my D@@ v@@ d ( ) Vo@@ id copy@@ d@@ f ( ) Vo@@ id Vi@@ v@@ d ( ) Vo@@ id Vi@@ v@@ d ( ) Vo@@ id Vi@@ v@@ d ( ) Vo@@ id Vi@@ v@@ d ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) Vo@@ id Vi@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ UR@@ ur@@ l ) Vo@@ id Vi@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X project method one gets a D@@ COP @-@ reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ Ref ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b ) -@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project received by using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b _ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project D@@ urch using this reference , it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the high @-@ performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which is only applicable on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; Vo@@ id cre@@ ate@@ en ( Q@@ string name ) Vo@@ id cre@@ ate@@ en ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) Vo@@ id add@@ ur@@ ls ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) Vo@@ id remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string Run@@ ning ) Vo@@ id Surgery ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string _ name ) Vo@@ id Surgery ( Q@@ string database ) Vo@@ id &quot; Vo@@ id &quot; Vo@@ id &quot; Vo@@ id &quot; Vo@@ id &quot; Vo@@ id &quot; Vo@@ id &quot;
&quot; for example , it is possible to fill up a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ fol@@ d@@ test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ en the fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ ders / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ en / home / tru@@ cking / some@@ fi@@ le@@ .txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; audio CD ; is an audio CD ; -@@ les@@ bian for &amp; k@@ de ; with it , just audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the Encoder which is installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( comp@@ iler ) is the user interface provided by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( comp@@ iler ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( compressed @-@ free compression ) must be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the tracks of the &amp; CD will be read and stored in W@@ AV files on the computer ( los@@ sy and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these W@@ AV files ( usually one per titles ) comp@@ ress into the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or also into other formats like loss @-@ free FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ pre@@ until ( for O@@ GG ) or other co @-@ di@@ ers have already been installed , so it is very likely not necessary to compile something ourselves . however , for example FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is also not necessary . &quot;
which enco@@ ding / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compres@@ sing factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; in any case , it cannot be possible to b@@ aking a protected audio CD ; it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of cop@@ ier protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only needs to be done ( the furniture dialog can be viewed as often as a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understanding the slim approach of user interface , which you often stum@@ ble in the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the Internet , or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is manually recorded . &quot;
this is only a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example there is more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program .
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of inquiry in the tab CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case , first , the connection to the internet must be made . ) &quot;
start reading and - if an en@@ coder is configured in the map settings in the furniture format - the enco@@ ding .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , allowing the selection to be read with another en@@ coder than the standard . it is to be noted that previously the Encoder has been configured in the tab@@ ular dialog box . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already illuminated file will be selected instead of using a full &amp; CD . &quot;
opens the furniture dialog to configure the type of aler@@ ts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ ses ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main point dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different mapping cards ( such as Encoder , for setting up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right code . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to go , a loss of free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the down@@ sides are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , the information generated by data comp@@ lies depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rate ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , as both Ko@@ di@@ ers will produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rate ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with deeper bit@@ rate . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices are available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , disk ) or special car @-@ stere@@ os@@ systems . today - in the beginning 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for additional parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ Pres@@ et Medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should normally offer for most people and most musical pieces of acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo @-@ fi systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good gen@@ u@@ g for music of young people , portable devices and autoimmune facilities . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exagger@@ ated to most people and most environments , but if you definitely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this option . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information , manually entered or transmitted by the program automatically from the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / needed to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with co@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there is often a combination of programmes for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the aid to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
for example to add the &amp; CD ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are co@@ ded with l@@ ame ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s must be added with l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the outcome looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing on the assistant ) :
&quot; that is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which individuals can download / enter the information , so that all others can download this information instead of text themselves : &amp; CD ; titles , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legally , but I ( An@@ m of the user ) am not lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the CD ; any more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be added . however , all information can be obtained from a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively used to select a cross box ( Send an address ) . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address is not used by the server ( This may only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; in many countries , there are copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; set up for use of free@@ DB , the geo@@ graphi@@ cally closest to the next reflection will be needed . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org supplies a current list of mirror servers for the online call of &amp; CD . alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) just the updates of the database .
which exclu@@ siveness is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that is used to know c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who wants to know more exact , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see you must be noted that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution must first be installed if this has not yet happened . &quot;
&quot; to save the loaded W@@ AV files , the enco@@ ders and hence the desired file format can be chosen . at the first Open are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss of pressing for audio data ) on the tab for inser@@ ting the code . other enco@@ ders can be added at this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ ding package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the enco@@ ding can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined code of code . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ers .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers you can get more information about his switch through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a user window ( eg ; console ) must be replaced by the name of the installed code .
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device &apos;s device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and readers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
&quot; check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD , check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed ! &quot;
&quot; there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have read the complete manual , read everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will launch the program for the first time you set up and read our first &amp; CD . we will l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sampling ( tags ) .
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is not necessary to compile source files , which of course you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is composed and that you have scre@@ ened up ( eg ; by trying to copy it with the Con@@ quer@@ or something . )
&quot; the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something which is probably only done once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for each read @-@ off &amp; CD . &quot;
here we determine the used code of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) and which structure is used . as we are lazy we split the program to download the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not be able to change any &amp; CD at any time . change if the matching settings are found . &quot;
the device @-@ drawing is transferred to the readable program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; frequently , / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbolic link to the actual device drawing of your drives . if this is not working or when more than one &amp; CD / DVD drive is available , it can also be accessed via the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries for the CD @-@ ROM , and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the sound card General settings . here is not much to do . here , an additional conversion may be defined . in our example , everything will be shown / entered as shown in the scre@@ enshot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of un@@ complete information please select , so that you will be informed when data is missing ( tags ) . &quot;
the Kar@@ tei@@ Card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download over the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the machine must be connected to the web while reading the &amp; CD ( connected to the internet so that it can access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection of the box is easier , a &amp; CD which is released , immediately begins the reading of the &amp; CD which is later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory / fil@@ en@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , further to note : if you want to enter everything manually , you disable the selection fields and free@@ DB is not used . however , this over 6@@ 20 MB large , think about it twice if this is worthwhile . to free@@ DB in the offline mode , the two selection fields must be chosen , at least the first . the mode is set up on the next cart . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for invo@@ ke the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB @-@ server via the Internet . how does the system you get to get the CD ? read the section on free@@ DB . do everything as shown in the scre@@ enshot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the site fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror @-@ server in your vicinity . this way , the load between the machines is distributed . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function equivalent to the server , since however , many fire@@ walls have to boot the protocol of 88@@ 80 standard , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to submit a CD @-@ CD to the free@@ DB server . the first an@@ x@@ box should de@@ activate .
just take the settings from the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp is available on your computer )
&quot; simultaneously : excuse me , there is one reason why more than one at the same time only one existing drive ? parallel Read and enco@@ ding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try . &quot;
&quot; CD ; to read the last piece , check this to the &amp; CD , at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom files for temporary files : if you are logged in , the path / folder can be stored in which the W@@ AV files is stored . this field is not enabled , the files in the private folder will not be created . don &apos;t forget that folder if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; all as input as it is on the scre@@ enshot . the command is a bit long , under circumstances you need to be sli@@ pped to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio @-@ quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo units . the achieved bit@@ rate factor is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id 3@@ v@@ 1 &apos; only &apos; for the limitation of tags on version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Day for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; the number of simultaneously enco@@ ding W@@ AV files : with a du@@ al@@ core or quad@@ ri@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried , more than a W@@ AV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading a &amp; CD ; if you choose the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD is described ; we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is arranged on the hard drive , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB has to be described in this section , must be repeated for any out@@ going &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD which is not included in the free@@ DB , the screen photos show slightly different from the data to a &amp; CD ; you will learn from free@@ DB ; data manually , instead of sending them out of the Internet . comments will be given to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &quot; special &quot; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet to happen , now the &amp; CD has to be defined in the main window , which is defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , just like in the scre@@ enshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD , could be identified and be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , then look for questions and answers after help or proceed back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD was picked up successfully by the free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already filled out and will be displayed as the name of the artist and album . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD , there will be a window appears , and you can select the database entry which your opinion best suits your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not select the check box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger you manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but you need the connection to the internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 : 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next scre@@ enshot one . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Cur@@ rent title &apos; to the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist will no longer need to be inspired in the input field &apos; current title &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ op@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from the free@@ DB , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all words with big letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . these limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and on only 28 signs for the commentary box . if you are ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tag , you have unlimited field @-@ length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum permitted . this option will take a look at the tab code settings . &quot;
you can change the day information of the generated files later at any time using the tag Editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ ding to obtain more information .
simply select an entry which is obvious to the style of the thumb@@ nails . in this example this is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD . for more information visit the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under rock .
&quot; after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window , simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you can see that the fields for the album already covered with the data we have already recorded for the first piece . just enter the items for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered all the title dates of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . please note that the artist and the album are shown above the list .
note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected will be read . a simple click on the line switches the selection of piece one or out . make sure that all pieces are selected or press the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at a time .
&quot; by clicking on the button selection , read the read process , then this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going down . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders to switch on the order window . it is in the upper upper half of the window , directly under the buttons on the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the disk . the status of the program is displayed in the bottom of the window in the status bar .
this error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a code that you have not installed yet . pieces which have not been successfully co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you write des@@ ks to the folder for temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred immediately after the end of the reading of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the enco@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . to be carried out and co@@ ding parallel . note the status message at the bottom of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has found no configuration adjustment to sup@@ press this behavior . the only thing is configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes to read and co@@ ding . with high @-@ weak machines , the result is unclear . the used machine with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have any problem with simultaneous output and co@@ ding ( of however two different pieces ) . &quot;
now the last title is read while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is co@@ ded in the queue . after the last piece is co@@ ded with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice . &quot;
&quot; you can talk today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS as part of the k@@ dem@@ ul@@ ti@@ media package . however , if you download CVS , you can download from there an anonymous copy . however , most distri@@ butions are already included in a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; one part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ package is . if you are reading this , you have probably already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons who compile data files , and not for users who are using a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs , the following is correct for you : &quot;
one program that inv@@ okes many different different programs has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it features scre@@ ams of different car@@ cards of settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
&quot; hello , still on the read ? even if only the help menu was clicked on the first start of the program , without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program boot no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what about it ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should somehow look like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author can not sustain this manual . it is meant as the first version for a hand@@ book to &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; but who is always something useful to add or change it . at least just after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has taken this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if it has been able to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kara@@ oke Bar of &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to others he has with real @-@ time engra@@ ved and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ real @-@ character high@@ lighting from texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX . -@@ MIDI players . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the OS@@ S system , so it should work on all systems with OS@@ S - and &amp; k@@ de ; supports also the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ ash@@ an proj@@ ector that is needed for CIS cards . al@@ sa is included as soon as there is a sequ@@ en@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with alternat@@ ing color , making it simple to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI @-@ channel by high@@ lighting the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song@@ writing or text events ) . K@@ Mid determined automatically the procedure used .
&quot; seat support . if you &amp; k@@ de ; end up a song , starts at the next time again with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can choose Open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with whose help you can choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; counter ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this works also with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and pressing the button play@@ through in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or switch the space taste . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will start automatically as soon as you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several stops , they are added to a collection and then played on one another . ) &quot;
&quot; once a piece is played , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regul@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and on the right of the tempo . to get back the original pace , double @-@ click on the tempo - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space @-@ taste has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space is like a pressure on the button break or choose the menu entry into the menu item , so breaks the playing . pressing the space @-@ button while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playing back . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text messages , others use lyrics , others use lyrics . some pieces have no text at all : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be presented and even better : the Ere@@ ign@@ ist@@ type is automatically identified , allowing you to adjust anything manually . however , you still have the option to change this , if you want to see the other type . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up a Ere@@ ch type , choose from the menu settings the entries of text events and loung@@ ing events . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summar@@ ise . these will be played out in this section as you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to attach a collection , first open the Collec@@ ting manager . this can be found in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will be included in the same songs as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the options in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection reach all the songs that you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . concern that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in collecting manager . there , you can add a song using the button add a song . once again the file dialog , with whose help you can choose the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is activated , a piece in opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) will automatically be added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not enabled , in opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and made . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on del@@ e@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are to be played . if you select a row after the menu , the songs are played in sequence , as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add songs or remove or remove random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selective list about the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to further jump a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or push the button arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song back , select the button pre @-@ previous piece , the entry last piece from the menu piece or push the button arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button Clear . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter since they are not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI map General @-@ MIDI events translated into events that synthes@@ izer the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map which conver@@ ts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus getting a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card you don &apos;t need a MIDI map , because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and CIS -@@ cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps , so you must edit the appropriate file from hand ( using your favorite editor ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI map is a text file , which stores all required re@@ alizations for the play of a piece . &quot;
&quot; each section should appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section that may appear as often as desired . however , this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
in this section the patches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM is available in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to set all the sounds that supports this instrument ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , which looks similar to a gun . to do this , enter the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if now a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( a gun ) , it takes a patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here is meant by the term drum patch of the patch , in which every sound is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ instrument ( drum , basin , Mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one , in which the sound means the sound height of the ever same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to specify how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of lines is very important , as is their presence . therefore , you must create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use several names in the first row .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to make notes on the per@@ k @-@ channel channel . take a look at the supplied key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to switch some channels to others . if you want to exchange between the first and second channel , simply complete the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for Key@@ boards which have perc@@ ussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the pattern : &quot;
&quot; n is the channel that is displayed on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used on the file name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , then always Patch x is used . &quot;
the option For@@ ce@@ patch can be useful for example to always use the per@@ k @-@ patch on the per@@ k @-@ channel channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o gives the value of the Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der Event . if a MIDI file is converted to the Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der Event , this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) is calculated and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the Map file no dec@@ imal number will be . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM provides that a keyboard , which is to play a pitch @-@ in @-@ event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , try some key@@ boards to play two notes up to a oc@@ tave . to try to try the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; around . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
&quot; the channel view is a window with a whole range of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you see , which sounds are just played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selective list where you have changed a instrument . if you have changed a instrument , the button is no longer green but red , to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to view the played sounds . view in the menu settings under the point channel view : settings
&quot; the speed of the speed shows the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so if you find for example a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . thus , the same MIDI file may result on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have been compiled a binary distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; we have been compiled as &amp; k@@ mid ; without any A@@ we support , you need to download and install a source of distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree that supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; prior , activate the setting of automatic add to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow key on the left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to dec@@ eler@@ ate the playback . to restore the standard speed you can double on the LCD double .
&quot; I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ work@@ space a &amp; quot ; -@@ window with my MIDI files and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this way , if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or I want to play a file , just into the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window will change the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file , without adding them straight to a collection , turn the automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . opening of files &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. first you just want to play the first file . so make the adjustment automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file . &quot;
then join her to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ate me that , continue to program &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . in the moment I am not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files collect , music and phrases . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; have , or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ or @ ar@@ ra@@ kis@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make a huge pleasure to me if you send me a postcard from your location or MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group , I will send me a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to get in touch with me , as I might have the file already . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time , and no one has done money in my spare time . I would like to stress that I am just about programming , because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;

&quot; and of course , my thanks also applies to all these outstanding musicians on the net that give us this wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ kis@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can view the development , information and look at the pictures . they also find links to sites with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use an FM @-@ device or an A@@ we card .
&quot; if you do not have a sound card , you will need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; using the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL records . it then works as if you have a sound card , except that you cannot listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if any problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists or send a message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files that supported by M@@ player or Ph@@ on@@ on formats , as well as playing DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was still not finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the K@@ DE website to new versions or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
&quot; the application window is made from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window window that will only appear when information is shown in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to select the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , so you should use the category permanent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarch@@ ical bag . if you choose an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and the playback begins with the requested entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; updated piece &apos; , television and continuous playlist files can also be changed by direct editors of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do if &amp; k@@ m@@ player / share / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / , can choose by an editor , but also by using it . simply click on a name of a category cli@@ que , which is displayed just the XML content of this part . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu has to be selected by playlist , and select either the mode , or choose another category . &quot;
all changes are lost when the editing mode will leave or another group will be selected without the playlist .
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation at Star@@ ts and Be@@ enden can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change by &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily added . &quot;
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / share / usr / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during Star@@ ts does not need to be short , it is automatically ended by opening a different source . this would however bother at the end of the animation , the user can finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a Start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; lt ; s ; IM@@ G D@@ ur ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ iles ; / sm@@ iles ; / sm@@ iles ; / sm@@ iled ; / sm@@ iled ; in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL shall be supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider on the configuration of M@@ players in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ player and the memory @-@ size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition device in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ gu@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&quot; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can be inserted even the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist , XML . &quot;
&quot; to enable the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module must be specified as service provider for the m@@ ime type M@@ / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the furnishing dialog file of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is to be started in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . the gest@@ ed process is p@@ opping player . if there is no error occurring here , the back@@ end issue within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; so that a pre @-@ given back@@ end for a particular m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this was also identified ) , this must be done through manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ gu@@ c . for example phon@@ en@@ on all og@@ g files will be re : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be downloaded from TV cards , either using M@@ player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in k@@ m@@ player &apos;s settings in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ video port to use . there , ports should be found out of which one is selected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B included in it . &quot;
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player only X@@ video can also work ( presumably this type of play@@ room of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also possible only on the first screen ( : 0.@@ 0 ) . this is why the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension has to be functional for the X server ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
&quot; internally , from SMEs are used different names in sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ y , external source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if you get enabled , they begin playing the playlist . &quot;
are there any indications how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive more iser when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM is required as a user root after adju@@ sting the device . it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / CD@@ ROM is on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
X@@ ine starts slowly but why does every time my CPU have to be tested on their performance ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ heated . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs automatically the last recorded value , only the first time the CPU will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t : : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphic user surfaces and network support and becomes for comp@@ iling of &amp; ki@@ le ; required .
l@@ atex ; : a professional font application . under Unix @-@ like systems is probably attributed to the package &amp; tex@@ tual ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution included . for the installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD can be used .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; project contains several pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iles and are included on the ki@@ le ; -@@ website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must probably hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation should be taken into account . if support for this project or the documentation is desired , the contact with the ki@@ le should be made . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions about or when comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ; on or become extensions , this should be addressed on the mailing list ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ environment in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ programs . furthermore , the possibility to complete comp@@ iling , re@@ edit and troubles@@ hooting for these . finally , the possibility to complete use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and its possibilities to learn should be used the manual to K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can begin there directly with reading the chapter on the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ;

&quot; posted here only a good clear view to &amp; l@@ atex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to it . B. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ AL@@ Y , A Guide to &amp; l@@ atex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ here . &quot;
&quot; just like other sig@@ nat@@ es , involves &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction to which the general characteristics such as paper format , side number@@ ing and text box begins with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { document } and needs to be closed with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { document } . &quot;
the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a special feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard offers some possibilities for the creation of the document . it can also be done some on the document related settings .
&quot; documentation : this way the way of the document is displayed : articles ( article ) , book &#91; Read &#93; , Book &#91; Read &#93; , Book &#91; DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; proj@@ ector &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ ans &#93; or Custom . &quot;

new users do not have to worry about it . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information in this section are given in the section .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; ki@@ le ; however , it is easy to find that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , it will save you by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you by the modest appearance of time and time . &quot;
&quot; with automatic verification of the environments , by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) by &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically a blank ( to enter the text ) and the corresponding line to the end of the command . set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands may be de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ f@@ ent element ) : &quot;
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse @-@ click on the respective . &quot;
when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful with the appropriate file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent File ) &#93; , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; -@@ Viewer to the appropriate line in &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source text . &quot;
&quot; a DV@@ I ; file contained a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document , and also other information like the font . there are many tools to view , conversion and print of DV@@ I ; files for different systems and scent . &quot;
when using the search bar the elements of the DV@@ I ; file with the editor is shortened and as soon as a item in the DV@@ I ; -@@ source text was attached to the same place in the DV@@ I ; -@@ source text is attached to the appropriate place in the DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer .
Master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a Master document the work with other integrated .@@ tex files will be simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide Master document can be set to project settings .
quick @-@ making : the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no errors in the source code exist ) .
&quot; extension of file : in this mode , the DV@@ I ; file on the F@@ n@@ der@@ ungen@@ â on the ground floor , and it does not take a call from &amp; Ok@@ ular@@ line ; after the fast @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; in view of editing tool@@ bar , the three large @-@ colour selection fields should be following . the selection fields were designed for the fast submission of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The se@@ duc@@ tive &amp; l@@ atex ; commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection field More is for entries of articles such as tags , joints , notes or references . &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , one image or other element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for a reference to a fixed name ( selection over a selection field ) .
&quot; using quote is displayed a selection list with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex , this only works if the file is included in a project . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ r will be used for determining the font , the key text for the main text , the joints , etc . they stand for : &quot;
&quot; when you call &amp; ki@@ le , two selection options are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and the appropriate settings . 2 . the document may be written from scratch . &quot;
&quot; the brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ . class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; puts the font . the font should not be fixed at the beginning , this can also happen in the text . &quot;
once the above code document has to be entered the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source text must be compiled . the easiest way to do is the use of building building or the button speed .
the code must be saved in front of the comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le ; the storage is automatically saved .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document was missing , should be sought after the errors in the protocol . when using quick @-@ making should be started . if it is not the case , it should also be considered the protocol . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English . environment ) is a text which is treated differently from the remaining document . for example , a report with the font should have created 12 . the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ end } . &quot;
the displayed are merely inside the environment ( from \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } to \ \ end } . there are no instructions inside an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities of reading the read@@ ability and usability of the document . it can be added for example certain fonts , fat pressure , cran@@ ial pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ Beg@@ in { emp@@ h } : this command is closed for the short expression and is as long as long until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be described with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ rate : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ Beg@@ in { rate } and ends with \ \ &apos; rate } .
&quot; after the background to write the source text with the &amp; l@@ atex ; recording @-@ language was presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; once in the assistant a little text was entered , a few adjustments to be accomplished for better read@@ ability of the document . for this reason a quotation , a few positions in the fat and cur@@ ant pressure and a poem to use are to be seen in order to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , can be re@@ printed by editor @-@ view or Str@@ g E again ( with the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window needs to be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DV@@ I ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script file . simply try and spa@@ wn . &quot;
DV@@ I ; is a leading file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi issue like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF @-@ converting or computer screen . &quot;
for the printing of a &amp; DV@@ I ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DV@@ I can be printed out ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is correctly adjusted ) .
&quot; tool@@ bar allows the transformation of the DV@@ I ; file into other formats . as soon as the DV@@ I ; file created from the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source text , the conversion can be performed by the kno@@ bs in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
looking for the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DV@@ I ; file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . this must simply set up Modern under settings Ki@@ le ... tools be@@ ys .
&quot; for example , the mouse @-@ cursor needs to be positioned in a line of source tex@@ tual and shut @-@ looking for curtains . the jump to the appropriate place in the DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer is done so . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular@@ line ; document with a click of the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; document the corresponding &amp; l@@ atex ; document of &amp; ki@@ le ; printed and attached to the corresponding line ; to set up as a text editor ( settings Ok@@ ular@@ line ... editor )
&quot; should , when using fast @-@ making of the &amp; DV@@ I ; viewers will not be available , a bug can be available . if a bug is available , this is displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the protocol file lists the error source in the source text . in the editor , the protocol file can always be used , in which the error appears to be clicked on the error in the log file , must be clicked on the error in the protocol and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to the faul@@ ty row . &quot;
&quot; once on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window displays a window to choose the suitable template for the document . the presented features are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting a certain document , a document may either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard for quick creation of a new document . more information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; average users of &amp; l@@ atex ; usually do not use the same introduction for almost all documents . Templ@@ ates in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file has to be created or created a new file . &amp; ki@@ le ; a new template can create a document and selecting a file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using file new , some string chains be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or string code ) . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this character chain is used by entering a documentary class . typically they are used in the following types : \ \ Re@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the results of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way :
&quot; when creating a new document , you can create your own template instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; l@@ atex ; files created . a simple way to create a template , should be sought after one on the internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the flexibility of reading and high@@ lighting from many different kinds of text files ( including &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; K@@ ate ; can be made available in the menu item directly from &amp; ki@@ le ;
to learn more Ã ¼ ber &amp; K@@ ate ; and its possibilities should be experienced the manual to K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; you can start directly with reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command reference , which can be called for the aid of La@@ Te@@ X reference . it covers an exclusive description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use , as well as their syn@@ tax . &quot;
&quot; a double @-@ click with penetr@@ ated str@@ g button to drop the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way clicking \ \ par \ \ par \ \ , \ \ par \ \ , is only \ \ par . &quot;
&quot; in the dra@@ gging of the text with penetr@@ ated lin@@ ker , the text will automatically be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with penetr@@ ated switch , parts of the source text can be seen in the editing window . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the ability to browse the most different kinds of source texts and to emphasize them . for example the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ ae are highlighted by another color .
&quot; a lot of assistants can be included in the spr@@ ing@@ time . this is an individual type of book@@ marks within the text . also , this jumping mark is highlighted , so that it is automatically attached to the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; however , outstanding features have been added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; special commands may include the following commands to the text code : &quot;
&quot; like a complete paragraph ( group of lines , which included on both sides a blank lines ) . with a paragraph , this extended meaning is not meant to contain tables , &amp; l@@ atex ; commands and all other lines of source texts . this is the only pro@@ phy@@ l@@ ent thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is therefore that the cancellation is separated by two blank lines . &quot;
&quot; select the word under the current curr@@ ent@@ position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also has &amp; l@@ atex ; commands with a rich star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for example , a part of the document may be removed from this first and by dr@@ ush the key to be removed . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the key@@ word C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole row is removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers the following commands to enter into the text : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description of the Edit paragraph .
it has already been illustrated that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore offers &amp; ki@@ le ; for NF further commands under editing surroundings for a better work with &amp; l@@ atex ;
this command will be j@@ umped to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the bottom of the surroundings .
this command ends at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the end of the surroundings .
&quot; if the cursor is located before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { setting } , becomes the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; with the input of many cran@@ ky ambient commands , quickly the overall outlook can be lost . this instruction was shut down the most recently renovated environment , so that the con@@ stri@@ cken ambient structure is not fl@@ atter@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; groups that are determined by brack@@ ets { ... } are a few important commands , which correspond to those from editing environment . &quot;
this command takes place at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right in front of the damaged bracket .
this command ends at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right behind the lit bracket .
if the cursor is located before or behind the car@@ ded bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is set to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many wel@@ ded groups @-@ brack@@ ets can be lost quickly the overall outlook . this instruction was shut down the last updated group , so that the wel@@ ded structure of &amp; tex ; groups do not fall short . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; l@@ atex ; two simple addition to the purpose is used . for the purpose of purpose , the character is used . &quot; &quot; the sign &quot; &quot; is used for two simple application characters . &quot;
this automatic filing of the double box characters can be set up under settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X and are sign@@ posted .
&quot; you can also use L@@ Ã © specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) , and thus German or French can be used . &quot;
&quot; for the Shift key of Shift ; input taste for Shift key ; if the current position is located inside a lists - for example en@@ um@@ eration or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example , not only a pointer shift but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; located inside a tables environment , gir@@ t &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an att@@ une pointer change . &quot;
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support imagined &amp; l@@ atex ; - or user @-@ defined environments under settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; some users want to classi@@ fy the columns in tables and thereby arrange all the E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; if this tab is not the same , if this tab is not the same , for the columns position of the current tab@@ ular columns . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; K@@ ate ; already offers a good source text editor , this in &amp; ki@@ le ; for special commands ( usually for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) are still extended . we are working three according to demand and the other two are set for automatic inspection among settings . &quot;
when you start a new environment using the \ \ Beg@@ in { setting } &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end } according to an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when using the bar , the last letter will be removed from the input and therefore the full list of letters can be reduced . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering a further letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions can be removed from &amp; ki@@ le ; alternatively , jumping brands can be found , so that a simple jump to these positions can be found using mach@@ ined jumping mat . &quot;
&quot; under settings ti@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le , different colors can be made for these lists ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands , as well as if the general language used can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the instruction mode is not appropriate for the termination of environments . it is always a couple of letters with \ \ Beg@@ in entered , and the call of a complete list is often used with ambient mode . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for completion of the environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the full range of Alt + Shift key , the command to be performed automatically and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in . after that , the surrounding area can be continued on the simplest way and by pressing the input button . &quot;
&quot; after this has been accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a lists environment , even a first \ \ item command is folded . &quot;
&quot; under settings ti@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; this mode uses the list of operation mode for vor@@ tex , and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; supported user @-@ defined lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which are immediately replaced by L@@ Ã ating strings . the lists can be found ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; used , for example , the letter L entered and the word activation mode is inserted , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;

&quot; the dialog graphics are designed to include graphics as simple as possible . on the clear @-@ view of the bases for the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and he@@ eded . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer a superb basis for placing and new orders from pages . the PDF output can be arranged and then be converted with p@@ s@@ 2@@ pdf in a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to compile the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all the tools are group@@ ings in the menus to create comp@@ iling , creating converting and creating view . &quot;

the script function of &amp; ki@@ le ; allows the drill of EC@@ MA@@ Script enco@@ ding . the scripts can be managed in the vertical Le@@ list .
&quot; the API @-@ scripts are not yet fin@@ alized , and can be installed in further versions of &amp; ki@@ le . &quot;
&quot; first of all , it must be said that the export environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a systematic object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods : &quot;
&quot; l@@ atex ; is a quite pronounced system , where basic functions can be expanded through a variety of different packages . &quot;

&quot; a complete refer@@ n@@ z for vor@@ tex ; and on the thread of the thread . this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather it is a complete looking for a specific form@@ atting . since this is a very rough document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ ex , the finding of the correct document is not always easy . as a simple help , a database with all to &amp; ki@@ le ; supplied documents and thereby a graphic top . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the advantage is the search for parcel of name or impact . by &amp; ki@@ le ; then only the results are shown .

output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time if meant pro@@ c .
&quot; as already said , everybody who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ oration , there is now a great graphical interface for this . &quot;
&quot; if the currently open file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply leave the current working folder . if not , then select current working folders and enter the folder , where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output at the screen , her file is faul@@ ty . please check the errors and try again . &quot;

&quot; if the file was to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if not , they can easily be selected . if not , remove the selection of the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file sel@@ ector . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result is named , the file is usually stored in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ness ; even though little too do . this makes the plug @-@ system very powerful . you can not wait from the additional functionality immediately and must not wait until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we begin with the menu plugins Edit . thus , the following dialogue is opened : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all the included plugins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
&quot; here , one can input the search ad . when adding plug @-@ ins without a memory location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in . &quot;
&quot; often , on a project , several individuals are working in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties control . &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . ni@@ ck@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves for unique identification .
one member may have several roles in the project as well as team leader as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can look out of the members of the team members who he is . this happens by finding the team member from the list and replace the button as an expresses . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears as follows : text .
nickname and setting of their own identity are important with regard to messages and notes . see further information on comments .
besides the overview of her team there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be created an event of information to the team leader if something is happening . see in for further information .
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed if something specific is happening in the project . an example would be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that is added to the project , as soon as it is added to the project , etc . &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings Di@@ alo@@ ges can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
&quot; an email will be sent to the addres@@ see in the addres@@ see list of selected addres@@ see . the addres@@ see can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project manager . see , we@@ i such ladder will be set up . &quot;
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
&quot; to enter comments is simple , either the note item selected from the Editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary box followed by hint text . &quot;
&quot; notes can be sent to a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case the syn@@ tax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the nickname of the sub@@ project manager for the departments and sub @-@ project leaders should be described , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nickname and roller names are independent of large or small , but spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a development environment for scrip@@ t- and form@@ atting languages that D@@ T@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic is supported and web@@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by setting the settings via settings Qu@@ anta . this dialogue extends over some pages that will be dealt with each other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; regarding tags including car completion can be modified with it . the entries are :
&quot; large / petit @-@ writing of tags : large / petit @-@ scription of automatically arranged tags . normal wholesale / petit @-@ scription means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / micro@@ Sett@@ lement of attributes : large / small@@ - of automatically arranged attributes . normal wholesale / petit @-@ scription means , the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if challenged , for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the bed . &quot;
not optional tags automatically include : as for all other tags except for simple tags .
&quot; start @-@ up and finish line automatically update : if switched on , the appropriate day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic release of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acceptable signs into the corresponding co@@ ding during penetration .
m@@ ime types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect different types of files . using the default button the default settings can be recovered .
default character enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding from newly created or in other way open to file opening files ( where the code of the file can be passed over ) but this option is loaded from the same into the proj@@ ec@@ o@@ ks if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is downloaded from the same in the proj@@ ec@@ o@@ ks if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ nel ; created regular backup copies , so with a black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . even for yet stored documents a backup is regularly created , according to the specified time . &quot;
&quot; preview and documentation can be viewed either in the editing area or your own view ( or the documentation in a car@@ divi@@ des ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings back next to the next start is useful when the user interface by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views have come to each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ ype command line parameters .
the warning application area serves the taxes of the possibility to switch the display of warnings by no more inqu@@ ire .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the syn@@ cing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in the shared mode . in terms of different modes see .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which displays the figure of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse kno@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; in the range of structural @-@ tree settings , the visibility of the knot@@ s can be automatically opened at editing and how deep when changing the structural tree is automatically opened . blank no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such that no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the area for fixing of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which can be valid at editing to extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are valid , each one can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ eit@@ ing is something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plugins are K@@ part @-@ applications of third page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; kon@@ os@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following are stated : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not on a stand@@ still like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
&quot; input : this information will be delivered to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ esis &quot; mode : check if the plugin is denied boarding . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse the shop , if this option is not chosen . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; whether the provided information is correct . if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; from version 3.3 , the error @-@ looking was completely new . the support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin concept was implemented , which enables different implement@@ ations to plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only a plugin is available to support the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . &quot;
&quot; the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plug @-@ in , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger project is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ aneous ; -@@ interface : &quot;
a view where the content of monitoring variables is displayed . usually appears in the left @-@ hand dock .
&quot; a view in which all the half points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything is available or part of the following functionality . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in with to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan &apos;s requirements . this action is carried out by default if a project is opened , so that normally does not need to be respected . &quot;
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or exit the foli@@ age to requirements .
send a HTTP requirement to the server to submit a Deb@@ u@@ g requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to watch the current document . the output of this requirement will be displayed in the Debug@@ ger output .
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script and to send information about the monitoring variables as well as the current posted line continuously . if this happens , the execution is continued . if this happens before a debit card started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script , without sending information to monitoring variables and the current character number . if this happens during a script running smoothly running the execution starts , the execution starts as soon as a requirement is made . &quot;

&quot; this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing to your needs , and how you can help you to become better . &quot;
&quot; documentation Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ance ; used to provide support for mark@@ up and scripts , as well as &amp; CSS . they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ability ; ability to complete user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s there are two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two pieces , the tag folder , and equ@@ XML files ; and Tag@@ XML files contain two dat@@ atyp@@ es ( above the Edi@@ tier window ) , the text and instructions can insert faster into a document than a user ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see in for details of conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; counter p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ makers . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ di@@ alo@@ ges , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; itself . tools enable quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without any danger of writing . &quot;
&quot; day folders are nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; counter p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day folders carry the name of the writ@@ able language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the equ@@ XML and declare whether it is necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so that other users have better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element of the individual . everything about possibilities and borders are explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a day XML document . it can contain only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it can contain only one element type about yourself . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument to the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day type class is valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type Meth@@ od . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a Free attribute and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
put a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day determined . that is a just element type element .
&quot; describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for any attribute . it lays down the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags you describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc . this is a just one element type element . &quot;
prints the source texts for the attributes used in the Day @-@ Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in the attribute @-@ tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting @-@ site and a methodology . the arguments that can be handed over to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
one vessel tag allows the elements of a list together . it may occur for an attribute description only once . it is a only element type element .
place the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialogue process . this day can occur for any attribute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; * &gt; day ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the same tags . this element is just one element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a just element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; this declaration shall begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly cool@@ ed and closed .
&quot; space do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced ; text &gt; will not make a leg change , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to verify the equ@@ XML files , the tools above is to start up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to select a further dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , the check occurs only at the loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . &quot;
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; diagram . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this equ@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this equ@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
&quot; the &amp; counter p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for this , accessible via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ T@@ D settings ; for one of a list of sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; General &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified is the name being used as Ni@@ ck@@ name .
an action can set up with settings actions ... created . click New action leads to the same dialog :
this action has been assigned as short@@ cut . by clicking the user interface it can be assigned as a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ einer is the current keyboard short@@ cut .
&quot; the simplest actions . it can be entered into a text in the detection settings , and with execution of the action , this text will be inserted in the document on the current cursor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but on this it is not limited ) to change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) ; themselves are the quick start -@@ dialogue or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first of all , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be given . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ ting you variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / scripts / scripts in their path : $ path There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file is file : / from the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the ongoing &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ nel ; only one instance is running , the text is attached to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above listed methods , a script input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ nel can counter@@ act on the default . in the selection field input may be determined what to send to default . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input is normally only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the available application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of issue : normal issue , posted to the default output ; it can be specified , which should be done with the text written by the default output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create a separate tool@@ bar . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you have to add actions and configure actions . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
&quot; fill out all the necessary fields , add it to the appropriate tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; complete everything and , if the day attributes has attributes and you plan their use , activate a dialog &quot; day , &quot; if available , so that a input will be possible when using the promotion . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? will we replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit mag . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a laun@@ cher as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as useless , sti@@ te , continue to interpret ) , or should at least , a message to the user is sign@@ aled , stopping ; -@@ day in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol , it has to be associated with action . this happens through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . besides the text field there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the appropriate button , and continue with other tags , so there are , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to supplement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; functions to tool@@ bar or it should be used to set up a better overview of some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool@@ bar set up dialogue via settings tool@@ bar . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; I want to choose the tor@@ ch ( completely left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , which is to be added to tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to add a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , like the den@@ omin@@ ator support the group@@ ing . anyone who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by applying all symbols to make sure everything works .
&quot; after real@@ e@@ XML does not exist , there will be im@@ partial folders stored , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please fit their &amp; D. p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) , if a file is opened from the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ance ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting , which you may love most . therefore , this chapter describes how I first describe a &amp; PHP ; documentation for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ repository , whether someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you , the second treat us here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , for example : Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html 2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html , 1 = 1 / html 2 = 1 = html 5 = 1 = html &gt; &quot;
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree . for example you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation like something :
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc You = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element = PHP 4.2 on Dis@@ ting Star@@ ted = Inclu@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Inclu@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Inclu@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = mag@@ net@@ .@@ html ... Language Re@@ ference = basic syn@@ tax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Re@@ ference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess work@@ book ( except the reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the index directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently on the top of the tree @-@ view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
&quot; space do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ oration ; resources are being replaced . &quot;
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed for the design of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , if writing a &amp; PHP , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function should be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of by Be@@ ist@@ rich isolated context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c and in accordance with $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation used were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ nel ; -@@ community . they will not be wealthy , but proud to have been involved in the best Web@@ Development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ nel ; are you not alone . it is possible to share the cre@@ tion of resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tools , with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else who will be sent . at different places there is an email return menu , such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ings ; users can be downloaded and only available when our team needs to be signing , why there is a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of resources is ensured , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have several keys you may want to look out . in dialogue New resource , you can be empty ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with clicking on OK the up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can upload from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ness ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signature . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the specification of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages that is currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , creating a D@@ TE@@ P package may be required . there is the easier way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion may be started by the D@@ T@@ D loading and Conver@@ ting a D@@ T@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description , which should be used . after that , the following dialogue appears : &quot;
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; used with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition line : the string chain , which is released in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE day , such as HTML Public - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loo@@ se@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ance ; according to the conversion the &amp; counter p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and get full benefit from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing . this chapter tries to give them precisely these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ nel . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available to anyone who is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ aneous ; used , available . by tool@@ ing over actions is all that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this enables the group of administrators to secure tools , actions and patterns in a global tree , which then can be available each in a multi @-@ user environment at the system . &quot;
local elements pose a personal collection of web developers for a single user . they are user @-@ specific patterns and tools . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; models up to tool work with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project which is the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project em@@ ö@@ g@@ light .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the building views , the car@@ ni@@ ches with info and the tool@@ bar . please hit , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the log@@ otype with the right button of the mouse button to re@@ charge a context menu with the current document requirements , such as close the current , other or all of the le@@ aven , to delete , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the Edi@@ tors area lead to a further context menu regarding the processed document@@ aries , such as basic processing steps ( out / copy / paste / paste ) , editing of the cursor under the mouse @-@ cursor or opening the file , if the string chain under the mouse cursor is called a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the Edi@@ tor@@ f@@ ator , the tool@@ boards are part of the Edi@@ tors . currently , &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of machine tools is shown . in the course of further construction of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ings , the tools are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of machine tools is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; then click on the icon which represents the day . now , you can insert the data for this just added tag . if you want to insert the data for this just one day ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the Bau@@ man@@ ners ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate into the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ance ; to navigate , to open and ro@@ am . in the presentation with carto@@ ons are available for files , project , model , attributes , attributes , and documentation construction . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; this view displays all files in the project and allows the administrator of the files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , upload , or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium with which then shown context menu can be performed . &quot;
&quot; another option of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all options open . &quot;
&quot; templates are divided into three categories , depending on what connection they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ nel . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the appropriate users and templates in projects are only available in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration into Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking on the left mouse button , you can invo@@ ke the available information to a script . on the right mouse button are further functions available , such as the script to edit , edit or send by email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking an element , the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands in terms of navigation and refres@@ hes of the tree will open . &quot;
this tree appears under the other sub @-@ views . with it can change some quickly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . the contents of all available attributes allows to change all the available attributes with few clicks .
&quot; here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ oration ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; &apos; documentation site to create , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be made , edited and considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two Kar@@ divi@@ des at the bottom of the window , about the beneficial information can be achieved : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
this mapping shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . such as the currently used D@@ T@@ D of the current document and all changes to the D@@ T@@ D are shown .
&quot; this mapping shows all errors in the market up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , enter all error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; tool tools are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol , and they get the appropriate command shown . the chocolate site of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . &quot;
&quot; a further function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the tool@@ bar as a comp@@ acted T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they can secure and load a tool@@ bar in an email ; how to secure and load them ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of &amp; qu@@ ap@@ ing ; files on your system . therefore , auto@@ conf@@ use a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . / configure --@@ help one . the options are simple to understand and not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems with Star@@ ts &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ athy , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 am folder . also , you should make sure that is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the path in front of her am folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a web development tool for K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for swift web development and combined a well @-@ engineered development environment with a wide variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor to create , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul had ? well , this would make him absolutely greatest web development tools for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer confined to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; well , is already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . &quot; &quot; summar@@ ized : &quot; &quot; then you should define it in &amp; XML ; then the appropriate &amp; IDE should be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above priority must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; followed , in good use of free software , the idea of Why developing , what has been developed by anyone else ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; stret@@ cher is not just this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; it enables web developers to make use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can significantly increase productivity by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted promotions , scripts and tools . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted promotions , scripts and machine tools , it is possible to expand the efficiency of almost every task . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for quick web development and was quickly expanded to a well @-@ engineered editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way linked to commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developer left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more to the details of the documentation is using help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ os@@ or ; input or cau@@ dal centre help : / qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; it is currently developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ le sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick @-@ edge list of files you have opened . this list is changing every@@ time , if you open a file which is not located , whereby the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check out the section about templates . should they try to store the selected file / text outside of local / project pre @-@ installation , only a mistake will be reported . &quot;
conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there included special characters to the &amp; HTML ; so that it is displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a form@@ atting guide .

invites a project tool@@ bar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bar and are only available in this menu when you have assigned them to this project .
&quot; a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . that only creates the name . actions must be saved through configuration actions ... added , or you will be asked about tools , whether you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not delete it from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message using tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows the up@@ loading of machine tools to the main server , where everyone can access it . &quot;

&quot; this menu includes a list of tags available in the currently loaded mode . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there are in the tags menu a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current tag dialog , when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; enabled or de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this means only using ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting tools via tool@@ bar is denied , if this day in this place contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;

&quot; instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries the switch is sometimes need to need or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the mapping mode , which also default , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu includes an entry for each open sub@@ window entry . with selection of a box the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
on the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; main window on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affects every application , which use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web@@ browser . &quot;
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; find details .
&quot; a dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or which can add and change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse cursor , but it is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; Saul &apos;s high @-@ quality product , it is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ aneous ; -@@ Development in financial form , you will find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , as for example after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will automatically be completed . all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties can be set . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file will be automatically filled out . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small case letters and without spaces with the extension of web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you have the server address of the machine to which one wants to access , except you can edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ett@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol is used . depending on the adjustment of the remote computer , an adaptation might be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this folder instead of the standard should be set . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which tools can do for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this folder instead of the standard should be set . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . it can be selected several files or whole folder .
&quot; this setting is great if you have st@@ ati@@ cal content , you want to download and change . with ser@@ ver@@ ted script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently . &quot;
&quot; let us leave if files , which are to be integrated in the main sub@@ folders of the project . if a project is started anew , not dec@@ ha@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main board and you can make a detailed selection for th@@ inner . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by clicking or , by removing the tick , cl@@ inging out of the project . &quot;
&quot; the last screen of the new project assistant includes three settings that simplify your work . these settings can upload , up@@ loading profiles in the menu with project properties in the sub@@ window Profile , or change with the short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 . &quot;
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) who can be re @-@ read for project @-@ related operations like project folders .
&quot; supple@@ mentary option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded during opening the project . in more than proj@@ ections can be read . &quot;
&quot; with this , the desired Debug@@ ger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the button options . in addition , the fault @-@ search is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles can upload up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a modular view of the contents of the server for each profile , adding an independent view to each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window of event configuration , you can switch to event actions and add these actions to change or delete . events actions are executed when a certain event occurs , such as the Si@@ des of a file . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behaviour is not possible to influence . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , choose project open ... from the menu project or the icon will open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . they will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ance ; changed files . same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
project man@@ ners gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folder behave as well , but the entries are open and opening with ... with the right mouse button @-@ up menu : &quot;
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ loaded files . see .
&quot; allows the removal of the current profile . if only more a profile is available , the button is das@@ hed to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password is kept in the core memory and forget with programs . this option is useful , if common up@@ loading files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password to save -@@ option does not come into question . &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog until you change your mind from the up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ oration , many high la@@ undering profiles can be compiled and therefore the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server that should be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; a file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
&quot; the port for transfer . usually , this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them at your discretion . the password is saved on the record , so it can not be easily read , but anyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ makers . it can be loaded in a project many views , that is , through simple exchange views , various files and tool@@ bar can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; views can be opened in the menu project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , opened or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ athy , with which one has to do most . this helps not only boost productivity , but also allows modification of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool work in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best to perform above the menu tool@@ bar . use and add . the addition of tool@@ bar is treated in the section add of tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; tool@@ bar and symbols can be set either via context @-@ menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new tool@@ bar can be created , tool@@ bar or tool@@ bar can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog , which can be stated where actions on this or other tool can be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additionally the entries must be removed and action em@@ itted , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tools ... and setup actions .. set .
&quot; templates are basically used in the essential document skel@@ eton , code sn@@ aps and files for inter@@ locking and interfaces . one can copy , move , or mount each on the system existing directory in the device tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ nel ; in about the restrictions you imagine for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ nel ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions introduced at the beginning of each presentation .
&quot; bin@@ ar is all that is not pur@@ er text . there can be any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually inserted in documents by means of links ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ tree under global templates . &quot;
documents can be created by any text document . based on these templates new documents can be created . normally a simple smells for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in a corresponding way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the pro@@ found@@ ly tree under global templates . see for more information about templates .
this type templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area always should be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . see below for more information on templates .
&quot; as the name says , these Templ@@ ates for whole websites serve as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , is summar@@ ized in a comp@@ acted tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure after expos@@ ing ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file as a template store as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once that has happened , notice that ( even if it was stored as a project location ) , the template is not visible in the project tree . take a look at the default tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As a template to save as a local / project position . alternatively , the selection can simply be drawn with drag and attach to the Bau@@ man@@ ners templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy in a single @-@ level sub@@ folder . all file management functions can be used for this , such as pulling and insert or inser@@ ting over the file tree from Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a file tree or in the project files , select a name for the template and secure . by default it is secured within the project folder , but of course it can be saved as local or global templates . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented way @-@ to @-@ step . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ er head@@ lines or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; in addition , you can add some things when using templates in projects very profound in mind . &quot;
the basic structure in the sub@@ window Templ@@ ates is based on the files in the $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / usr / qu@@ anta / templates . each of this folder matches one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to set the behavior of a folder , click with the right mouse button to click on the folder and select in the context menu item . the following dialogue appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is b@@ anded as soon as El@@ ter@@ ous attributes have been stopped . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default , and fits everything except for the regul@@ ator in the device . if a regular folder would be dis@@ continued , unless it would be explicitly activated . in case of normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ building . if nothing appears , one is probably in a regular folder . &quot;
&quot; permitted or following text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project , enabling a presentation of content templates to a folder of special head@@ lines / foot@@ er , to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you have a text menu ( to show right mouse button ) about a full command collection for adding folders , or copy , and paste it from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor used over the menu View . the first mode replaces the editor @-@ window in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor .
&quot; the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML , page and a cursor . then you can edit and switch on if needed to source code editor , where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor will be visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor on a document , the &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ source text . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor . there is no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source text editor as well as in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor synchron@@ ized in the source text editor , and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor synchron@@ ized in the source code , this mode is already active , puts the touch of the active cursor from one window to another , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation gap between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta up .... After choosing from V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in the selection automatically , the recommendation can be adjusted for fast computer and a large span@@ ish for slow . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , this is called tool@@ ing properties . thus , the editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor is also called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor it is used to change : &quot;
met@@ a tags permit the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click on the list allows modification of content such as key words on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word list .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way for designing the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules to the buttons below the list or delete . a change about the list is as possible with the met@@ a elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style order by pressing the file @-@ open button and choose the appropriate file .
&quot; the use of the cur@@ sors is as possible in a text processing , by filling with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor works like usual . text can be inserted through inser@@ tion and by means of back or del@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way via the tool@@ box , as in the source text editor . it is necessary to note that inser@@ ting tags before already existing tags are not removed , e.g. if an anchor day , surrounded with text must be removed any other circum@@ ference anchor day . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ makers , such as the tables assistant or the lists are disabled . they will work later in the &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bar must be used . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style times . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for specific elements is possible and the execution of the Stil@@ ts can be pro@@ secuted . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , need except &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ lt and li@@ b@@ x@@ ml , which are already available in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; &quot;
&quot; grip in a template , at a place in one by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g downloaded Stil@@ - or x@@ ml file or at the current knot@@ s . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in the g@@ d@@ b compatibility mode can be set in a specific file and pointer number and later be activated . &quot;
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g lets the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a p@@ adding . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top loaded file ( / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l ) is possible for example to input :
&quot; this command will be checked for a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ age called QNAP ME or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template agrees with any QNAP ME , which contains the character chain template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the given &quot; QNAP ME &quot; is extended according to the rules which is defined by the name defined in the X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a decent semi @-@ point must be dissolved for the associated UR@@ I and pointer number . this will automatically be executed when charging the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . bracket will be re@@ reviewed shortly after the start of each passing point .

start a shell . enter the &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; -@@ command &quot; help &quot; to obtain an overview of the help .
adds the parameter with the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ M@@ gt ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the documentation for the command &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot;
&quot; introduces the conversion 20 times when --@@ we@@ a@@ then is specified , the conversion is carried out 100 times . &quot;
the input documents are treated as HTML files when the support for this in li@@ b@@ x@@ ml has been activated .
activ@@ ates the X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input document if the support for this is enabled in li@@ b@@ x@@ ml . this is switched as default
on systems with installed re@@ ad@@ line library you can browse the arrow keys to / from the publisher &apos;s storage to date .
several commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to put together compound words as an argument . &amp; eg ; : using the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument a bracket will be put into a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that consists only from the AS@@ C@@ II characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ pl@@ ate@@ name . &quot;
&quot; fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the system of the user . on Uni@@ xes or cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; &quot; ~ &quot; &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . on R@@ IS@@ C @-@ OS systems are also other ambient variables . &quot;
&quot; path : a path to switch between the work@@ board . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; &quot; ~ &quot; &quot; will be replaced by the path to your personal folder . &quot;
Data : the XML @-@ data or the XML _ document that is edited by the Stil@@ ts . see also &amp; lt ; FI@@ LE@@ NA@@ ME ; and &amp; lt ; UR@@ I@@ ts ;

there are many graphical tools to be the same . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
&quot; the merger was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes , and at the same time had changed the entry into many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts together . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the rec@@ ol@@ ding had changed . this changes was a small nightmare . &quot;
&quot; that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; it could represent differences within a line and changes to white signs . later , a lot more useful features were added . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare fast text for example , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it to one of the comparative window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work was the comparisons , and merge folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser . &quot;
also 3 @-@ way @-@ merge is fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently of each other at a piece of code and make modifications . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve any changes . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three Qu@@ ell files in conjunction with :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also with the comparisons and merge complete folder . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; Du@@ diff@@ 3 ; execute the folder :
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and serve to the possibilities of current color monitors . if you have to check this feature frequently , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ s are visible in a certain number of white signs , one can see that in a certain number of white signs , one can see that at a glance at the column at the left side . ( no more trouble , when someone changes the recovery . ) &quot;
&quot; if one file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color shows which file is different . red color means that both of them differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files are the same name , but in different folders , you can ease the ti@@ pping work by using only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 folder @-@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 folder @-@ 3 folder @-@ 3 folder @-@ 3 folder @-@ 3 folder @-@ 3 folder @-@ folder , &quot;
&quot; opening dialog allows the manual type of file name , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the opening bar . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file for the next time ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed . &quot;
&quot; via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparisons will be selected , for B and C however a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if together , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately set a output file . you can also finish this step later when storing . &quot;
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the comparisons .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparative window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog you need to select no files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also drag and attach it : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you like to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would only have to download two appropriate files , it in &amp; diff@@ use . now you can copy the relevant sections simply copy , insert and then compare . &quot;
note : at present you can &apos;t pull anything out of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; only the case of text in a comparative window is supported .
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the pulling and insert of text into another program as l@@ apping and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each word window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest a while above the row . then a small relief window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed through the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one sees in the color that file differs . if both files differ , the default color for red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is good to see in the next section ( together ) . &quot;
&quot; links next to the text is the summar@@ izing column . when differences were found , the color shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , the color is not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , there are white signs only in strings and comments , for the pre@@ ach@@ essor and in few , rare items relevant . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the composition column of the text is interrupted on the points where the respective source file has no lines . if the line switches is activated , the line is shown on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has a info line with the in@@ scription issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ modify &#93; if you edit the result . usually it contains the automatic composite already text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , the store is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find next sol@@ dered / un@@ solved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two comparison can be used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows that the line of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ) This group is then highlighted the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left appears a black beam .
&quot; sometimes , through automatic merge or manually , no more line remains in the group ; then , in these lines of the text &amp; lt ; no line is displayed in the box . this text does not appear either in the final saved file , nor in a mark@@ er you might copy and somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; Con@@ dup@@ lication Con@@ dup@@ lication , however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this feature . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources indicate the options , ignore or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments may be treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates mainly with the ima@@ gery and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are using in one of the window , you can use the arrow buttons on the left , end , end , string and str@@ g end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . click on the default column next to the vertical screen bar . &quot;
&quot; in the Aug@@ abe@@ window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the inser@@ tion button you can switch between inser@@ ting and re@@ writ@@ able mode . ( pre@@ set is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
&quot; one click with the left mouse button , in one of the summar@@ outs columns , syn@@ ced the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section ) and the edi@@ table output window was explained . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( o@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous post ( string image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts may be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the markings to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ inser@@ tion ) . if this enabled , you must mark it automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board and check the manual copy . be careful with this option , because you could not see the content of the cli@@ p@@ board accidentally . &quot;
po@@ len@@ ders are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix versions use a pointer to use \ \ r \ . K@@ illing 3 keeps the pointer of the source files not with it therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored while the next start . ( menu entry &gt; ...
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also poses scripts with variable width to choose from , you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in a short text . if the Scripture does not support this representation , nothing happens at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colours could not be available in its pure form , but would be ex@@ ast@@ ed . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically represents an odd color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , when pressing the tab button the appropriate number of spaces are inserted . otherwise a tab sign is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press the input or return , the down@@ turn of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manually copy into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can select which pointer type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection of the used operating system .
&quot; with the comparisons of files tried &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all can be completely identical lines in source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . the second step is not ignored each line . in this step white signs are not ignored . also in combination , white signs are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a wagon mark@@ er &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a pointer set &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others appear to be different . if this option is activated , the wagon will be visible . if this option is activated , this option has to be de@@ activated . in the default setting this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the pre @-@ setting this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . however , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
in the pre @-@ setting this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
&quot; intensive after even smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and big files , but slowly with very big files . &quot;
&quot; in the Autom@@ atic @-@ rout@@ ing mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will appear before the next un@@ solved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; trig@@ gers automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( pre @-@ set is manual selection . ) This is useful when white signs are less important for all un@@ solved white conflicts in many files . please note that the Autom@@ atic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . &quot;
&quot; these options are treated in chapter to scan , folders and transmis@@ sions . take a look for details under documentation for the directory comparison and the merger . &quot;
&quot; if a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version is displayed the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a back@@ up@@ file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; change the language of user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you must finish &amp; # 3 ; end and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally above the control centre . ) &quot;
&quot; the following code settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you select this option , it is used for all entries the upper setting . &quot;
&quot; about the selection fields for co@@ ding appears a brief reference , which is the local code . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal nature . ) &quot;
&quot; customize the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted as enco@@ ding for each file can be individually adjustable , even can be compared and merged with different co@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which code should be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ editing command , they might not be working with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can handle only 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option one can specify the code of output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
turn this off to sup@@ press releases of changes in white characters in the text or review column . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all the differences between two of three files will be displayed . after selecting A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; B ; C , A &amp; B &amp; D ; C is shown next to the normal nor a second over@@ lap column with the required information . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply drop the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot;
its comparison to each other or another . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you look at the differences and then decide suddenly to perform the files together . a simple click will perform the compilation and uses the fil@@ en@@ ames of the last source file as pre @-@ introduced name for the output file . ( if this feature is used to run it again , then the name of the last used file will be maintained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own preferences , which suit exactly your claims . you can use this function , for example , cut trouble @-@ out parts or correct the rec@@ alling code . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is specified first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used to input this pre @-@ editing command . you can write your own preference code that will have exactly your requirements . each input line must have an associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program itself . however , the good news is however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice . &quot;
use this pre @-@ editing command to convert the input into big letters : sed &apos; s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ \ \ \ \ . \ \ \ . \ \ \ \ . \ \ \ . \ \ U moves the found text in upper case letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some key words to insert automatically generated text box ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you may put these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; ignor@@ ing numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . however , it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for pointer @-@ right . sed &apos; s / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi get deleted . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you might want to perform several points at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; , &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example : &quot;
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something different from e.g. per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / fixing / switches &apos; aller@@ dings are different at per@@ l some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the &quot; &quot; \ \ &apos; . &quot;
the data after normal pre@@ ach@@ essor will be maintained for viewing and execute . the further operations only change the data that the pointer number can only be seen in Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; notice : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the pointer is equal to the normal pre@@ processor &apos;s output as input . &quot;
&quot; the commands commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you can accidentally do not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively and merge together . &quot;
... makes a suggestion for every object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ;
... can this be simul@@ ated and shows the simul@@ ated changes without making them really carry out
... &quot; runs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
&quot; this is very similar to the comparisons , and merge individual files very similar . you only need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; when three folders are assembled , then Ord@@ ner@@ 1 is used as a base . if no target folder has been stated , uses &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts to run it together . to boot that , you need to select the appropriate menu option or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder you will inform a small message window about the current progress . if you break up the folder , only the files are listed until then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
each file and any folder that was found during the scan will be shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded . you can click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the object , or by clicking on the arrow buttons , folders and all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folders and folders . &quot;
&quot; if you click on a file , the file will be started immediately and it appears a comparative window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the assemb@@ ling action cannot be selected automatically . if that will merge together , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; however , the colour is identical , although the age of entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered to be identical , if your entire content is identical . then also folder the same color . with folders , the age is irrelevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours reflect the colors of a leaf@@ let , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the goal , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the goal , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not a : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the goal in case it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; a , B and C do not have the same disk type ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this can not run together . &quot;
... A and B does not have the same disk type ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : errors : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this can not run together . &quot;
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified , and if the option directories are active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the required action so that the two folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge together and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after the output copy &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folder will be merged , then examined &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the exact date appears , then the exact date appears , but the date is identical .. If such mistakes are not fixed , the folder can not be started . &quot;
&quot; during which cras@@ hes , a file will be processed by the other one . it &apos;s status column shows pig@@ let when the result is successfully completed , and according to other messages , if something is completed , you should make a final review and check if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in furnishing dialogue the file comparable method of full analysis is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 further columns will display . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ ves , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts can only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the straight selected entry ( file or Od@@ ds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the assemb@@ ler actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can run it together . &quot;
&quot; note : if you have no target folder , then in the Three @-@ folder mode C , C as the goal is to be chosen , with a two @-@ folder , B and / or B will be used as the target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check whether all entries should be shown in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options by which certain entries may be displayed . check these options to avoid un@@ loving surprises : &quot;
to bring all entries together : select directory tree / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) to perform only the current item or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if through conflic@@ ting data types still exist , a message appears that indicates the faul@@ ty items . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you perform all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options passing through , simul@@ ating and breaking down . &quot;
choose Sim@@ ulation when you want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; Do@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute specific actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) then opens up a composite window ( note the scre@@ enshot ) .
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select again / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved , a corresponding dialogue appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next post continues . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake appears , a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you see some error messages that can help you select the cause of the problem . thus , you have the option to select another promotion for entry or solve the problem in other ways , before proceeding with that . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been made individually , remembers yourself &amp; # 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and execute them together at later , these entries are not being considered . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be re @-@ led again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; Du@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ merger with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree . there are multiple patterns inserted . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; are valid for example * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default setting is * . folder must not correspond to this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree ; it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator signs : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree ; it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator signs : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder @-@ specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file can be adjusted . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a prin@@ cipl@@ ed attribute . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elem@@ ental tree or not . this option is enabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; links to files : if the option is off , symbo@@ lically links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled . &quot;
&quot; on the folder : if the option is switched off , the links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links will be dealt with and recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; B diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ sions will perform and recur@@ sive 3 ; do not cras@@ hes down . ) This option is switched on default . &quot;
&quot; the full analysis of each file leads through and shows statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ ves , un@@ condition@@ ers , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binding analysis , and considerably slower when applied to files that do not contain text . ( enter an appropriate Anti @-@ pattern ) . &quot;
&quot; when you compare a large folder via a long @-@ effective network , it may be quicker to compare only the amendment and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security . please use caution . this option is switched on default . &quot;
&quot; the files will be similar to the Change date . there is no real comparison , if they are equal in size . for example , if when copying the changing date is lost . please use caution . this option is switched on default . &quot;
&quot; in this mode the proposals are compared to and no target sub@@ folder , the proposals to merge together are identical . also , the results are stored by files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered uncertain as it is provided that the other file is not also altered . ) This option is available in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced by another one or deleted , then the original version will be ren@@ amed or er@@ ased . if an old backup file already exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , so it is also associated with additional backup . this option is also switched on the default folder . this option is switched on default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder together remains visible in the sub@@ merge single files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the window directory in the window to switch off the window to the window and switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file by clicking on double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , you can also merge a corresponding menu item directly without the folder menu . once you save the result , the status will be completed and the file will not merge once again when you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost when you read the directory again : list : new to read the directory : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE supports networking more transparent with the help of K@@ IO sl@@ aves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders for opening that are on local or remote computers . &quot;
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP @-@ server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a zi@@ pped archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syn@@ tax than local files and folders . some things should be observed :
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolutely . &quot;
special characters must be mas@@ king . ( # - &gt; % 23 ; spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example has a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . it follows a short list of constraints : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link is displayed to a file or folder . then , a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification of the original from the original . ( note that this is only possible with local files ) ( This is only possible with local files ) . &quot;
&quot; the main purpose purpose is currently as differences @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts at first always the built @-@ in differences . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences , and then select In C@@ ig@@ 3@@ Part Show from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is applied as a part , takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch starts to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ ID 3@@ Part . furthermore , please note that this does not work if none of the original files exist . furthermore , this is uncertain when the original files have changed since the patch file . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it supports only the comparisons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . that &apos;s together or the comparisons of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ illing 2 ( now He@@ ist it comp@@ are ) there are already . besides , the name K@@ illing 3 already indicates that it can bring together as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I use GPL programs for a very long time and have learned much by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have walked this path or go to it .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script might not be communicated to the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default setting configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters are different , these lines will be treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if the lines are next to each other , this ha@@ is , but this is the case of the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor remembers every difference in the files where he begins and where he ends . this is necessary to resolve a conflict by clicking in the source text and selecting the Kno@@ pf@@ es A / B / C , and it is too much effort to design a separate file format which could store this information . &quot;
the effort to do so far has been too big . you can restore a specific version always by choosing a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be used to use another editor .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c has appeared , and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can this be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used a lot of colors to illustrate difference . even more high@@ lighting would be confusing and missing the purpose . use a different editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all features of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; take advantage of , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE please visit the homepage .
you will find a list of recent changes at htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og and the Ch@@ angel@@ og to the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile and install 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; compile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; # 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE gives you the folder in your system , installed in K@@ DE . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf@@ ers and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems during comp@@ iling . nevertheless , difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot;
cut ( str@@ g @-@ X or switching distance ) copies into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . insert ( str@@ g @-@ V or switching unit ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor@@ position and replaces the current markings .
&quot; only differences display : files that are identical in all folders , do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you have to re @-@ read changes to these options the folder with the function Update . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries are displayed , the differences show . this also results that identical files will not be copied in the target folder . if the target file does not already contain these files , they are likely to be revers@@ ed according to the target folder . ) This option is switched on the default folder . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose the source with the description A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed with clicking on the button accordingly . &quot;
in the pre @-@ setting this option is disabled . under@@ differences in individual signs ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual work@@ space . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working surfaces to change its size , stop it or shift it . this works both inside a working space as well as in several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces , as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible in a working space as well as other working surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked , when on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu has only attached the two entries of P@@ ager ... and Be@@ enden . if however , on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context appears and the name of the application as well as the entries are minim@@ ising , on work@@ space and closing . the commands make the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the use window to the full size of the work@@ space . appears only if applied to an application .
sends the application to select virtual work@@ space . appears only if applied to an application .
&quot; this an@@ x@@ box is marked , you can move windows inside the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working surfaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , are in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual work@@ space displayed . &quot;
&quot; crossing this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work@@ space show . it is connected together with name , the names are equipped with folders , &amp; eg ; 1st working space . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the running programs will appear as a small window at the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces are shown to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple spelling with the proportions of the program window . symbol displays the windows with its standard symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program f@@ ender . note : pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be determined : classi@@ fier &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , like for P@@ ager applications in some other window managers are known ; wa@@ agre@@ eable shows all virtual work@@ space in a horizontal row , which is very good for the display on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the Control bar . he has the advantage that he can display in size , display the windows as symbols or with their content and move it . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and they choose to set up a switch ... makes the dialog seem to appear .
&quot; at the moment , this cannot be changed in dialog settings , but you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you have no writing permission for the file , you must register as a user root or login to your system administrator . in this file , you need to register the key win@@ do@@ w@@ ry fashion and assign it to a value . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE package . &quot;

&quot; it may be a very powerful application , which is constantly enhanced by new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines . &quot;
&quot; when you &amp; k@@ likes ; start , a window appears as above . the main window of the screen is described ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . below , this window displays the enlarged form of the screen , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; k@@ likes ; the area around the mouse @-@ cursor like a moving L@@ upe . alternatively , you can be &amp; cold ; to make a selected display area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window ) or the surroundings of the mouse cursor on the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor . please note that &amp; quot ; currently not yet able to detect the form of the mouse cursor . this is always the default file ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window , you can adjust the selection window to your needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can move the content of the enlargement window and move it into the arrow buttons . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally push the &amp; Shift ; taste , or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can post@@ p@@ one the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ window will be fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved . &quot;
&quot; has a lot of features . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , to copy into a file , to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , the image rot@@ ate and much more . &quot;
starts or stopping the update of the ad . the p@@ opp@@ en of the update causes the required CPU time to 0 goes .
&quot; select the Update rate ( Very low , low , means , high ) . the higher the updating rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
in this mode a selection window appears . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; you will automatically use your selected short @-@ command to save files , opening a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ os@@ or ; ) , enlargement and los@@ ers &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; it may also be known as a k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a scre@@ enshot . you can view &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use a range of screen , so you would use a magni@@ fier to use the cl@@ utter in a newspaper or a photo . this application is suitable for different people of use : from the research or artist to the web designer or visual impairment . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates one mouse @-@ click as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor a while on the same place har@@ ps . it is meant to help people suffering the R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and those of each mouse @-@ click pain is prepared .
&quot; and k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates one mouse @-@ click , once the mouse @-@ cursor is mistaken for a while on the same place . it is thought to help people who em@@ ulate the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse @-@ click pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; can handle the pain which comes with clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also seek pain that are linked to using your computer , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it once again : even if &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pain should avoid , which are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that may be caused by using the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse @-@ click away as soon as you break the movement briefly .
&quot; now , the intelligent moving is activated , makes &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; a break after it cras@@ hing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before releasing the mouse button . this way , you can execute the pulling in pressed button . the intelligent moving requires a little practice , but you get used fast to it . &quot;
this denial must be pet@@ ri@@ dden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; one mouse click .
&quot; the time is intelligent moving , the turn@@ around time is switched ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here , the time is set , the &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; after downloading the mouse button wa@@ its before it leaves the mouse button again , if there is no hassle because of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; now supports the click of the mouse button . this function is activated by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow way to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the first time started , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can shor@@ ten &amp; k@@ de ; go to shor@@ ten the reaction times ; go to sound &amp; Multimedia , select there Sound System and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der Sound Pu@@ ffer to shor@@ ten you at a lower value to shor@@ ten the times . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; start with each start by &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; use the respective documentation to rate to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; sets the settings back on the values that were set during opening the dialog . have you already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the status after the last pressures . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; first with the preferences . especially the intelligent moving , you should first be switched off . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can later increase the intelligent shifting . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times by &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral portions of windows or on places in the browser window which does not represent a link , does not pass to unwanted reactions . you can park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse buttons , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into touch with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you must take the mouse ball out . as that happens , your mouse will be different to mouse . it should be clear , however , if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt can easily take you with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ acles Ab@@ kr@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; if it &apos;s just an obli@@ ging process commenced . if you use this case the intelligent moving , means that &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the surgery may no longer end through the slo@@ wing of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution to this problem is that you can perform a mouse @-@ click . below , the status of &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ pool is reset ; and you can continue to work as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and puts the cursor to another passage . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor up there , where you want it . but you don &apos;t want to cause the mouse on a neutral area of the work@@ space , if you don &apos;t want to cause a ke@@ ystro@@ kes . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are un@@ seen . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the front lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent moving , but I do not manage to edit the text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent moving is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; and it needs his time before you can handle it , to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board , or do any other action you want to move into the cli@@ p@@ board mouse button . but there will probably be some advice to them : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent moving , if you just start to start &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; use text instead as follows : execute the mouse button pressed , while you move the mouse @-@ cursor to the other end of the text , and then press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will take every time when &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse @-@ click . thus , you know exactly when with the intelligent shifting time starts . later you can use the intelligent shifting even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise . &quot;
to be able to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; to be used must be the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Win@@ dow ; this should be the case in most systems .
&quot; the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available , when the system has a sound card and speaker , and this is correct . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pressing the mouse as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is briefly distorted . this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome and those who are the actu@@ ation of the buttons .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting that a pulling process begins before the mouse button is let loose . this way also the pulling and insert with the mouse can be performed .

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , using the mu@@ te user to speak their computer for itself . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the course of the conversation , which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left scre@@ enshot ) you enter the command , which will later be used for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the furniture . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text @-@ password . from the text passages you can often choose text passages without typing it . the text passages can be processed naturally . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right scre@@ enshot ) you determine the dictionary for the words of words . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each words . in addition , you can copy the lists of words with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly marked words in the words of words . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the ke@@ ystro@@ kes of your propositions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a publishing storage of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth ; correct , you can enter the input field , you can listen to the input field , which you want to listen . you can select from these propositions which are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings c@@ mouth ; set up ... open the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two maps , voice output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ most supplement , as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the car@@ part map , you enter the command to call the language generators . in the selection field below the input field you place the string enco@@ ding , with the text to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on as the default revision to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; if the text box is not selected , the text will be shared as parameters . you can use the following Plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to the language issue depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . examples are available in Annex . &quot;
&quot; to use as a language service as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the further settings on this page is further developed . the frac@@ tory language service is a stand@@ ardis@@ ed interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection of action after selecting a text passage , determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the menu text pass@@ agent or in the list for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ fort , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and added in addition to the storage field . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is first entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second slot of the editing window , you can specify whether the text @-@ car manual is automatically saved when ordering the editing window . &quot;
&quot; the book will save the book . if you choose any changes , the text @-@ car book is not saved . choose before storing , will be stored &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text @-@ car book is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the page vocabulary contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the vocabulary . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field you can select the current dictionary of vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right side , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , order the order of the books or export them into a file . below the list , you can set the name in the input field and in the selection field the language for dictionary . &quot;
&quot; select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; the frequency of each word is determined simply by paragrap@@ hs of occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
this option allows you to merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask then which dic@@ tion@@ aries are assembled and how they are to be wei@@ ghted .
&quot; this option allows you to create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new entered words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
the main range of the window to edit text @-@ agen@@ e@@ dic@@ tion@@ aries is two @-@ divided . in the upper part the text passages are shown as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected item . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated touch short@@ cut , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions like new text passages or books , or add selected text passages and books you can either reach via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a folding menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text @-@ pass@@ codes or text passages , you can change using mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text will be cut off and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text editor is selected , it will be used , otherwise , the selected areas of the distribution store . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if the text box is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise , the selected areas of the distribution store . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise , the selected propositions of the re@@ tention . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is indicated by default tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default on the editing window , directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another passage . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is enabled , a narrow slope in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed when not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is shown by default for text messages with entries . the Le@@ list is arranged by default on the editing window , directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another passage . &quot;
&quot; probably you have not entered the command for the voice output correctly or not completely inspired . open settings c@@ mouth ; set up , open the page of General settings and enter the command for the voice edition on the map voice output . &quot;
&quot; festival is a language @-@ issue of the University Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ tically supported . the license allows to use the festival free of charge and dissemin@@ ate without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , is believed that festival in the folder / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to the voice output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator . currently , Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator . currently , it only supports the English language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts . the voice @-@ overs are then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched on as the default file . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ gs into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications . &quot;
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to re@@ convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA by accepting that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local RO@@ LA .
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax would like to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore elaborate than in other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ at@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ F _ usr / local RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as a default file must be switched on .
&quot; the voice @-@ issue dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which is available to all &amp; k@@ de ; uses a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ overs systems . &quot;
&quot; since the setting of language generators is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as t@@ kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; for hiring you use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the dialog dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully to use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; cold ; requires about 15 MB storage ) ( and additionally storage for the language generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who cannot speak to the text , which can not be able to use text by the calcul@@ ator . it is stored a list of a pro@@ of@@ ed sentences , which the user can always be re@@ saved again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language @-@ colour contains . on the machine you need to be installed a language thread .

&quot; before you can use , you need to install program speech disp@@ at@@ cher and adjust correctly . &quot;
&quot; at the first start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s or as long as yet no speaker are set up , the car@@ card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the car@@ card is generally displayed . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also various male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variations for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least use a speaker before you set &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise , as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher may otherwise be used for the default speaker . &quot;
different actors for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to that same printer for the same printer .
&quot; click on the car@@ card speaker speaker in k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr , the car@@ card speaker is displayed . this also appears automatically when you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s and yet no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already decorated speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the top speaker will be used for the voice of voice when an application does not present a speaker .
&quot; select a mouse @-@ click on the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; select a mouse @-@ click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; select a mouse @-@ click on the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list below , and the order of the speaker in the list also determines its priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; desktop ; system .
&quot; choose a voting type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and girl &apos;s voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker appears on the car@@ card speaker . to change the settings of this microphone , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ u ; already almost use . go back to the press card , and check if language @-@ overs are activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled , so that the T@@ TS service is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS service is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS service is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to generate text messages . click on the map to create text messages and ad@@ minister . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language file system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map of the card in order to open these hazardous cards . here you can adjust some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts successfully , the carto@@ graphy is displayed , and you can upload and read text messages and read . see . remove the markings , K@@ TT@@ SD will be kept and the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; if k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s is finished , runs &amp; t@@ ts ; next , provided that the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; this an@@ x@@ box marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s appears while reading automatically in the system area of the check@@ bar , it disappears again as soon as the pre @-@ read is complete . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can start text messages , stop , stop and resume . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job . &quot;
&quot; click on application or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all pages . &quot;
the car@@ card orders is shown only when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD and tick K@@ TT@@ SD and tick this voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
&quot; at the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run it . select the text that is to be read and select in the main menu item text . after a short time , the voice @-@ overs should start . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; curtains and other invisible brands are also imagined . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; K@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text posted . first check if &amp; t@@ ts ; run first , then select the text you want to read , and select in the main menu Tools text . then the voice @-@ overs should start . &quot;
this also works if &amp; K@@ ate is embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ os@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; k@@ de ; you will notify you of events specified by you . you can read the text of these messages also from &amp; kt@@ u , read the text of this news . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various types of messages . for example , you can notify you if in a IR@@ C channel appears a message , in which your nickname is found . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C communication text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears in the menu notification noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on application . &quot;
&quot; filter for drawing goods is a good example . it is a good example to fix . it is a good example . you removed the tags b@@ r and b from the news , the mail and also the printing / local / In@@ box , since this can be accepted in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of t@@ ect@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is edited , before it becomes sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for enhancing the pron@@ unciation to select false words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to deal with certain shortcomings of voice and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen re@@ vis@@ ing has the highest priority . it will proceed to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the Screen reader is listed , the checked orders will be continued . &quot;
al@@ arms have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the issue of warning .
news have priority the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can be found here with &amp; k@@ mouth ; aler@@ ts are also messages . read this .
&quot; the rest are simple text messages . each order that you encounter from the car@@ card of orders is a word contract . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications , the text messages used . text messages are intended for issuing longer texts which have no particular urgency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queue , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application reads the output of a screen re@@ aders , during &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ reads , this issue will be stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first , you must know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ funds . you will be applied to regular warnings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News . &quot;
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future it can still be further types of filters .
not@@ ables replace parts of a text by other text . they can specify either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; will provide you with pre @-@ defined string emotional cons such as : - ) by text or for con@@ form@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ duc@@ ers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format ; some X@@ SL@@ T files to translate by &amp; X@@ HTML ; are included in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with speaker op@@ tionally , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , which sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have submitted a female voice for example , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these various filters has adjustable rules , according to which he is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules does not apply , he will keep the text unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a word contract , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; sent on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that are installed on the page below . the processing by the filters is carried out in the order from above down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed in the row from above down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and there will be the further below furniture di@@ alogs . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a list of words or regular expressions , you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . these patterns are exchanged in the text , then the text is exchanged against the associated replacement text . large and lo@@ wer@@ ies is not observed when compared . &quot;
&quot; enter your filter a name for your filter . you can choose any of these names , it just needs to be distinguished from the name of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces him in accordance with the character chain from the column . the list is displayed in the order from above down@@ wards .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; using these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to store or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered , the filter is only applied if the speaker speak one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when clicking on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; you will receive the application ID run programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers , you need to leave it . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you can only enter copies . &quot;
the strings filter is only applied to the text if all conditions deal with an entry in the cast@@ es filter when match . are all input fields blank , the filter is applied to all the texts . &quot;
when compared to words the strings filter regul@@ ators in the form \ \ s Word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ ding characters ( space characters ) .
&quot; in this manual , you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular software &amp; # 160 ; regular press &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular press &amp; # 160 ; Out@@ put you find in the package . &quot;
&quot; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such revers@@ als . it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . however , the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system . &quot;
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient variable path it is also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the spokes@@ man filter you can send the texts to a specific speaker , who is set up on the car@@ card speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can specify , for example , that texts by k@@ mail can be read by a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter indicates , there is a spokes@@ person for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties , which the program is presented , and the characteristics of the speakers are selected . with the speaker op@@ tionally , you can write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value recorded , the filter is applied if the text is applied , if the text contains the deposited regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular press &amp; # 160 ; regular press , you can call this one click on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you place the properties of the desired speaker file . if the text is shown above the filtering conditions , the speaker is selected , which meets the desired requirements most . click on the button on the right to indicate the dialog speaker . &quot;
use these buttons to store or load your speaker settings or delete all settings .
&quot; the spokes@@ man filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the cast@@ es filter , if you apply . you must register at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the voice @-@ overs API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmers can give their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module , with the language used to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so you can use this synthes@@ izer . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; interface of the language output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice services via the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface between &amp; k@@ de ; from the t@@ k@@ ts@@ d program about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; it is the text of the text to read and option a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands please enter
&quot; open two &amp; console ; windows . start only in a window , then k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned langu@@ ag@@ izer supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have created the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Re@@ former@@ filter , but when using the module for festival pages , web pages will not be read . &quot;
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work at all . you &apos;ll also need to do that if you do not have this voice to pre @-@ read web pages . furthermore make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and to be found on the ambient variable path .
&quot; certain characters or plac@@ ements seem to cause errors in synthes@@ iz@@ ers , so all propositions are printed or only Cau@@ ca@@ vities , what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the option character enco@@ ding is set to the right value for the appropriate language . are there problems with specific characters or words , these may be fixed by a string configuration filter . see . &quot;

&quot; the program &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses a customiz@@ able module @-@ architecture for lingu@@ istics . if you want to expand &amp; t@@ ts ; for use of another synthes@@ iz@@ ers , please contact the developer team . &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you refer to the source text of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text archive , or downloaded the menu item you want to download , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ u ; use , first check if speech disp@@ at@@ cher is working properly with your language , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ y@@ pt SPD conf@@ . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ u ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.@@ 4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr is supposed to be developed , so that the establishment of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script of the SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can res@@ ign pro@@ posi@@ tional or down@@ time , repeat the output stop or break down . &quot;
&quot; if an application text is attached to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have created an application of the preferred microphone , the language is English and its gender female , this one , otherwise , the best matching speaker can be chosen . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; one speaker selected , see you in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Add click Add to add a speaker to the list or click on Edit , the car@@ dium speaker device is shown . as an example , details of the module for festival Interactive is shown . details of the modules can be found under . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in the path , you only need to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the string enco@@ ding for text , which is delivered to Festival . by voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; generally , this setting is made automatically . generally applicable , that Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages like Czech or Slov@@ ak are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you put volume , cross @-@ level speed and pitch @-@ height of synthetic language . if you cannot select some controller and display this grey , the voice lets you choose to do these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size , these voices are already loaded during the launch of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with large memory consumption ) the first sentence is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this an@@ x@@ box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or do not forget to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; this an@@ x@@ box is marked , is displayed at the start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr of the program window , but not the program window appears , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; this sign @-@ box marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system range , once K@@ TT@@ SD will read a text . this gives you the possibility to keep the pre @-@ read or control it . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the just processed sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the car@@ card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can print a double room on behalf , which is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on OK , all changes of settings ( also on the other car@@ card maps ) are taken over and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this symbol to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead Al@@ sa , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the Kar@@ tei@@ Card Audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here are only text messages listed and managed . issues of screen re@@ porters , warnings and messages are not displayed . more information about the communication types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; can be found here . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , t@@ ect@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audi@@ om@@ o@@ du@@ l or t@@ ect@@ ts ; the necessary libraries can not load . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . have you choose Al@@ sa , choose the PC@@ M device . see also &quot;
&quot; place the intercom speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % approximately the double standard intercom speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x . &quot;
&quot; on apply , you can apply to the new settings for the current &amp; desktop ; system . &quot;
the list of al@@ sa devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device is working with you . in doubt you choose standard .
&quot; on this map , you can set special actions that will always be executed when the text contract is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of voice orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen re@@ vis@@ ing has the highest priority . it will proceed from all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the Screen reader has been presented , the checked orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
al@@ arms have priority the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning .
&quot; news have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the news . if you are looking for a long text on a website , you can come with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome you to enter the room . &quot;
&quot; if a word contract is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in queue for a long time . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played when a normal word contract is interrupted . if both introductory sound and introductory message is active , the introductory sound is played in front of the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this mapping will only apply to normal text messages . for messages , warnings and issues of screen re@@ funds , there is no special actions if it will be interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages can be read , run k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the noti@@ fications noti@@ fications appears . &quot;
&quot; highlight this check box to turn the pre @-@ read by &amp; k@@ de ; this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are disabled and t@@ ect@@ ts ; do not read aler@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , noti@@ fications , in which a sound is played , from &amp; kt@@ ly ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or to delete it . if you click on the button Add , a dialog appears in which you want to add the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; if someone is mentioned in a IR@@ C message your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list is nothing else stated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
use this selection field to set what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event arrives . you have the following selection options :
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following Plac@@ eholder : &quot;
you can enter here the features of the desired speaker . default choose the speaker displayed in the list on the car@@ card speaker as a top entry . see it also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if for a specific event of a specific application , it is executed . otherwise , the action applies to all other events of the specific application . otherwise , the action is specified for all other events of the specific application . as a last option comes the action to carry out the standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
the event All aler@@ ts for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can specify the noti@@ fications noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the button save to save the settings for the noti@@ fications into a file . use the button shop to load stored settings from a file . if you want to begin with an empty list , click on Dele@@ te . all entries except for fin@@ ches are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a voice output . this standard contains marks for the control of voices , the speaker speed , volume , the sex of voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation by example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) as this is the standard vote that uses the Festival in the SS@@ ML edition .
&quot; if the settings for speed or audio situation in the Festival Con@@ figuration did not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous spoken . &quot;
&quot; &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; &quot; htt@@ p / / D@@ T@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / D@@ T@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / D@@ T@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / D@@ T@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / D@@ T@@ D / / D@@ T@@ D / / D@@ T@@ D / / h / speech : who has slept in my bed ? asked the B@@ ären@@ kind . &#93; &#93; &gt; &quot;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . SB@@ Ds can start reading text into individual sentences . this can also proceed &amp; t@@ opping ; faster with the pre @-@ reading order , since only the first sentence has to be syn@@ ced or stop or stop and break down , even if the language of the language are not directly supported . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the statutes of the filter filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; a pro@@ vision@@ ing filter filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings , or add another set @-@ off filter , but will get off from it . &quot;
&quot; in the easiest way you learn the setup of inter@@ pol@@ ation by choosing . switch off the speaker selection , please change some features and check how the selection of the speaker can be modified . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; then quick to start reading , as only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you can then stop or break down scripts on the car@@ dinal @-@ board orders , even if the language of the language used this function is not supported . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter is automatically set up , if you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just removed . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
&quot; set @-@ by filter compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the statutes , are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter maintains the character composition . &quot;
&quot; SB@@ D @-@ Filter will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ funds . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter , you can insert it again by adding the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file in the t@@ ect@@ or@@ c . &quot;
on the car@@ part map Spe@@ ak selection you can write the speaker settings for the application . the car@@ card is shown if
use of the default ( the top on the car@@ card speaker ) . in other words : no spokes@@ person shall be defined .
&quot; the use of the most suitable speaker , which displays all the features of an equipped speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , the speaker , which is the most originally made properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection heads .
&quot; select the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this feature does not play a role , you don &apos;t give anything . &quot;
highlight this check box if the property shall prevail over other properties . you can also put a number of marks here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output is , it is always treated as a priority property . the only case where you might want to specify this property . the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language , is , if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than that in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the field speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default button of the standard speaker , and then use the speaker , which is most likely to be listed below . &quot;
in this case 0 for the last text list is available in queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input is required ) .
&quot; k@@ tt@@ sm@@ ack cras@@ hes immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not get back@@ tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is cras@@ hed and t@@ ect@@ ts ; it was finished . probably , you need to register G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not solved in this case , you may not be compatible with a compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output of al@@ sa does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I hold a word contract , free@@ zes &amp; t@@ ame ; a message appears , saying , &quot; &quot; to open PC@@ M &quot; . &quot; &quot;
on your system there is the problem that conflicts with al@@ sa occur which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the Al@@ sa project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I downloaded an extra voice for Festival from the Internet . I installed it and can &apos;t use it in the festival but k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
&quot; add in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / pointing the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the map of audio there is an adjustment speed . so that this works , the program so@@ x will be installed and about the ambient variable path . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed up . depending on the chosen voice , this active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the intercom speed is ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( see if you are fully courageous to change the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are totally gr@@ ace@@ fully , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ transm@@ itter filter and set up the intercom speed . &quot;
&quot; I do not make sure that websites can be read with a female voice . I have created a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able gender does not seem to work . this festival does not produce errors that thro@@ ws the x@@ s@@ l file to converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber @-@ tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
&quot; I have added a own character chain filter filter and now I can go back - or go back . on the car@@ dinal orders is displayed , the order best@@ owed just out of a sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation ( point , frac@@ ture , exclusion , comm@@ a , and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) , you are not allowed to filter . use for these characters instead a filter for the pro@@ posi@@ tional detection . &quot;
al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . please note that the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by calling before the use of G@@ exten@@ sion@@ in &amp; kt@@ ts ; the command G@@ ST @-@ register . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org ) &quot;
&quot; some users experience in connection with al@@ sa conflicts in the audio issue . if your system is also counted , you can not simultaneously stop playing music and start a text . &amp; t@@ ts . also , free@@ zes up . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of Al@@ sa ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; in July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you stop a word contract in &amp; kt@@ u ; stop , the current sentence will still be read . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general adjustment of the intercom speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Debian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; have you downloaded &amp; t@@ ball ; as a tar@@ ball ( with tar packed archive ) , register as normal users and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a matching folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; charts ; probably removed or at least just created on request . &quot;
&quot; the following modules for voice @-@ boards are created by default . some of them possess a run @-@ dependent of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the directives of the Debian distribution ) . the column option for shut@@ down of the display shows the configure parameter , which causes the passing of the creation . &quot;
&quot; as default , this folder is not listed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR@@ S , you have to specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . &quot;

&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , first check if your voice works correctly works . follow the instructions you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ izer , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can set volume , intercom speed and pitch . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions provided with Festival . want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on transmission . &quot;
this voice uses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage stage . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / Main / Russian / . if you set up the Russian voices you have to enter for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a cy@@ ril@@ lic ( 8 @-@ Bit@@ - ) enco@@ ding like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
&quot; festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions , therefore , look for the first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 option . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the code must be adjusted to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ isch such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ iz@@ ers the le@@ xi@@ al analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; votes can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice file system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival generates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German texts Di@@ phone . for more information please refer to .
&quot; with this method , additional wr@@ apper code will be added to the festival to use the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; for instructions , but in the folder Festival / lib / . instructions can be found under &quot;

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; controller center , enabling the management of network interfaces , rout@@ ing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . it can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , like other settings from the &amp; control centre ; creating a simple surface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; controller center ; it can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware does not install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is displayed at all and allows the setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed on installing &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . network devices may be added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files , corresponding to the core version . &quot;
&quot; the module network settings is loaded , if the option is selected to detect network settings in the &amp; controller center ; index is selected . when launching the module network settings , this one tries to detect the platform on the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the most important selection is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that will best meet the distribution and release version . by flag@@ ging the adjustment Not @-@ again @-@ asking the definition may be made permanently . the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically set . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are grey , which means , changing settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system administration system , you will be able to access the button @-@ management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is the input of the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three Reiter : &quot;
the tab network interfaces is used for managing network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces you can perform the following tasks :
&quot; setup settings can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list , and click on the button to set up ... in the dialog device . &quot;
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the button , click the dialog with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the choice Autom@@ atically , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode the TCP / IP information is needed for the system at the same time . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server will send all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further adjustment can be required . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , are selected . &quot;
with the selection manual can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP address . in the input field IP address must be specified in the input field .
&quot; if this setting is marked , initi@@ alizes the system interface with the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network will not be used . by entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or activated depending on the need . switching of an added network device can be activated by selecting from the list and click on the interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off on demand . switch off an active network device by selecting from the list and click on the interface to disable ...
&quot; the IP address of the computer is fixed in the local sub@@ net , which provides the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if on the computer there is more than one network interface , the interface to the net is to be selected in which the gateway computer is selected . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name . this is necessary because computers can only be able to understand IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the computer trig@@ gers this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
the calcul@@ ator for nam@@ esp@@ ace part of the equ@@ est@@ rian name solution allows easy management of this list . entries may be added to or modified wer@@ .@@ DNS entries can be arranged through selection of a tra@@ y and execution or de@@ code in the list with the buttons or stro@@ kes up in the priority .
&quot; by clicking the button &quot; &quot; Add ... &quot; &quot; from the group machine to nam@@ esp@@ ace can add a DNS server . it will add the dialog new name server . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry will be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; out of the group machine for naming resolution , select an entry and then click the button Edit .... It will display the dialog Edit . &quot;
&quot; the list including known machines describes machine @-@ to @-@ IP address notes for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily with boats when no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains notably known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still occurs in the test version of IP should be replaced in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP @-@ address of the well @-@ known machines and click Add .... The dialogue New Ali@@ as is displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known machines and click the button Add . if the known computer has multiple alias names , de button add several times and enter the further ali@@ as names . &quot;
select an entry of a specially known machines from the list and select Edit .... The dialog box will be processed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then by clicking on OK the list of static hosts is updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings done in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , must be placed in a &amp; console ; the following command will be dis@@ assembled . &quot;
&quot; the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source text . &quot;
&quot; for installing the binary distri@@ butions ( mostly r@@ pm packages ) it is enough , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm package and install in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphi@@ cally surface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this event , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and others are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ ke ; to compile . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology is given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ s are discussed ; modify configuration files are discussed . &quot;
&quot; this area may not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC in a small ( home ) network is conve@@ yed . &quot;
IP networks with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) is never found large distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore currently focused on widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator at the contact address , which is a valid IP address or if available , can not be chosen as D@@ H@@ CP . &quot;
&quot; when throwing an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from an especially reserved area for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , hence it is possible to use any use . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
for smaller networks mostly addresses in the area of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 is used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computer participants are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things 0,@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the standard route is required for the IP management . &quot;
the PS@@ U 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
&quot; in this part there are the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynam@@ ically changed at DSL connections , so that it is not surprised if in the case of active DSL connections , another content than set there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config file . another stand as expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application that allows you to run other programs after a timetable in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ; system program cr@@ on .
&quot; when starting &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you will see a list already included tasks and corresponding ambient variables . when you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this appears both for all users of the system and system internal tasks . each folder can be up and folded . &quot;
&quot; in a de@@ activated task , program name and parameters are not displayed and under description will be disabled . &quot;
the variables available here are the otherwise existing ambient variables for all listed tasks except power . with a de@@ activated variable appears as a description disabled .
&quot; to create a new task , select first the tasks &quot; folder . go then in the menu to Edit New .... Altern@@ atively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the folders folder , and then press C@@ tr@@ l ; N press . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the lead program . you can either specify a relative or an absolute name . if you want to search the program first , you can select .... &quot;
&quot; select the minute ( s ) to which the task should be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , you can specify the minutes in five steps . &quot;
&quot; if you specify both mon@@ day and week@@ day ( s ) as well as week@@ day ( s ) , the programme will be executed on the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the programme will be executed independently of the week@@ day , and also on every Sunday of the months , no matter what date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only be active when the cr@@ on@@ tab was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a task , select it first to remove the problem . go to editing . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the task and select one or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; X . &quot;
&quot; to copy a task , select first the task to copy it . go to editing copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the task and select copy , or push C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;

&quot; if all tasks and ambient variables were inserted or modified , you still have to save the cr@@ on@@ tab . choose the menu item saving . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . change or supplements to tasks or variables are only then active . &quot;
&quot; it appears the default file . in case you select , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in print dialog . &quot;
prints the cr@@ on@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible for users to have extended cre@@ denti@@ als .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example vi@@ xie cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command cr@@ on@@ tab to change the schedules of the user . &quot;
&quot; a P@@ OS@@ IX compliant &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX , to experience time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat files ; is a backup program for belt drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar , which presented the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to a quick , selective un@@ pack . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife was : how much longer it takes you to secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be involved from &amp; k@@ dat files . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat : let the band return and reads the pre @-@ voltage information of the tape . realize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ spell on the tape are not , you will be asked if the band is form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ diction , searches it according to the appropriate index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ Index is to be created . &quot;
&quot; everything has gone smoothly , the symbol is changing for the band@@ age to indicate that the band is involved . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for the tape through out @-@ out of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the ban@@ des , first the incorpor@@ ation must be solved first . there are three methods to achieve this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; indicates a change of the symbol for the band , that the integration of the band has been solved and displays a message in the status bar . the band can now be ki@@ cked out without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a strap can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a band@@ age must form@@ at@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting when you are form@@ at@@ ted before use , this must be done before you are form@@ at@@ ted from the tape of &amp; k@@ dat files . flo@@ ppy drives usually do not put a form@@ atting of the belt , DAT drives on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the tape , all the data on the tape are lost automatically and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the required files . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or a folder in the local file tree . it is only saved this file or the folder .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are saved .
highlight files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu Si@@ des ...
&quot; once the backup has been opened , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog backup will appear . dialogue will show the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
highlight a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or the folder .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . there will be only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the test process has been started , the dialog settings for review . in this dialog you can check out your selection and change the work@@ ings for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears to review . this dialog displays the progress of the test process as well as the data transfer and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the re @-@ establish , the files that should be recovered , marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives which belong to the entry for the band@@ age . it is restored only the selected file or sub@@ folder .
highlight the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . it only restored the selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu entry ...
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work@@ ings for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , dialogue will be re @-@ establish . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data set and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes it proves to be necessary to re@@ create the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file using the belt content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the tape : &quot;
&quot; here , a backup profile will be created with the just marked files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
&quot; the current working folder , in which the backup should be made . the list of security files is automatically updated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; for all folders , which are listed under backup files , that only the files stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folder that are stored on other fil@@ esystem , you can register separately under security files . each entry is viewed by tar independently of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file will be used . only the files saved that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before the call of tar . this causes all the files to be secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons are measured ; and lt ; lt ; files was yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can set you up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device driver for the band@@ age ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ re@@ viewing variant of the belt device .
&quot; if this setting is active , conve@@ yed &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated the load goes to the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the throw in the belt drive . possibly this attitude does not work with all band@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , when solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat files ; automatically the belt ki@@ cked off . use this option not with flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ es@@ ei@@ ghty block size for belt drive . not all drives support variable block@@ sizes . whether this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band@@ age . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat files ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file at the beginning of the belt . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; n Byte ) The Band ID . the format of this string is calcul@@ ator : seconds , with the computer name of the full name of the system is form@@ at@@ ted on which the tape has been form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time in which the band has been form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file named $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat files using the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work so long as it is not an incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup system . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&quot; the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where to get information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files , or where the system allows for quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , which cannot know where to get information about your system or where the system is deposited with the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; moreover , &amp; k@@ system log ; experienced users with quick access to information on issues that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions , with whose help the protocol files are fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; k@@ system log ; a number of useful features include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the scre@@ enshot photo , &amp; k@@ system log ; features available , with whose help the single protocol @-@ lines of a protocol file can be easily fil@@ tered and sor@@ ting . the individual possibilities for sor@@ ting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after starting &amp; k@@ system log ; first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system prot@@ ok@@ oll - to open it , so you have a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system log ; very likely not with system administration right . the protocol files usually do not find any permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filtering bar to filter after a selected criterion , or according to the log chains . in default , the selection field contains next to the filter entry . in default , a protocol line contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string string is included . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also select another entry . the string of the filter search@@ engine will then only be assigned with the entries in the appropriate column . select for example in the filtering bar the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system log ; all the protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of level errors are displayed with a con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous color as protocol @-@ lines of level indication . the colored representation of protocol @-@ lines can be switched from dialog .
&quot; if you want to display only certain process ( e.g. in the system prot@@ oc@@ at@@ oll or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . for example , it may be useful when you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the launch of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use Filter@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to new lines jump in the context menu of the main window to display all the new record protocol . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and ad@@ minister . once you have chosen a sub@@ window , select a protocol on display in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. we find further up @-@ to @-@ date information on the supply sources of &amp; k@@ system log ;
&amp; k@@ system log ; can also be found in the following folder of &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archiving : k@@ system log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; - Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it editor just known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section guides some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
&quot; the System V In@@ it rapidly develops into the standard for the control of the program start @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world , because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I know about it myself ) : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installation and new format . therefore , you must ensure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was there . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it , and the following more folders : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to boot the system or when switching to another run@@ time . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set , that will only be started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems also own this file , even if it does not want much use for it . you can also want to run a r@@ c.@@ in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial connection . &quot;
the kernel looks at different places according to the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the standard run level is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the pre @-@ provided Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can fix something , then you come to fix it by re@@ boot the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how do you start all the right scripts ? if you want to enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that in this folder you do not find the right files . instead , each entry here is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each scrip@@ ting is so written , that it &apos;s an argument like start and stop accepted . you can actually start the scripts in hand on the command line as follows : &quot;
&quot; this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one includes , the script will be called on stop . if it includes a S , the script will be called start with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way of set machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server running @-@ level that leaves just htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
&quot; the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another sign device is simple to not say trivial : simply draw an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running level to start it on this level ( or stop ) . &quot;
&quot; you can also move the scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within one level , removing it elsewhere . this will only happen if they draw an entry from the field of availability system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are postponed when you drag them into a new section . to insert them only on a new run@@ down menu , you must explicitly select the menu item or from the context menu -- even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of an application can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you must edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again , add the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently there is no possibility to restore entries , which were thrown into the trash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab key to enable the different work@@ ings ( Av@@ ail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) and the cursor buttons to meet a selection of top or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to post@@ p@@ one an entry into another run@@ down level , move it with cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of a entry manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . use the tab button to accept the changes , or push m@@ c to throw the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of loss loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre @-@ settings are taken the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise they will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts continually new . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the standard running level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) . &quot;
&quot; I have some system services provided with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way , how system services can be launched in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately , the configuration for the proprietary furnishings of these distri@@ butions , corresponds to no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution : please check if all configuration files are available ( and , whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply end up without message , if their configuration files are not available or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the running level to allow this manual to be added . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you made changes , you need to save them . either use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry in the menu file . &quot;
&quot; the main window is a simple application . the main window consists of two car@@ cards , the user and the user group list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties . &quot;
&quot; some post@@ cards are only represented if you have enabled more advanced settings . only if you are creating space restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users will be created , on which you can make individual settings . further post@@ cards appear , in case shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; the ticket office appears , in case shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; this mapping card appears only , if for at least one @-@ file fil@@ esystem ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here you can modify parameters for each user where the limited restrictions are available in KB : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field fil@@ esystem .
&quot; the car@@ dinal @-@ card groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the field Prim@@ acy group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by highlight them in the big box . &quot;
&quot; the dialog &apos;s dialog contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group or click on the appropriate add button of tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works an@@ alogue . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the L@@ ILO boot manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time until the boot of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change operating systems , change , change , change , change . &quot;
