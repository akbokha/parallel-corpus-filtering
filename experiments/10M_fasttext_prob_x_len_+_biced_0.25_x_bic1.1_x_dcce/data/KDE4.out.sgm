<seg id="401">"Anstat can play with the controls mentioned above, you should use the color temperature-ppette. press on this button and then anywhere in the image to calculate the color temperature of the white-comparison. this way the temperature and green values are automatically set."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white off with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. you will display the combined result in the white color. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture.</seg>

<seg id="406">"you can adjust here the encoding stiff per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely spread JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high quality images. this code also needs more disk space, computing time and stands onlyfor the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">"this tool opens the same dialog like the processing of raw material. it uses the change and assignment of colour profiles. colour mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the use of colour profiles. a detailed guide for the use of colour profiles can be applied to the chapters of color administration."</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors tonlasty and allows you to use multiple color channels at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or scanners can always make the same mistake and you can always need the same correction. in the manual for toning corrections you find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for the gradation that you can find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & D came; tool Farming effects provides you four colour effects, a solar-effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a channel filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also called Sabatier, an effect of being created by the added light. this had the effect that the hellish areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. this tool was a part negative of the picture. this tool allows you to finalize this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar zation. at about 50% intensity, the image shows what chemically possible is possible. another upsurge finally generates a negativity that is not produced on photopapier."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar energy efficiency. the original image is the (1) and edit the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation that makes it a stronger contrast-effect that makes the colors brilliant and smooth. try it easy to embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for one on daylight optimized color movie created by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and with it a reference for his smooth image structure. Velvet offers very saturated colours but also some photographs of photographers - especially those which hardly differ landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of result and the slider repeat the strength of the neonlichts. at large pictures, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color contraast and the luminosity of the photos. you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools at preview. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the opposite problem: one too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation can be a good choice to reduce saturation. all changes you can perform in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes made with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool Gradation and the simple luminosity / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialogue is very complicated for this tool, you need only the area of the slider. concrete the three slider below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of Intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph there are three sliders into the inside and which can be moved to change the intensification of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>

<seg id="480">"sharpens is a traditional tool for edge. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, granates images."</seg>
<seg id="481">Sharpen mask works on the contrast of edges to look at an image sharpens. in fact it's not a bit it works rather psychopuell. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it's here a really good job. the algorithm has been taken out of Gimp and he is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three because he really improves the sharpness. he is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as the most digitalized pictures need a correction of the sharpness. this in turn leads to a common color combined with just minimal difference to a color point. this in turn leads to a common color printed. SLR cameras normally need more bearable sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG images, a camera has often been applied to internal sharpness. on the other hand, images in the shell must always be sharpened during the processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner contact a sharpness filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable it, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can obtain useful results by sharpen a photo with the field of field of sharpness. this allows you to call the menu entry of correcting sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="487">"but you should deal with caution, because the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of edges, but also amplified the noise. in general, the most useful technique to raise an image the tool Refocused. among refocus you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too tight. the solution to draw the picture a little soft, is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool for softness with the menu entry fee, and experiment something with settings. the preview on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help the image to edit. the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values are often good results, and should first be tried out. an increase in radius or the amount amplify the effect. if you make the immeasurly mask to be strong, noise and impression of grats are produced near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">"the radius shows how many pixels are affected by the filter at each side of a channel. high-resolution images allow greater radios. therefore, they should be able to raise pictures of the best in its final resolution."</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blatted image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swan value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. this way, a minimum difference can be used for a canter of filters. in this way areas with a soft shift between the tones of sharpen is excluded and therefore beauty error in the faces, Himmler and water-surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the converted image (2). unsharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swan value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & D came; tool refocus is focused on an image by improving the sharpness. it used to be used by copyright protected by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to revert a picture & quot; refocused quot; in which it's better approach than just trying the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna Filtering. it is using a technique called FIR Vienna Filtering. you can often launch better results as unsharp mask. you can start it out of the menu by drawing colors refocus in the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular Faltung works much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche's Faltung has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical outcome also from the original pixel rate. the FIR Muninverse the Gauß'schen Faltung, in most cases, is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixel. this causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular Faltung. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. you can set a higher value if your image should be very blurred but then refer to Heiligenpons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"smoking filter: an increase in the smoking filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 is only rarely useful. if the smoking filter can be too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor. a high value is 0.03. a high value will be added to the image even further."</seg>
<seg id="502">"gauge's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter if your insharper Gauß is caused. in most cases, you should use this value to 0, to avoid annoying artifacts. in most cases, you should use this value to 0, to avoid annoying artifacts. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 so you may also increase the correlation and / or the robbery filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrim size: this value determines the size of the transformational size. an increase in the matchsize can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpening or the Gaudi's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow when you choose large values for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"the storing and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each of any refocus parameters you have set will be saved for later, and can then be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all the cutting, color and Intensive encores on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible are left but later left unpleasurable artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you want to read and compress the images, & eg; as JPEG, you should use the module to the unzipped image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp measles produces better results than cutting. this could be caused by blurred masking a bigger neighborhood as a sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, unsharp masquerying must always remove artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never let the effect of sharpened filters. practically the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always just as good as the unsharpened mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better with the processing of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused picture:"</seg>

<seg id="1043">Povray uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally speaking pictures with this property are better off.</seg>
<seg id="1044">"when you turn off anti-aliasing, and connects & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard, an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because every pixels is continually expanded again and adaptive because every pixels depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam per pixel. if the difference between the colours to the neighboured pixel rate, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the lowering value at 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a lowering of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays depending on pixels."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays depending on the pixels. if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre-determined threshold, then the pixels is divided into 4 sub-pixels that can be followed separately and can be checked for further underdistribution. the maximum depth of recursion can be adjusted with the lowering value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of smokers for the beam process, called jittering. if you turn jittering, changes & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental characteristic of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection calculates. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>

<seg id="1520">'--Preset Medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should normally offer for most people and most musical pieces of acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo-fi systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good genug for music of young people, portable devices and autoimmune facilities. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated to most people and most environments, but if you definitely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this option."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information, manually entered or transmitted by the program automatically from the freeDB via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / needed to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with codierprograms, there is often a combination of programmes for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the aid to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD (English: day) when MP3s are coded with lame (English: day) if MP3s must be added with lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; the outcome looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>

<seg id="1533">"in many countries, there are copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; set up for use of freeDB, the geographically closest to the next reflection will be needed. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org supplies a current list of mirror servers for the online call of & CD. alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) just the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which exclusiveness is used to save pieces from the & CD in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that is used to know cdparanoia; who wants to know more exact, search in source code....

<seg id="1537">"to save the loaded WAV files, the encoders and hence the desired file format can be chosen. at the first Open are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss of pressing for audio data) on the tab for inserting the code. other encoders can be added at this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoding package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the encoding can be used. this is also required for the predefined code of code. more information about Kodiers are found in the chapter Welcher Kodiers.</seg>

<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as is their presence. therefore, you must create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use several names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to make notes on the perk-channel channel. take a look at the supplied keymaps.</seg>

<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM provides that a keyboard, which is to play a pitch-in-event with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, try some keyboards to play two notes up to a octave. to try to try the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; around."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">"the channel view is a window with a whole range of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you see, which sounds are just played."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selective list where you have changed a instrument. if you have changed a instrument, the button is no longer green but red, to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to view the played sounds. view in the menu settings under the point channel view: settings</seg>

<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc. thus, the same MIDI file may result on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can't force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2084">Local elements pose a personal collection of web developers for a single user. they are user-specific patterns and tools. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>

<seg id="2498">"and kmousetool; emulates one mouse-click, once the mouse-cursor is mistaken for a while on the same place. it is thought to help people who emulate the repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and those of each mouse-click pain. furthermore, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. this requires a little practice."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"& kmousetool; can handle the pain which comes with clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also seek pain that are linked to using your computer, if this is not yet done."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"to clarify it once again: even if & kmousetool; pain should avoid, which are caused by clicking with the mouse, it is against pain that may be caused by using the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & moumousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse-click away as soon as you break the movement briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"now, the intelligent moving is activated, makes & kmousetool; a break after it crashing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement, before releasing the mouse button. this way, you can execute the pulling in pressed button. the intelligent moving requires a little practice, but you get used fast to it."</seg>
<seg id="2503">This denial must be petridden after the end of the mouse movement before & moumousetool; one mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">"the time is intelligent moving, the turnaround time is switched (1 / 10 s) is active. here, the time is set, the & moumousetool; after downloading the mouse button waits before it leaves the mouse button again, if there is no hassle because of the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="2505">"& kmousetool; now supports the click of the mouse button. this function is activated by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow way to the left and back leads a double-click. these movements are started in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool; the first time started, but can be changed later."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"when the sound is delayed, you can shorten & kde; go to shorten the reaction times; go to sound & Multimedia, select there Sound System and here the rider General. there is a slider Sound Puffer to shorten you at a lower value to shorten the times."</seg>

<seg id="2509">"best use & kmousetool; first with the preferences. especially the intelligent moving, you should first be switched off. if you then click on the automatic mouse click, you can later increase the intelligent shifting."</seg>
<seg id="2510">"if you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times by & kde; in case of sounds."</seg>
<seg id="2511">"first, you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral portions of windows or on places in the browser window which does not represent a link, does not pass to unwanted reactions. you can park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again."</seg>
<seg id="2512">"if your mouse buttons, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into touch with the mouse ball."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"first, you must take the mouse ball out. as that happens, your mouse will be different to mouse. it should be clear, however, if you look at the bottom of the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"when you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and the dirt can easily take you with a flat blade or the fingernacles Abkratzen."</seg>
<seg id="2515">"in very rare situations, the operating system breaks the execution of & moumousetool; if it's just an obliging process commenced. if you use this case the intelligent moving, means that & kmousetool; the surgery may no longer end through the slowing of the mouse button."</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"the solution to this problem is that you can perform a mouse-click. below, the status of & moumousetpool is reset; and you can continue to work as usual."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"problem: if you enter text, tries & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and puts the cursor to another passage."</seg>
<seg id="2519">"solution: use the mouse to place the cursor up there, where you want it. but you don't want to cause the mouse on a neutral area of the workspace, if you don't want to cause a keystrokes. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are unseen. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the front lines of windows."</seg>
<seg id="2520">"I try to work with the intelligent moving, but I do not manage to edit the text."</seg>
<seg id="2521">"the intelligent moving is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it needs his time before you can handle it, to copy it into the clipboard, or do any other action you want to move into the clipboard mouse button. but there will probably be some advice to them:"</seg>
<seg id="2522">"do not use the intelligent moving, if you just start to start & kmousetool; use text instead as follows: execute the mouse button pressed, while you move the mouse-cursor to the other end of the text, and then press the mouse button again."</seg>
<seg id="2523">"use the audible mouse click. this will take every time when & kmousetool; the mouse button pushes a sound like a mouse-click. thus, you know exactly when with the intelligent shifting time starts. later you can use the intelligent shifting even without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise."</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; to be used must be the XTest extension for & X Window; this should be the case in most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">"the functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available, when the system has a sound card and speaker, and this is correct."</seg>

<seg id="2931">"if this setting is active, conveyed & kdat; before the tape is integrated the load goes to the drive. with some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed."</seg>

<seg id="2941">"& ksystem log; helps users understand what your computer is in the background. the task of & ksystem log; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, which cannot know where to get information about your system or where the system is deposited with the different protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"moreover, & ksystem log; experienced users with quick access to information on issues that occur on their server. & ksystem log; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions, with whose help the protocol files are filtered and evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 & ksystem log; a number of useful features include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the screenshot photo, & ksystem log; features available, with whose help the single protocol-lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorting. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after starting & ksystem log; first the most important protocol-file of the system - the system protokoll - to open it, so you have a small message window, so you have & ksystem log; very likely not with system administration right. the protocol files usually do not find any permission to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filtering bar to filter after a selected criterion, or according to the log chains. in default, the selection field contains next to the filter entry. in default, a protocol line contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string string is included."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"of course, you can also select another entry. the string of the filter searchengine will then only be assigned with the entries in the appropriate column. select for example in the filtering bar the name of a process, so show you & ksystem log; all the protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol-lines of level errors are displayed with a conspicuous color as protocol-lines of level indication. the colored representation of protocol-lines can be switched from dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only certain process (e.g. in the system protocatoll or in the cron protocol), so you can examine the process identification (PID) in the column process. for example, it may be useful when you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the launch of the samba server. in this case, use Filterbar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can jump the option to new lines jump in the context menu of the main window to display all the new record protocol."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystem log; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and administer. once you have chosen a subwindow, select a protocol on display in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystem log; has its own website on http: / / ksystem log.forum-software.org. we find further up-to-date information on the supply sources of & ksystem log;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystem log; can also be found in the following folder of & kde; Subversion archiving: ksystem log; in & kde; - Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init editor just known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section guides some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the System V Init rapidly develops into the standard for the control of the program start-up of the system in the & Linux; world, because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further here on historical aspects (e.g. because I know about it myself): -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine on System V Init, without a reinstallation and new format. therefore, you must ensure that the old init was removed from there if there was there."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init, that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder called rc.sysinit, and the following more folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to boot the system or when switching to another runtime. system services include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as set, that will only be started. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be on the one hand under / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems also own this file, even if it does not want much use for it. you can also want to run a rc.in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places according to the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard run level is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the pre-provided Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can fix something, then you come to fix it by reboot the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how do you start all the right scripts? if you want to enter -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder you do not find the right files. instead, each entry here is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each scripting is so written, that it's an argument like start and stop accepted. you can actually start the scripts in hand on the command line as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one includes, the script will be called on stop. if it includes a S, the script will be called start with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way of set machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server running-level that leaves just httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc;, network & etc;, network & etc;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"the use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another sign device is simple to not say trivial: simply draw an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running level to start it on this level (or stop)."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move the scripts between Runleveln or change the position within one level, removing it elsewhere. this will only happen if they draw an entry from the field of availability system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are postponed when you drag them into a new section. to insert them only on a new rundown menu, you must explicitly select the menu item or from the context menu -- even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an application can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again, add the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently there is no possibility to restore entries, which were thrown into the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab key to enable the different workings (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) and the cursor buttons to meet a selection of top or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to postpone an entry into another rundown level, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired Runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a entry manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. use the tab button to accept the changes, or push mc to throw the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of loss loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. pre-settings are taken the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise they will be recovered by & ksysv; otherwise they will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts continually new. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard running level at a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services provided with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (LD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way, how system services can be launched in these distributions, but unfortunately, the configuration for the proprietary furnishings of these distributions, corresponds to no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use another distribution: please check if all configuration files are available (and, whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply end up without message, if their configuration files are not available or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the running level to allow this manual to be added."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to begin with & kuser; to begin, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you made changes, you need to save them. either use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the entry in the menu file."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window is a simple application. the main window consists of two carcards, the user and the user group list. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some postcards are only represented if you have enabled more advanced settings. only if you are creating space restrictions (Quota) for users will be created, on which you can make individual settings. further postcards appear, in case shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD Unixes are installed."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the ticket office appears, in case shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD Unixes are installed."</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this mapping card appears only, if for at least one-file filesystem (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here you can modify parameters for each user where the limited restrictions are available in KB:"</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the cardinal-card groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, you will find in the field Primacy group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by highlight them in the big box."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the dialog's dialog contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or group, select Add from the menu user or group or click on the appropriate add button of toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group works analogue."</seg>
