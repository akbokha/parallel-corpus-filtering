&quot; although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is extremely great .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American films , have danced with American music , American authors and operated his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a der@@ mati@@ cal effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; when 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ let letter , a fear@@ less author who was with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ ed the Supreme Court of Rich@@ tern who were inclined to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was trapped .
&quot; free after Meth@@ od Man , &quot; &quot; I was &quot; &quot; as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , had only ampli@@ fied my admir@@ ation for the USA . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very black@@ ish love letter on its size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the xen@@ ophobia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he goes with his min@@ de@@ dness .
he never thinks of his opinion behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American , and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in favor of him for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes that he won in the Republi@@ can Pr@@ ism , was the highest number , which was ever reached by the party nom@@ ination candidate . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person if I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t get Tr@@ ump and his voters to tune with people that I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journalist program , takes people from all over the world , a deep faithful man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; also with the en@@ m@@ umps of world@@ view not with the author of Peter Bh@@ atia , the present publisher of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours with it , the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game . &quot;
&quot; m@@ umps In@@ tolerant is also in contrast to the generosity that I experienced at Sandy B@@ ahr , who fights for life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; nor does she fit to the dedication of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped with a lot of patience and grace , and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were even Andrew Lec@@ tur@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise coun@@ sel helped me much with my career . &quot;
these people and those affected by them are deepening my love of America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump spent his way to nom@@ inee Republi@@ can Presidential candidates , they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the argument with the idea that people have voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were prepared to overlook these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to describe the tr@@ ump @-@ voters as a rac@@ ist .
&quot; to arrange people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is superficial and dis@@ respectful , and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of whom most know are , for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control of a country that she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that in this America they are still important ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ated the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( anal . WC . : as much as &quot; drawing of the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cs &quot; ; wording from white in anch@@ oring to the white and whi@@ plas@@ h , which means as much as Sch@@ and@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as eviden@@ ced by the great Van Jones , exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions people all over the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this land chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ ji , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the White America this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America for 9 / 11 the white man is again at the ruin , say they say . &quot;
&quot; for all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of election . &quot;
on a manifestation for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; the crowd answered with a sil@@ ently , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; brood the amount . &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! they called them , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would anyone , who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous &quot; NE@@ IN ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ umps , saying the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could no longer find a place in this new America . &quot;
and this breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music @-@ school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
&quot; that the music that is played at both places , not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for a few years now , the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) is now playing in the community : one out of children and adults @-@ existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which has found a way to overcome the poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and the Ban@@ den violence . &quot;
&quot; but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth therefore offered a rare hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band@@ members take their commitments towards the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to meet their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come on and play with gle@@ aming eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , pu@@ bo@@ e , flute , Bon@@ go , Bon@@ go and Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village which is practically located at the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are made of recur@@ rent waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ prepared instruments , made up of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where recycling is commenced by F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez in order to transform parts of the case into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate G@@ ot , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , double b@@ asses , guit@@ ars , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones and perc@@ ussion , which were produced all out of the garbage . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ish and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , from Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in Los Angeles Times remembers F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local econom@@ ist and musician teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , to the early days : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no space for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach in the same place where parents worked in the garbage . children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact their parents , because many of them do not live together with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : one out of waste made violin .
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from re@@ prepared material and called The recycled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) draws the musical power to :
the world is produced about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like men in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational spectacle from trash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis .
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights against wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practiced solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re@@ publication happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , then , it was known that this ship had already been operated in purple fishing waters before the other coast of Africa was looking for . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were over accordingly , and little inclined to welcome a legislative bre@@ cher of this kind at its coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they refused to give up one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing payments . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries , which you just refused , &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the Ken@@ yan Fish@@ eries Authority . it is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of pill@@ age of fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; at the heart of this initiative , the criminal practices crossed and resources protects , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 was established by the N@@ RO Stop illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries who had driven the prime minister out of their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equal and working together . they exchange information and stand up to each other where it &apos;s about illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable trusts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden , why is illegal fishing a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; by clear dis@@ cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm the body that have a delicate equilibrium . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the snow@@ fl@@ emp@@ o , the actions now happen in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists of existing licenses , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that one had noticed during a port inspection or experience . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , if they move on the open sea via satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to mark the authorities to mark ships that fish in bot@@ tled areas , such as suspi@@ cious passenger routes , such that a ship invites its fired fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fish @-@ license , where they were on the road and maybe even if they have a pen@@ ister . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , can deny the adoption of such ships in their ports , and that the ships could not sell their cargo to their cargo . and that they can even be forced to the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then a significant financial loss for the owner , meaning that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leader director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is an advisory firm dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the platform already mentioned was created to attract 20 million USD in lost sales , which under@@ score eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i each year due to illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade in East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish fishing , which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also other illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; for example , practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag , counterf@@ eit lic@@ ences , specification of fanta@@ sies , the fish protected species and fish in nature conservation areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they are specifically taking advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make up the weaknesses of a not incomplete control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past a ship was illegal and a country could then say &quot; You dar@@ ed not to walk my harbour . &quot;
but another country could say &quot; Come to me &quot; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
since its foundation F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspected ships .
&quot; it has revealed criminal networks , which had counterf@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that were used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has found volati@@ le ships and found it . &quot;
&quot; due to his collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for fighting crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations also lead us pretty much into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; it builds a system , the F@@ ISH @-@ i should help , susp@@ ects ships precise . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , also helps to record the illegal ships that are happy to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , boss at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at tracking , an NGO who also deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships also turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be saved by satellite . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland is therefore helping build a system which links various information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
one model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has launched a platform on Global F@@ ishing Watch with Google and the Maritime Organisation Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide with the position of each single per@@ trac@@ eable ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; join forces with neighbours to get a better picture of who doing what is doing - this is simply meaning , &quot; says he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable trusts has a similar project to run , in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only criminals , but also deter@@ red . &quot;
&quot; ships that were exploited in the past without a license , and hardly to reck@@ on with consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now acquired a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to record Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board locks , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries &quot; , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa annually , several hundred million dollars disappear through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , in 2015 , six countries have joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also , they are fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With certainty , the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions &quot; , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state of Somalia at the first big triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under wrong flag - and not only the ship was used without a license , and were used locks network , which are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penetr@@ ated in ver@@ bot@@ ed waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collaborative way for the protection of the oceans actually works in the entire world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles will appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela goes further to : demonstrations in several cities with the aim to conquer the country &quot;
the road movement in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum for the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the Government of Venezuela had rejected the motion of opposition to a referendum on the minister of ministers , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans moved in their eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country in which they were gathered together on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the resi@@ ding of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also managed in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , centrally located north @-@ north of the Bundestag Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation in the country deterior@@ ated continuously , which is reflected in the everyday life of the Vene@@ tians by a acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
many representatives of the opposition saw Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; but ultimately the dra@@ in@@ ation of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting near Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sums up the current article in the context of the government of government : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence is among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial transaction ) and in which a serious and far @-@ sufficient lack of food and medicine was to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new governance . &quot;
&quot; the constitu@@ encies of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Party ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups called together , called on 27 October of a mass rally to support the National Assembly , the Venezu@@ elan Government &apos;s residence , the Venezu@@ elan Government &apos;s residence , should continue to persist . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; it is far from Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday and civil civil strike and on 3 November all went to Miraflores palace after Car@@ acas . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the programme &quot; &quot; re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the images of the mar@@ ches which are published in real @-@ time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in many areas of the country , but also disputes with poli@@ c@@ emen as well as pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most common pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator , which calls through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot;
&quot; will you kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot; &quot; cry this Venezu@@ el@@ ans . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter there are pictures that tell about disputes , as well as reports of repression and distr@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; especially large waves , the news proposed about polished oppression in the central @-@ north city of Marac@@ ay . &quot;
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect itself according to their own statement in front of the police and armed advoc@@ acy of the government .
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters were trying to stop the police forces , including this woman in the state of T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a carry no tubes , because otherwise you could see something that many nation@@ alists do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic unit makes the round which forms the amount of oppression per day : &quot;
so the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minister of ministers - this was now shown in the eyes of many innumerable people on the streets .
My@@ te@@ ks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dad@@ o claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your minister of ministers !
on the road !
&quot; other values consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has taken a little against the devast@@ ated economic crisis and would prefer to deal with critical voices : &quot;
you have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some vene@@ ers reported the media , they are too hungry to take part in a strike , rather than working or go shopping . &quot;

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; now , as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now within the framework of the Great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera Process in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting at the BÃ¼r@@ de , the same name as his father carry up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he held the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that you are manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was genocide . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship of 1974 until 1983 , a period of stat@@ ute was his father from 1976 to 1978 The commander of the secret Department of 141 in prison La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who spoke before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power has a parent in his child and how this child chose a path of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . I was there with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
they all called it &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo , and asked me to identify my friend . &quot;
he said :

so he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; he said to me , I would be a secret . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had gotten myself .
on the military base I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ da dr@@ ush the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time he commanded me to rise up . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just all possible - stood . &quot;
everything from that was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small piece of wick@@ ets and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a great cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the stolen items were dropped and entertained me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I mo@@ wn in , and saw a couch that were tor@@ tured on men . &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached to the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was just there .
&quot; they often have a man with hand @-@ on to the bed , ski@@ pped him with water and compl@@ ained to him a load of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the st@@ ench in it was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately again and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me for the third time to work , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand @-@ sh@@ ud@@ der and bind them . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were captiv@@ ated with the face down - all were captiv@@ ated on hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people still sit down on mattresses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What do you see so , Ar@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I disp@@ ens@@ ed , Why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told me at home .
besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra were some rooms that were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero smote a man and killing a man .
&quot; ( according to the survivors of the civil law , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the memorial La Per@@ la performs , by the former tor@@ ter@@ chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way you came in here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apped came here . &quot;
&quot; looking at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement came from above that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the euph@@ em@@ ism - for the removal of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War Cri@@ mes &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things coming home .
&quot; at that time , at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war &quot; - as they did . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war prec@@ eded a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs which one fought a enemy that is fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one walks into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothing , paintings , money ... l@@ acked , then this is not a war@@ ring but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; I was Officer during the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house , and to ste@@ al everything in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a criminals , and I answered , and thou that thou shou@@ ld@@ est take cars on the road ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and express yourself stub@@ born . &quot;
we do not need any other !
that was my father .
I have no good memories of him .
&quot; when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of that time , on which I carried a jacket and a sco@@ op pul@@ lover of wool . both my father made of La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes at home . &quot;
&quot; then the defense accused me of being a pity of this crime . I was reluc@@ tant , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
anyway I was there to declare .
&quot; the bol@@ dness of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you have only children , one recognizes the value of one life . &quot;
it develops further and recognizes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you were ex@@ i@@ dered to people during the dictatorship . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children do waste ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with his house , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they simply could have put them into prison .
I guess it was simply chosen to kill these people . but what their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
had these people not even families whom they had been handed over to their mortal rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearing of the cor@@ pse is the final ab@@ omin@@ able act that you can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they took machines to eradic@@ ate the mortal rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were sm@@ iled and somewhere escap@@ ing - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
&quot; the thought , to indicate my father was born during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I made him accus@@ ations for all of the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience . &quot;
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have no killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt distr@@ acted and asked me why the whole plain patriot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended . &quot;
then I shou@@ ting :
how can you tell me what to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed horrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; he did not with@@ stand &quot; &quot; Well then I get myself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what I did .
in 2010 I had the first ad .
I had finally recognized that he was a criminal .
nobody can pre@@ tend to me that I have been taken . I finally got out against my own father .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; fear@@ able car enthusiasts &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error in a center in Kyoto , where you can extend its driving licence . &quot;
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which you can extend its driving licence , in the last month witnesses a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; a sign was translated as the Japanese word , both the &quot; &quot; old motor@@ ists &quot; , &quot; the &quot; older drivers &quot; means &quot; but maybe also with bows to thank &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was on electronic ads from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine has been shared in social media .
&quot; the error was reported to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the locality of local time . &quot;
the published daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could there be such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; titled &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the proper name &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture apologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , they explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from translators and that the translation has not been checked for correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows via the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincerely sorry that older people felt by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News set out a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fear@@ able &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an adequate description of older drivers . according to the police the percentage of older drivers who are involved in accidents , but quite an occasion to concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Pre@@ fecture of Kyoto , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 by a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 oun@@ ces of seniors . this represents a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ iors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , their share rose to 17,@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has dropped in total , the proportion of seniors caused by seniors in the same period . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Reporter was not mentioned in the article published on Yahoo announced version of article comments to the light that portra@@ ys the prejudices some Japanese seemingly against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo over the translation error was given , among other things , the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ist &quot; &quot; ) about the reality ? &quot;
&quot; how faul@@ ty is the translation actually not , or ? &quot;
&quot; I do not find that this is a real translation failure . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and across Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true finding for this bizarre error in English .
photo of Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to over@@ use , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and to actively transfer active language skills to get it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with mother@@ language . in general , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; thus , a French native speaker should translate from English to French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue , which could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for over , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers , to learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that even have no foreign employees , can make any translation work internally . then , the Japanese staff , whose English skills are considered to be the best , to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ alled and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases arise by mechanical translations , show that this technique can still not replace a human translator . this is particularly true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English formulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or acceptable or at least harmless . however , by major companies or government who have the resources to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
the city of Kyoto has hopefully made a serious source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ ored measures on the Internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal as &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , the Venezu@@ elan Internet users that they have no access to the online radio station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
later other users wrote that the internet cuts of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV could no longer be accessible .
other online broad@@ c@@ als presented recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas organized by op@@ position@@ ists who res@@ ign from the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court had dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive , and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is up , and recommended the u@@ sians , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : enabled your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an@@ ischer provider are once again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ers , especially in times of civil distur@@ ban@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hesit@@ ant since 2014 in the reporting of protests . at that time , the Commission for tele@@ comm@@ uting them with fin@@ es and closing arguments if they continue to report on demonstrations as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up on @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it &apos;s surprising that this is still cheaper than to buy two lit@@ re Lim@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ IT confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online stations . this also concerns the Website , at which the National Assembly over@@ takes its meetings . &quot;
&quot; previous research inquiries made by the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that local Internet providers sometimes benefit to DNS . this involves a technique , through which the DNS servers will respond to specific domains . &quot;
&quot; when a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds correctly or denied the request when calling on such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; with V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked canal , the transfer on Thursday , April 6 , set , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flor@@ es , who took live the protests in Car@@ acas . &quot;
Flor@@ es was be@@ aten while he was in custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to broadcast again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still available on YouTube , it was also reported that the government regulated the Internet connections : so the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ers access to multi @-@ media reporting on current events in the country is still further complicated . &quot;
in Paraguay many girls will be able to master a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testimony of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report of curator , published by Global Vo@@ ices , with the kind permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which she was not together with the family who lived there , eat . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned once again into the house , and heard how the owner of the house spoke full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; that , from which something has become , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money passes her inferi@@ or son or her inferi@@ or daughter to another , richer family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that children can afford to pay countless days of household work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that cannot be held within the framework of a contract you cannot raise . &quot;
&quot; this as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , in Paraguay , is widely used in Paraguay due to the involvement and acceptance of large parts of society and , despite numerous diseases of human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered witness , researched and denoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things on behalf of name , for the feeling of gratitude , that is vacc@@ inated by the Cri@@ adi@@ tas , guaranteed in general breastfeeding . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who put their daughter in the faith that they will complete their education , improve their position in society and make something out of it , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family that takes the girl with herself and justi@@ fies the exploitation with the faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise no education would get , and maybe even missed . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mis@@ led , his family will experience only many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 the so far unknown phenomenon , which takes place in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of fierce stro@@ kes . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Mil@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a be@@ amer with the inhabitants .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira struck by a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n until they suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported about the incident . &quot;
stres@@ sing that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made deeply rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ish society &apos;s practice of cri@@ m@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest in protest and demanded that there are &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay is more cows than children registered , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , there is much easier to hurt the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a growing investigation into the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who had her Cri@@ adi@@ ta to be sentenced to 30 years imprisonment .
&quot; if the case before judgment comes , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n was dec@@ ayed by the case for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case by Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to work all of them and began to sell can@@ dies on the road , or on the market sweets , to make money . &quot;
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta into the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in the house of her employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn .
she stood up at five o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
&quot; for example , clean@@ se the refrigerator , p@@ umping the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ crete the floor . &quot;
when the school was at the end she went home and had time to learn .
&quot; the more she finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she never had hungry , but got also not unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as eating out of the fridge , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ edi@@ ner who was in power from 1954 until 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings of the house@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , in addition to standing and editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to give a faith to the reports of the official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; he thought it was intelligent , but he did not stay with her . &quot; the house@@ holder had found someone who listened to , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would like to learn &quot; poor habit . &quot; in this way , they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ i , would speak at home again their mother tongue . &quot;
&quot; they feared that they had their education , which they had allowed to lose . &quot;
&quot; however , it was completely clear that they had paid for everything they had paid by them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in the school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken , are Mob@@ bing and the Shi@@ kan@@ en , which cri@@ adi@@ ta are exposed to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , at the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I was not part of any group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the Society approved the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman released the following text in a Facebook group where you can see advertisements for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administration of the group is PE@@ PA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town@@ ship in the district of As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter , who in the morning and in the afternoon with her playing . &quot;
to learn .
please guide you .
start from Monday if possible .
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ ke &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village of Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ dest girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; wrote her . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the inland that wants to work &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then the fibres in the display turned once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I look if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I am writing again if something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
&quot; pro@@ log on to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , Â¿ H@@ ast@@ a cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , as long as yet ? ) , a collection of testimonies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history we have managed to prevent systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , during which the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ors had to settle tribute , and the natives of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( in which the workers were treated as semi @-@ slaves ) , and the native population of the Guaran@@ i had to pay tribute to a system of slavery during which they are light victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
social inequality in Paraguay and that is to show power is the key to the understanding of the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
draft legislation writes Egyptian users social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; sixty Egyptian members recently agreed to a draft law to &quot; &quot; regulations concerning the use and usage of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , you must register to use social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up to provide citizens with a permit to give citizens a permit to social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , commercial users and users must register on the site of the site with their right names and personnel numbers , in order to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is failed to do so , that could bring a sentence of up to six months in prison or cash . &quot;
&quot; the bill &apos;s draft which consists of six Par@@ ag@@ ra@@ fen and cur@@ sed in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application , which is running through the internet and used to communicate with others by means of voice , video clips and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced , since the draft will be no indication of how Egyptian authorities are to be imposed on account of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to register with the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , parliamentary committees and promot@@ ers of the legislative board , told the Magazin Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and a password to get through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocked . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to establish a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of which , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
yet so far it is not known that such plans exist .
experts and experts on site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research @-@ related research &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , &quot; told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I have doubts about the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they can control the physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take it seriously , then it means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and to supply them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative and constitutional committees before it enters into the plenary session . &quot;
&quot; whether its adoption and enforcement will be successful or not , the design &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military monument in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and be assured that no devi@@ ous scars on the picture surface is &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Parliament President El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy struck a legislative situation against cy@@ ber crime , in which a li@@ felong sentence sentence for those who found guilty to threaten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest to protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; high up in the mountains of Kurdistan , in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal @-@ ai@@ ded H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq work to protect the gh@@ ost Persian leop@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards , which strikes through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this certain type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; how R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; is the Persian Leopard , the only remaining predat@@ ory animal in the Kurdish ecosystem , and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on that a large predat@@ ory animal is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard actually is small and goes against zero . when the team in the video is therefore determined that they have a recording of a big cat at the camera , R@@ aza breaks in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained Bi@@ olog@@ in , R@@ aza is passionate about another side of their country that consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;

&quot; in the beginning of March 2017 , the progress made for the northeast of Japan were achieved in the last six years to re@@ construct the life of those who were affected by the &quot; &quot; triple disaster &quot; &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and a nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in the fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of thousands from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighborhoods of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were obs@@ essive , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappear whole coastal cities from the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still experienced a nuclear accident alone , because of that , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows how progress has been reached for six years to rebuild the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the paper includes statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
&quot; housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of planned replacement houses ( on the ground , on the ground , bar@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) has been completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures was able to record Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima continues to form the closure against Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; however , one is still trying to res@@ ett@@ led six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated of homes and shel@@ ters ( on the ground , the same , cas@@ e@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) . &quot;
after the triple @-@ disaster nearly 80 000 people saw forced to live in homes .
&quot; in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such accommodation . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 per cent of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in emergency shel@@ ters . over 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated courses which are shel@@ ters after the disaster in homes . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent . &quot;
state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures .
&quot; like the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 have been affected by 1100 schools that were affected by un@@ happiness until December 2016 , which makes up almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures are much more difficult . &quot;
&quot; during nearly 100 percent of the fisheries in I@@ w@@ ads and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , only 30 percent of the fisheries have been re @-@ established in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , have drawn in collaboration in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear incident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima are located in the &quot; nuclear area . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism recovered again in detail , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima is far off . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again up to 90 percent on the same stand , as before the ill . Fu@@ kus@@ hima one can only have 75 percent here . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it is harder to feel their living . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; to determine an overall picture , the paper led numerous surveys among the native population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also how their sensation has changed to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in its introduction to the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to get more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population in experience .
&quot; the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in terms of disasters prevention . &quot;
how it is about those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ated the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture
in its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also has directed its attention to the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to experience not only the enormous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic accident , atomic un@@ question@@ ing which Japan had ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were moved in areas outside of the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , more than 23 000 people were converted back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their native pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated areas are most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , which still have to compete in the homes for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ads and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this involves construction projects , which are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo . &quot;
the World is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; if one encounters people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences appear to be bigger than the similarities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more links more than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices , expand our prospects and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we deal with issues that often gain less attention than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices Members that remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ tt@@ man recalls that the love of music has consolidated the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time where she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit : last Friday he had taken him a police officers during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide took millions of demonstr@@ ators on a protest against savings .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma and several questionn@@ aires . &quot;
doctors run it on this Saturday and now have it in an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local picture of Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which quickly spread within Brazil within a few days .
&quot; on the pictures also the face of the police officers , which is also identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the completion of the investigation of the incident of the active ministry . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he strikes at Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his head@@ stock on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; if a police officers would cease on a prot@@ esters and end up on the Inten@@ sive station , his face would be six months on television and the entire oppression would thus be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Luz recorded video on the net in which one sees , as Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several param@@ edic shortly thereafter . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also folded into social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2.@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while being in hospital . &quot;

police attacks
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil where it was last Friday to brutal police forces against prot@@ esters .
&quot; poli@@ c@@ emen were set at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber stories and tr@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; the MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via loud@@ speaker on violence against prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media street prot@@ ested by continuing the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window wheel . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported a sli@@ pping glass window to make a photo out of their title pages illustr@@ ative .
&quot; against this , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a brand set by fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window wheel than about the protests of thousands , which serve to defend the defense of a special matter . &quot;
this must also recognise if you are strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; also here the term &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an absurd , dis@@ proportionate importance , and the typical violence of the military police are dec@@ eived by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confron@@ tations with the police . &quot; &quot;
the forgotten villages forgotten by the un@@ induc@@ ed villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar factories throughout Cuba ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the People &apos;s municipality Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an Province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of which there is no substantial sugar harvesting on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were placed in the sugar @-@ fabri@@ cated factories .
&quot; after the Er@@ lie , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost gradually and after its plants , until only the rum@@ ours of steel and concrete remained intact . &quot;
about 2@@ 72 workers had to be re @-@ inv@@ ent .
some are rarely the work .
&quot; other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied and com@@ mu@@ te daily to the factories , which are ex@@ hor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veteran , who is open every day at 4 : 00 , the crisis in the sugar cane industry did not smoke its sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region of sugar factories , he returned into operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were received . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene recalls that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane factory but the promise has not been kept .
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decision and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amoun@@ ted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; a few decades ago , the message would have been a motive for alarm for the country , but the bad harvest is no more news . &quot;
why has the Cub@@ an sugar cane sugar turned off ?
the old train station of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar mills were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to focus on production on the most efficient factories that amoun@@ ted to 4 million tons .
they only left the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the small productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar @-@ price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 until 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; &quot; Agricultural Policy &quot; &quot; of the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; when the current production of 2001 would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the Roh@@ on@@ cker export would manage around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the day &apos;s day will come into history with certainty , which were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
since then the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
&quot; in the following years , the lac@@ tation of 98 sugar farms , more than 65 million people got their full salary for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar factory Greg@@ orio Arl@@ berg Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier is known about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be tac@@ kled .
&quot; as a result , the place is maintained , they formed a full time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially summ@@ ed by officially recorded documents that would be removed only in terms of parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ m Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could give any acceptance . &quot;
the responsibility passed on from there and the letters were always more frequent .
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for two years for the tac@@ kled factory , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will in the breastfeeding of the factory , where construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with each part he left , he dis@@ missed one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace has been eliminated .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for working sites and services that generated the plants in the communities in which they were . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech held on 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present persons , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer running , everything would run well . &quot;

&quot; after two years , the People &apos;s municipality Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; as the sugar factory finished , or rather said than they began to kill them , they also listened to , the road to asp@@ hal@@ ting , this is also disadvantaged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories had to look for . &quot;
they were sent to spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new system are still imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working . &quot;
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty harv@@ ests bring the old soldiers an pensions of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to reti@@ re the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a thoughtful person , yet he gives the lies who told him . &quot;
you tor@@ ment him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes back to R@@ ent for 65 years , not because it is lacking in force , but because it is bitter . &quot;

&quot; the workshop is increasing that the young participants in talks subjects such as &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self acceptance or whatever of them comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; on which almost two dozen young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
&quot; the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of globalization . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people are not always able to master the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ istr@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation is recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop group , who gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ site of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the St@@ rop@@ he is available in conversion , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if none were interested in me
but I try to go on earth for my days
this is the day when you will take our cry
because we have lost our way to life in our youth
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
this is how they can grow and also move forward to our youth
&quot; thus , they can do that , why they chose the creator . &quot;
&quot; in the commentary part , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ ary ( which is published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan you can see almost any restaurant plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are displayed near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ towards san@@ pur@@ u ( , on the ground , &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic models of the dishes &quot; ) , served at this restaurant . &quot;
&quot; customers can look at these plastic meals , and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on . &quot;
there is a whole industry dedicated to making these plastic meals .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small businesses that produce that plastic film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ner in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic meals are so usually that they don &apos;t even consider them more to all . however , a new trend is transforming it today into show@@ y cell phones and other gadgets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ omas published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ towards san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now on sale : new with plastic installed decor@@ ates mobile phone bands , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been turned to kit@@ sch@@ ed collection @-@ objects , as in this case , cooling cabinet magnets : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ cks and a cooling unit for a new exhibition in Tokyo station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences becomes increasingly costly .
&quot; in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a cell @-@ handed . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a mobile phone a good use .
we have also made this part of the exhibition in Tokyo .
here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to see like an apple , with a candle for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and this is just the beginning of an increasing strain .
&quot; some mobile phone rings and phone designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case i@@ cur@@ a or salmon @-@ resistant is used , a popular picnic table , which is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can forgive my mobile with salmon @-@ related g@@ ents ? &quot;
I believe I will probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic labels can also take a less appe@@ tising form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest cell phone handed has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ tapes made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; further sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic meals can be viewed below : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter using the h@@ ash@@ tag # , if , on the same , &quot;
&quot; if you would like to find out more about the origin of these trends , then this video gives you insight into the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , who is dedicated to the Bel@@ ie@@ ce of the Restaurant industry . as for example , with the sho@@ ku@@ dos P@@ pur@@ u . &quot;

a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against the drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; struggle against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; in Mexico only dive in statistics . however , these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy which this struggle takes . &quot;
&quot; reporting about drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict fully in the background . &quot;
&quot; the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the bere@@ av@@ ed or to the con@@ gregations that have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; standing behind every body , behind each bone re@@ funds in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of loose parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds might never cure . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ isi@@ a Vi@@ vir El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with the drug store &quot; ) , which aims to give this sacrifice a voice and stories about people who in the struggle between enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime cannot be afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug retailers and all con@@ gregations do not have to drive many kilometres to buy something such as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changed &quot; ) tells about these stories .
&quot; one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is seeking secret graves after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , which lost only one day to her father , her four sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have asked ourselves to go , and to graves , according to the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
&quot; he was 28 , when he disappeared . &quot;
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are at the insurance of my Father , but it does not pay off them , because they demand a mort@@ als . &quot;
where should we get ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ dly con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who face fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a les@@ bian from Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with disease and sensation journ@@ alism for some years now .
&quot; I am passing every day of newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the title pages with pictures , which actually can only come from a textbook for criminals or experts from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I cannot be equal to or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old C@@ ousin thinks that he is Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will be when he is great . and it &apos;s also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; &quot; of punishment if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , that is , as if they are sc@@ aling that have lost someone and those who have fear that something happened to them too . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories to blo@@ gged numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; in@@ som@@ nia of human beings is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students were justified in a neighboring village that they were &quot; &quot; an@@ aesthe@@ tist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to speak of such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ red and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; four months of black@@ mail in the main city district : as a family po@@ ached with threats , it describes how armed criminal month was redeemed from their business until they end up not only the business but also ow@@ es her family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of it never passes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed ; phone numbers also .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are from each other , the better . &quot;
it included its report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , as you don &apos;t know when they will run or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , if crying would dissolve my deep feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to crying . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of violence referred to . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a father@@ less and he tells that he had to teach yourself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; &quot; for the babies which are with him . this is his name for preparing the vial of water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - Un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he said that his mother was gone . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood had been past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody bodies of his father saw , who was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organized crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mor@@ als for public security and government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the average of 8,@@ 5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just some hundreds of hundreds of thousands who have organised crime against Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
only few stories live on the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we must not forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ er@@ a Vi@@ vir El Nar@@ co &quot; , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico 2015 has launched the Dat@@ co@@ data project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ tured the country over the last four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this contribution and the pages to which he links , contain images , on which violence is shown . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to lift up a rum@@ or or fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the years after something the first time has appeared ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to persist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it was mis@@ leading to use trage@@ dies , which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false p@@ airing between image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - denied not the fact that there are plenty of me@@ tic@@ ulous reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; however , it raises questions about our desire for images to messages . &quot;
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a petrol station crossed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ cked around and explo@@ ded . in fact , 230 people came to live . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war Africa was the second largest land for years been neglected and destroyed . the streets in the region had become dangerous paths , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
tragic fell to the victim of the petrol station to the victim .
&quot; official Represent@@ atives described a fire@@ ball , the d@@ utz@@ ing houses envel@@ oping including a movie theaters , which was full of people who views the soccer world championship . &quot;
houses tra@@ ded and glu@@ ed cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to the disorder .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 2015 Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; it shows rows of stolen bodies , which are clo@@ aked in the ground while people are looking at them . &quot;
but the story does not find its end here .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been imposed several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , and they mistak@@ enly believe in relation to the trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities in front of which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ pse was in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed , but nobody stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said a citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
many have been crus@@ hed to be shot or burned .
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the subsequent time could be shown bil@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army @-@ based point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military and the attempt at B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo to be mis@@ understood as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this predic@@ tive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ concep@@ tions ; Africa Check has been documented in order to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all of these cases the picture was presented as proof for mass@@ aging .
yet another step further bring personal comments like this example the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to supply arguments .
the picture of San@@ ge joined in Myanmar with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash , published by the United Nations those who could escape blows , rape and a number of dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported on violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , po@@ sts like the following to bring these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an acid @-@ Arab message , which was mistaken , the President of the mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein and had been involved in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to provide this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , the AF@@ P as their source , did likewise mistak@@ enly declare this statement , but did not agree to the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false boxes extend up to the years 2011 and 2012 and come back from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture @-@ search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 images under 18 May 2017 ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images found the said picture from the DR Congo very similar .
&quot; they come from a mixed mas@@ king of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have passed false reports and have tried other attempts to un@@ cover counterf@@ eit@@ ing .
&quot; we have limited examples for the mis@@ used use and associated with the respective countries , based on which page they were published , thereby , we want to be more clear than the language alone . &quot;
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also associated with each other ) several examples of mis@@ used use .
here are a few cases that can now be completely pointed out ( on the map in orange ) :

&quot; the orange @-@ sided countries point to pages or server , over the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ se@@ ams are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in grey are examples that are available according to met@@ adata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also for@@ warding . &quot;
&quot; reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed at Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; War of Buddh@@ ists against Muslims . &quot;

&quot; in this post a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City is not just the wrong message , but also discussed the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as continuing trage@@ dies ( in DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;

&quot; La Rep@@ Ãº@@ blica cited as his source the Spanish news agency E@@ fe ( although not known , whether the original report included the picture ) . &quot;
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; after the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one , who used the picture from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; clearly , have clearly seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster . &quot;

a Association of The@@ ology of The@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Muslim countries published an open letter to the support of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and for the depic@@ tion the picture of the DR Congo .

&quot; Nigeria , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo was divided from the DR Congo as a proof for the bombing of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion . &quot;
Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of a mis@@ sive use of the picture from the DR Congo , with a t@@ we@@ et , sympathy from the Nig@@ erian Mass@@ akers , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are per@@ secuted , since the photos of them were ab@@ used . &quot;
Myanmar .
&quot; the Myanmar government published a selection of references to what they came as &quot; inten@@ tionally fin@@ ite messages and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions about Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; these pro@@ vision@@ ing , which appeared exclusively in English , also includes references to counterf@@ eit pictures of smells that operate H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to present that Muslims kill Buddh@@ ists and to the other ( which is often distributed by Bur@@ m@@ ical nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , which directed itself to the members of the Russian @-@ Orthodox Church , is clear that the picture of the DR Congo is NOT to kill Muslims . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar took part in 1994 , that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story with the image from San@@ ge . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image continues to be included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article of 2014 about students , published by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now redeemed news page An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly stated that the image is not from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it &apos;s a &quot; similar d@@ utch attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was later in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist that there would be connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ da@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burning to the world ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo emerged , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and redeemed a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities found these events , the mut@@ in@@ compar@@ ably in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; USA , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as proof of the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with it , were attacked in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to focus attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media reporting compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) .
&quot; after a message which allegedly was written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacre , translated it on the Vietnamese , and explained it to the Vietnamese , and explained it to the registration . &quot;
&quot; from the message , in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and united with image dat@@ ac@@ amas in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all of these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original release of 2010 , the image is ultimately perhaps a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong topics or frames ( fr@@ aming ) , which will draw these po@@ sts . the first frame focused on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in terms of greater discussions about the silence in the context of Christians through Muslims and - to defend the Muslims - the proceeds of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddh@@ ists .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how a African life is evaluated in comparison to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worthwhile to examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when reading these pictures can no longer be able to give faith . &quot;
&quot; with social media there are tens of people who have un@@ intended , the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggest that mood of inf@@ alli@@ bility and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and narro@@ wed it to the real Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of rap@@ tured images was already deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the re@@ taining of images of a ref@@ usal is equal to acknowledge the tragedy . at times these pictures even require from the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images and audience des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , the studied , such as violent media to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there are a lot of positive representations in the news media , fact , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the struggle against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . they will thoroughly think about the situation in which a picture is something suggested that , however , can also be solved by the context or on completely mis@@ sive nature . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of fal@@ ters should also take into account as internationally as they can . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ brid@@ geable ) makes every effort to offer language exc@@ ites a selection of words from around the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these uns@@ ur@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sour ) and others that are rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not sufficient , which is why a full explanation and sometimes something is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist decided by &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird , to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the mut@@ u@@ at@@ u language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Do you care for your parents in recognition of how to try you in your recent years .
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ ky language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or sl@@ oth , which you feel after having been dar@@ ed on cold days in the sun . &quot;
in Burma &apos;s own words about his blog About :
&quot; they def@@ enses other cultures , revealing other thought of thought and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you affect how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , want to publish more of these &quot; uns@@ us@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; , &quot; which are highly appreciated by in@@ tran@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite places here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is converted with the worst fl@@ ut@@ ary disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst high water and aqu@@ atic disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a , and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped into 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to an opinion of the disaster of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of hundred people are missing because of the floods and slots . &quot;
over 400 000 people have been affected by the last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe places .
&quot; the rainf@@ alls were left on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the waterfalls in some areas were slowly coming back . &quot;
health and hygiene events constitute a massive challenge in the affected areas affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the Fl@@ ut@@ ary disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water @-@ states of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lan@@ kas are fatal floods the den@@ sing crisis , warning the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was standing in the floo@@ ding water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da with G@@ alle flooded with G@@ alle as well because of the yesterday , the water@@ front of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force has five planes made available for b@@ ail@@ out actions , and another five are made for transportation of supplies for the residents made in their flooded villages . &quot;
also various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have prepared to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ ings in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue ships will need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to dry the dry food and life @-@ necessary goods for high water @-@ offerings -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the cat@@ astro@@ phy will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tro@@ ma@@ sturb@@ ating Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button , which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then forwarded free to the s@@ lan@@ c Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; as well , they led a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which had more than thousands of requests and 150 successful boat actions for floo@@ ding , and vom@@ iting people . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , they bring people in need for security and make help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kas are now im@@ min@@ ent to the restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot;
Muslims who cannot see

photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
using j@@ ig@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend .
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she trusted her children , she is my rock in the br@@ anding . &quot;
in the one minute we call a slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ ating we aim to protect the rights for Trans@@ actions .
&quot; we are in a sea of Um@@ br@@ ellas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ to@@ wel high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ ating slo@@ gans against Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; these things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; , &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people who work with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built themselves in their conception . &quot;
you em@@ ulate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify with it to be Muslim , to different kind . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim dra@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; this dra@@ wer is so well designed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , the way I do not match there . &quot;
de@@ priv@@ ation are being colon@@ ized
I am not alone .
this even has happened to the poet whose poetry in America is not sold : Rum@@ i .
which images come in a sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am now he was a Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
&quot; Islam , the Koran , and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western idea , the religion of Rum@@ is was removed , as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduction of Moslems from Muslims and Western books have been colon@@ ized for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the groundbreaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid cr@@ ush history behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these images are also prot@@ ested today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry , and Hollywood explo@@ ded them continues . &quot;
&quot; I worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our News@@ fe@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this fo@@ rati@@ os over@@ shadows the reality that has resulted in nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US did not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this fo@@ rati@@ y fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are going to bear in mind their head@@ ro@@ ud in public buildings and to cover Saudi Arabia by their government to cover the entire body that these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong fo@@ rati@@ y weak@@ ened , Muslim women , movements for change . &quot;
it looks that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American ground by Afri@@ cans who were hi@@ ma@@ yed here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this fo@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination , so low and faul@@ ty , that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children are becoming the goal of tim@@ us@@ li@@ ous attacks and ra@@ ils . &quot;
&quot; on account of these stories , which we tell and , due to the way we tell them , Islam@@ ophobia is today not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
the 1,7 billion belong
&quot; in the news industry , we are doing more than just stories to tell which are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
&quot; we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative , who can help us understand the world . &quot;
and my industry fails to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion .
and we have failed to make an account of seven million Muslims in the highest degree of &quot; various &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the entire Muslim people are afri@@ can Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation coming from 77 countries .
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother made her first jewelry design at 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York . skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ cian from Bangladesh , with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan thought out the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were irreversible Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I not f@@ aded Mus@@ lim@@ a and Americ@@ an@@ erin ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask why I do not ask a por@@ k , I say - instead of taking my Muslim recipes or to carry my hand@@ some pocket records , all Muslims - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I joke , we do not wear all the flas@@ ks with us . &quot;
we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ar , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight widespread lies on Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the running band of a well @-@ balanced Islam@@ ists , Thin@@ k tanks and experts for false information , which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; due to the stories we tell and , due to the kind in which we tell them , Islam@@ ophobia is more than just a stranger who is a woman sh@@ ro@@ ud . &quot;
&quot; or as the start@@ ling card of attacks on mos@@ ques , see below . &quot;
scre@@ enshot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ ophobia is in its ugly forms our affili@@ ation attacks .
&quot; it acc@@ esses our identity that is so far , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer . &quot;

I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a Muslim was born then into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of an Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social @-@ religious lives describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my neighbor in the Brand@@ ing , see that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a , when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; it would see the omni@@ present ritual with my daughter , when I sit down in my arms and her the Arab verses to protect the Qur &apos;an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one you can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my muscle belief is not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; belonging to my grandmother &apos;s mother is the image of my grandmother &apos;s mother on the part of her sisters , as she also gained a competition in the art of flo@@ wering in Kar@@ achi . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of it that I &apos;ll see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by its ful@@ ler and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ Hei@@ liger ; and one Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters that can be almost agile . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a means to speak the prayers they had told me , when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; to be Mus@@ lim@@ a in it , as she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people , that - over centuries - was established by a &quot; Empire , &quot; which has established a company with the name of honour British Ost@@ ination company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my zu@@ ander@@ ter grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the middle , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of Kas@@ h@@ mir@@ s , crying N@@ ana J@@ aan ruled over his family in India ruled by me , family , which he could not close in his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , like with my grandfather , have been torn apart from coloni@@ alists , who have shared the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;
&quot; to be Mus@@ lim@@ a means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans all have been de@@ ported up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected in a century above a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian sub@@ tan of the British empire , was described by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were air@@ planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to belong to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family rooms ; our un@@ plug@@ ged history .
&quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops being distributed over every continent apart from the Antar@@ c@@ tica , distributed in Iraq , to em@@ chase weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of war .
one American mus@@ li@@ a means to know that the su@@ icide under the veteran since 2001 has risen more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy bears the U.S. and carries the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the history of four times more reported than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four @-@ hundred years of the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , called by a liber@@ ated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this country . &quot;
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I sen@@ sed as people over@@ crowded airports in order to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
&quot; it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams , and when we say black lives . &quot;
&quot; a Americ@@ an@@ erin , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a nut@@ me@@ i , a Muslim feder@@ acy of our with multiple @-@ fold identi@@ ties , but to fail to communicate it to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cub@@ es , but is represented in the cul@@ arity &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care about my child and build all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people are erect on this branch of structural Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ ophobia consists in the Muslim registr@@ ars , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in @-@ end @-@ to @-@ end monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists in the immigration officer , which takes five years old child into hand . &quot;
&quot; it consists in a country that exclu@@ des its borders with people from just the countries , which are bombar@@ ded . &quot;
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ Fly @-@ list that is largely Arabs and Muslims in sight .
these are the wars that we lead and the bombs which we have on Muslim countries .
&quot; due to the stories we tell and , due to those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University participants showed a scientific and real image and b@@ ate them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the con@@ gregations we have to lead
&quot; we are too deep to dis@@ miss the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous im@@ prints that we are engaged in our news transactions . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which is trying to grasp our many often @-@ looking identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast Lake something , S@@ ay says of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the vir@@ ale video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ lier , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global period in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1,7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason for the conspir@@ ators , which existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ entially because they have made Muslim to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ entially , as it has created the &quot; Other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for a few years previously , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate great areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history which I wasn &apos;t aware of it when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but which today made me a unavoidable Mus@@ lim@@ a . &quot;
things that I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ ctions that make up our humanity like a story , where someone is made to another &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations are held at the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ ophobia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academics speak about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

&quot; we need to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and consciously to for@@ tify the &quot; others &quot; because the employment that we have had a new future in which we have no president who has already capit@@ alized countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people bombar@@ ded , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for Nar@@ c@@ art wants to protect urban diversity
&quot; tell @-@ about , from Flickr users Daniele Rossi , using the license B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to connect to someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the count of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it . &quot;
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird to the Un@@ translated blog .
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of major cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS already has conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages do not be passed on to those born children . &quot;
for the creators of the project apply :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we establish cities to take the diversity - safe spaces , where residents do not have to forget who they are to be . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; often listen to it is often connected , &quot; &quot; for these events instead &quot; &quot; listening to the list@@ ener to appreciate , to feel , align . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers will first present their story in their own language , or tell them in English . &quot;
&quot; if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , so lead their devotion and representation to it that the list@@ eners can be moved to it . &quot;
they give laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this lap , the stor@@ yt@@ ellers R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou are also the opportunity to explain the stor@@ ks of narr@@ atives for their country . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ uss of H@@ asen and the Pavi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona of Zimbabwe :
&quot; having explained the meaning of his f@@ ath@@ om , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in , he shares his feelings of inclu@@ siveness : &quot;
you have listened to !
you were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling in three cities took place and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico demands from the United States of re@@ establishment of the sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a new examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place on 72 million US dollars , participating in 72 million US dollars , participating in the pu@@ b@@ arian Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran up to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the Old City of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
it was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil Front for the neur@@ examination of the debt ) and the Ã@@ kom@@ en@@ ian church meeting in Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the spokes@@ man of the re@@ setting of debts also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos asks , that politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies , who are responsible for debts for their corrupt . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial assessment and a leadership committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions and remun@@ eration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will pres@@ se@@ pressed and sup@@ pressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not take up with declining retirement deposits .
we demand immediate measures .
&quot; the island - not into the state of state , integrated territory of the USA - suffers from a severe financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New economics , &quot; is proposing a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization with no focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state power . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; from the outside , measures imposed by the people will be liable without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developers Bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is already missed over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue to campaign for his freedom and remind the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s re @-@ public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which is aimed at the annual conference in Berlin , dedicated to the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a researcher in Germany based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , Head of Book in Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher who produced by so @-@ called &quot; Book Spr@@ ints &quot; finished books within three to five days , las@@ en excerpts from the book cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ des ( The costs of Freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and license is freely available here , contains a number of approaches that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are structured , and what the real costs are , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers , researchers , researchers and authors who are involved in the moti@@ ons for free knowledge have been side by side to view over the fog that surrounds our News@@ fe@@ eds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , beloved and celebrated internet volunteers , who has been incar@@ cer@@ ated in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was painted from the A@@ dra @-@ prison directory in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
we have no information about his current state or place of residence .
&quot; the introductory part of his book with the title of collective remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bas@@ sel pays for a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us have started to think about their own f@@ ates , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we today here ?
why did we decide ?
what did we give up in this process of timely convic@@ tions ?
the web developers for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the detention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra @-@ prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and Ombud@@ sper@@ son N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military poli@@ c@@ ei Bas@@ sel reported on the basis of a &quot; &quot; secret &quot; &quot; command of the Military Court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi said , she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who presented himself as an in@@ sider of the Assad government and took note of a alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , his place of residence and condition remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and to the general public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ sels cultural prototypes are more favourable than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
Pal@@ my@@ ra is one of the most important archaeological sites in the world was the cross @-@ crossing of numerous civilizations and here merge gre@@ ek @-@ Roman architecture types with hi@@ es@@ ful traditions and per@@ si@@ can influences .
&quot; at that time Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put all this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strike in the digital arche@@ ology and conservation has created a time of time , which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; in case , Bas@@ sel has not yet completed this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my whole life with it , of freedom to dream and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English even when he was in custody .
I learned to write and speak English well .
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with every person who asked us . he has taught others to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bas@@ sel opened my door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet at .
&quot; he also taught other detention , how to use computers , at least theoretically , without causing them in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of orph@@ an ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ vocation , which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 her husband , when he was in custody . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together in the book for a year .
they used the texts to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabian language .
the book is Lic@@ ensing @-@ free .
cover from Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens during every visit ;
that I miss in the world of your charming eyes
&quot; that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;
that any dangers not matter to me
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and watch@@ men &quot;
I forget the memory of the prison
&quot; and I pray in every detail of your voice , and words &quot;
I carry my passion with my passion
if your eyes must be happy
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
to withdraw all the moments
and through your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I over@@ witness myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the detention of Bas@@ sel , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote : &quot;
&quot; one year goes , my soul &quot;
during and while
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ sels &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime Bashar al @-@ Assad , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for human rights ) have disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
those who were arrested or imprisoned by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Sy@@ rer in custody . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel for 2012 .
we continue to repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption condemned the director to the release from release to the post office
&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ ans reacted with wrath on a corrupt fall , when a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , which the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose Council is Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance , and immediately requested his re @-@ setting into the company , which took place on 19 April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General Public Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office of the Republic , which agreed to the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to get back to his old post , since the company has no discipl@@ in@@ arity after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many citizens do not need the promotion well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Integr@@ ated de P@@ Ãº@@ blica , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned into an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to put the director again : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and it is even a back@@ stage with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note of it is that the firm would also have to lead a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ procedure against the reluc@@ tance .
&quot; however , the company apparently fails and prompted no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ que social media , does not reject this behavior and considers the case being &quot; conflic@@ ting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would have advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and sent half of it . &quot;
&quot; he could keep paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could give advice and image pol@@ ishes . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped to cause damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly pay for its silence . &quot;
contradic@@ tory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ an and student of political science in Brazil says , the Director had no moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state , because it insul@@ ts him , I cannot believe that one is rewarded with someone in such a way that the state has already massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing the mor@@ als and serve the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it only served itself by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as hand@@ ele it has become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired , re@@ charged and finally condemned to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I do not know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ ines , to remind you that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; Die@@ be belong to the prison quarters of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , not only to be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , tr@@ acked and - incidentally , prophes@@ ied - prophe@@ tic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was , when he affir@@ med that &quot; a ambitious human being capable of all , even the father@@ land for his ambitions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambitions . &quot;
&quot; an ambitious person is de@@ crimin@@ ally , at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were likewise declined :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment ; he sat for 10 years and came free .
&quot; and today it sets up the company in which he denied funds , once again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ f. &quot; &quot; ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017 &quot;

Facebook is blocking the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users .
the Bur@@ m@@ ical word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means Ki@@ cher@@ ish or Sp@@ y@@ b@@ se .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar the well @-@ known social network took their po@@ sts out of the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
&quot; although about the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people ost@@ indi@@ an origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or both of the same ( in Bur@@ m@@ ical Scripture ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
&quot; in recent years , the rise of a radical nationalist movements in the word has given the word an extremely ab@@ sten@@ ance con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
Kal@@ ar &apos;s may usually be associated with racism but the word itself does not automatically emerge hate speech .
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people also reported that Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts for its use being expressed . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several bur@@ ial words with fundamental different meanings , which have the same letter like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ically also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( bell ) or &apos;@@ kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ use A@@ ung Ka@@ at explained the different meanings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends on a rich way whether they knew how he could rel@@ ieve his back pain , having a word of word . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the questionnaire - resembles the racial expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech radic@@ alists of radical nation@@ alists , however , that Facebook must be analytical , before it all po@@ sts , which were in suspi@@ cion to spread racism . &quot;
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
&quot; automati@@ sm is not understood , what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook . &quot;
&quot; what it should do instead , the post is carefully to analyse and control it by checking the next words . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists spread the hate speech , got a pretty good lesson . &quot;
&quot; now , it is time to proc@@ ure their nationalism . &quot;
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone to spread the hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often become a K@@ atz@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the cens@@ ored words to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author of A@@ ung Ka@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his po@@ sts , when he wanted to inform his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to accept the light , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; Facebook Community standards did not ent@@ ail &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech more radical nation@@ alists .
&quot; Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post office , the author distributed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ical Internet community to ask for advice : &quot;
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to decrease racism in Burma through their platform but it does not work .
such words will be cens@@ ored even more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started without local context or technical support and so words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; inheritance curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they would have large sales , this would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Po@@ sts , which contained no hate speech but nevertheless removed : &quot;
with permission is used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ical text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and look at an Indian movie .
&quot; just to try out if Facebook contains the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
scre@@ enshot with permission .
&quot; the post is &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot;
scre@@ enshot with permission .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have increased social networks to increase their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should also connect the violence in Burma in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ ov@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure , the ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ical pages under control . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better been viewed in context as on code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is an end with the marriage

the Children &apos;s ehe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament adopted unanimously a law which is supposed to ban this practice , so that the aged age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this amendment of the marriage law , some members killed Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ th@@ ad Mahar@@ aj said that the state did not interfere with the representatives of the various religious groups of the country , that the state does not interfere with the maturity of the country , since that , age do not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; what happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is an contractual partner of the UN &apos;s rights Convention , the minority of children under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics from the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were already married with 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2,@@ 8 percent , and with 18 were 8,@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Reserve of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements asp@@ iring to set laws to children &apos;s toe , followed at the foot and pleasing to great support . undoubtedly hal@@ ves them to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du guide , Z. B. had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should be dam@@ n for their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition cat@@ ered for tensions in this actually in@@ complicated thing , and at some point they had doubts as to whether the opposition would approve the draft law . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft law against the children was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , who enth@@ used to be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would do him to the law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must agree with the law .
&quot; one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a status update , which re@@ posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill &apos;s draft against children before was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for them and no one on the other .
&quot; after having decided in the Senate , the design can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media @-@ media was enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws of child@@ birth have finally been changed .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who cloth@@ ed an Minister for Education Ministry , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary talk needed , that the core of the thing is conce@@ aled , but do you know what ? the Children &apos;s ehe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson of the opinion was , it was definitely long enough to put the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ e @-@ Thomas survived that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Excellent News ! &quot;
the marriage law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , who openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the mar@@ ry age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religion of religion 18 years .
&quot; the draft of the amendment of the marriage law was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 dep@@ u@@ ties and of which 35 were present at the vote . &quot;
&quot; all Members , who were against , have voted for the law . &quot;
the Children &apos;s ehe is legally permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # Cl@@ ass@@ age@@ is@@ tion .
many thanks to all activists who have raised him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dharma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the best known Hin@@ du @-@ organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced its intention to take judicial steps , the law should be adopted and he seems to em@@ ulate his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the general pro@@ secutor of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a suppor@@ ter of the law , meant it is entirely legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wants to go against the law , the most social media users , you would like to tackle the debate differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
&quot; dear Sat , when we , instead of keeping the discussion so generally speaking , in a way that we , the state would be able to speak out of the problem that they may , our daughters against it , that it may be ab@@ used to them , then be mis@@ used , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm , although there are laws they say . &quot;

&quot; at 11.@@ 15 , the message was removed from the side - in the interim memory , however , it remained intact . &quot;
it is # sc@@ van@@ ished
&quot; on Sunday early , the office of the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s office shared the local news service Yar@@ news that they were h@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; by mir@@ rors of websites , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia @-@ page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contradic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally dark . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month Turkey has now been the popular and the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based En@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
&quot; day by day becomes clearer , how important is the platform for users to find helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV @-@ series are fighting against the block .
&quot; although many techn@@ ologically advanced Internet users are used to use envel@@ oping tools for blocking websites ( a current article from the New York Times reports on that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been published articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in an published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been taking place since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 5@@ 6@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be locked , there are now several Mir@@ r@@ or@@ pages ( sites that mirror the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ network ( i.e. machine @-@ computer compounds ) which is not based on the system of domain names and thus a complete cens@@ orship is difficult . &quot;
the content is accessible in spite of legal prohibition .
in a blo@@ gger IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( about the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) , we put everything on it , sn@@ apshots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alised and distributed . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to at least to look at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ os@@ a.@@ org itself . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was performed independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no Live@@ - or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to avoid blocking . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy reached an open source page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar Mir@@ r@@ or@@ Pages in the respective country in Wikipedia . &quot;

&quot; it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror . &quot;
&quot; you can access a different URL , which is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially , the server direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia @-@ page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself then if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;

&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poorly positioned motives and washed colors . &quot;
the motivated him to carry on himself a camera and try to understand the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar endeav@@ ours to bring to the international stage in Sag@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; and its home town right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which direct the attention to Nep@@ as wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook as he was able to help him first @-@ class location at his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate game photographer ! ! &quot;
&quot; I rested just at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) had called me . he had a call from my father , that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a leop@@ ard would be a leop@@ ard . &quot;
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
&quot; my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side , where the leop@@ ard was found and I immediately began to kne@@ eling pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar strives to achieve a collaboration with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal and wants to deepen your understanding that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he got tigers already from face to face : &quot;
a tiger cannot be inter@@ rupt from the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ wi@@ ks appeared . he immediately looks at us ; we look forward to seeing me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar set the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environment protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ alese and wild animals is not always easy .
&quot; he waited for 22 days long , and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ot@@ tern at the Bar@@ dia National Park recording of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he was able to photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live close to the tourist arrivals . &quot;

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az de an@@ wal@@ a and was originally posted on video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , women are avoiding the utmost care to speak the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect her husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should respect the norm to keep this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned out of the Indian state in O@@ dish@@ a , and rejected by her family and the village community , having said a married relatives with name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition also did not call her wives to name , is also common among men . however , they are far less common to fear , if at all , they should not come out of this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and became quickly the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al that is operated by the community of Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and is committed to reducing the Patri@@ arch@@ ate community . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working with the help of her video camera for seven years with the help of un@@ covering practices , such as children &apos;s healing to the ex@@ iting of H@@ IV@@ ING and AIDS infected , and guides these clubs . &quot;
they reported how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion , was the name of women who did not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem where women can easily identify .
&quot; speaking out of the name of their hus@@ bands , a Br@@ other is also maintained and never asked in question . &quot;
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not hold this , is regarded as a se@@ er@@ isti@@ g , as a woman without any morality . &quot;
tradition is so deeply rooted that we never have thought of this discussion about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning of the Roh@@ ini , whose husband had never heard their husband at home , at home trying out how it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh for a long time after the video was finished .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I can call him from now on his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage the Roh@@ ini started its first panel club .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
at the beginning of the lap Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video projection , the women trying to put the discussion with an exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; If we cannot say the name of our spouses , but they can call us what they want , means that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the brake of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women never pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she had just ki@@ cked her throughout the exercise ; a different decided to let the whole de@@ ple@@ ted frustration against him and his family , trying to curse him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in the adren@@ alin rush about it , with an ancient ro@@ also broken , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
and they held their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a wife called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put into my head : his wife could not stop his name .
another small member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she moved , she got fear and said that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini , I sol@@ le it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation ar@@ ded into force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the galvan@@ ic red spot on the forehead , which shows the spouses : &quot;
why only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the hot red point if he did . &quot;
he lau@@ ghed only and I listened to him to wear it .
&quot; the other women have not completely ended up but my , they are now in a better position , even to choose him not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every panel . &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women make sure who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days for the first time in their life with cakes ; they danced and talked about things about which they had never had thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have spoken about some things , for example like our identi@@ ties in our spouses . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things noisy , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have carried only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most it is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ine cur@@ ta , a wide shirt of a tro@@ users ; they have not entrusted them . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of dispute and discussion about the merits of their own clothes @-@ choice , morality connected with the Sar@@ is and much more , ornam@@ ent Roh@@ ini her own couple of Kur@@ tas ( upper hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming to roll : &quot;
so far we only have small steps .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then listened again to say the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are here . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women bear now at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
&quot; the women in the disc@@ ard know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the cra@@ w@@ ling for more freedom of movement , or their own clothes @-@ choice - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ating the river . &quot;
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ archy .
I am also .
&quot; however , this club gives each of us confidence that something will change . &quot;
&quot; and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families , there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes to the club and other people about what we talk about and what we do . &quot;
we are all sitting in the same boat .

&quot; a new system of ab@@ duction of smooth persons for the organization , probably for super@@ fici@@ ent purposes , disturbing the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government has now called for a number of operations to stop practicing . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
&quot; one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated , and some of the organs have been extracted . &quot;
&quot; two men were arrested and subsequently , they stood that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were exploited . &quot;
&quot; it give the local super@@ sti@@ tion , that the head of a glorious man &apos;s gold contained gold or wealth could bring , the police officers stated by Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that the following attacks on glorious men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que were registered .
another group that is the purpose of refresh@@ ments for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
&quot; this led to the fact that the UN led a mission in the South African country , to investigate this practice . &quot;
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighboring countries Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudices . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are planning to travel into the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que are the target of ritu@@ alistic attacks and warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ que police according to the latest yields of three glorious men due to their body parts .
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the black@@ ups were lod@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ way Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que said that the local police had already followed the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the glorious men .
&quot; the persecution and assassination of glorious individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Mor@@ r@@ Ã©@@ zia , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for probably aber@@ g rituals , has intensified the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief existed , according to which the victims in the head had power , the riches of the riches . &quot;
in recent days three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
&quot; Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Samantha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , who clari@@ fies that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty , Moz@@ ambi@@ que faces : &quot;
&quot; I would like to take E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ que , DAS S@@ ICH , in which the people would go on to the road , attracted sex against good notes , and women would not hurt or even their lives to make their own bread , a nation in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor ch@@ ah@@ le or glorious member for super@@ fici@@ ent purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; will be hun@@ ted to get a nation in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor ch@@ oral member for super@@ fici@@ ent purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot; that aim not to reach a wealth of wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seriousness of the phenomenon , some have the opportunity to avoid mac@@ ab@@ ren humor . &quot;
&quot; cens@@ oring Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambi@@ que and enthusiastic Twitter @-@ commercial , twe@@ et that both the boss of the district Mor@@ r@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange , as well as the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ ran@@ ged Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , both are two . &quot;

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that was probably only recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the de@@ tain@@ ted Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in international community , after his lawyer end at the end of June had been announced that he was delivered to hospital due to liver cancer at the end of June . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion , &quot; after having participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to that demanded the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China called Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; internal issue &quot; &quot; and tells a speaker ; he is not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; in spite of this , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or give him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely out of the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met end of June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to enable Li@@ u abroad . &quot;
Norway for Norway
&quot; Norway &apos;s prime minister of Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister , B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ enden refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release . &quot;
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway went down to Sto@@ u after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government claimed that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June , Norway was signed an agreement to resume the salmon , since the exports were mostly blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; once the message had spread that Li@@ u had seriously fallen ill , the Nobel committee brought his hope for an unconditional release to express and lu@@ d Li@@ u to get his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his detention , he was unable to meet its price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision where China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and permit him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the European diplom@@ ats of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us on how to overthrow in an explanation on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to stand all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet all the visits and receive them who wish them , and be able to freely communicate with the outside world . &quot;
USA and USA
&quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad , as far as it may help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; an speaker at the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary and Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June , that the message of the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the call of the U.S. message attracted an angry answer from China , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department , that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and un@@ answered comments about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; free protection and freedom such as travel freely and access to the medical care of his choice , which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and judicial system , as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mercury and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision to impose on the Chinese government to let Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally free . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o unconditional , so that it can be set in a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;
Germany from Germany
&quot; the German government of Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &apos; gets all the medical assistance he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 Summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Re@@ uters , that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could be a visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada in Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John McC@@ all@@ um called on to provide adequate medical attention to Li@@ u and to give him the possibility to move away from his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P previously told that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact anyone . &quot;
McC@@ all@@ um tells you more :
&quot; Canada invites China to release its international human rights obligation , including free speech , to uph@@ old freedom of expression and to freedom the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France with France
France &apos;s State Department called on China in a Declaration on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o gets all treatments which he , regardless of where , takes place . furthermore , his wife and his family can have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news sender , France Info already reported that the French government of Li@@ u were welcome to welcome the State Department , that there is no further information out if France will eventually take him . &quot;
Taiwan in Taiwan
&quot; on June 27th , China called on 27 June to release Li@@ u and to show a greater tolerance to those who demand peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legis@@ lators Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu by the ruling Democratic Party , China called on to allow for the sick of intellectual Li@@ u to treat yourself in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very worried in an explanation on 28 June at Li@@ u and gave us that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for whom he had been severely punished , to become a harmonious , stable and aff@@ lu@@ ent China , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I was personally very moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter of 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
&quot; however , according to the Minister of Minister K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am should be considered as a city in Singapore . &quot;
this observation has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they are compared with other countries . &quot;
he supported that Singapore should be considered as a city .
no one has asked whether New York was a democracy ...
this is where most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; turning the logic to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ed to create this valuable country , we will say that we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the semb@@ lance of escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory breach . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , present land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons for Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am led the reasons were not very pos@@ h : it defended an idea , according to which one could measure the political system of Singapore not with other &quot; normal countries , &quot; given that it inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York should be compared to equally cities that can permanently run from a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once one reaches the core issue of the subject , the good old grief of the author@@ itarian rulers are emerging , the Democrats have to be , leave the tw@@ isted logic , since they fit better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final week , the answers given in the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Ju@@ dict@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
he warned appropriate questions with no @-@ answers of rational species .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clear his opinion because they didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , thus to which country is part of our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very thankful when our precious K sh@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the trouble to take this point , if he was paid highly , in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the blog his comment , it points out regarding the reviews that you should begin to read the whole co @-@ writing of the conference so that in order to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; rather than a country , &quot; &quot; he said , why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just choices . &quot;
he left Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party long ago ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he did not mention it in this sense ! &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment with Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am who is leader of a growing generation that makes such a polem@@ ical statement .
I am over what the Minister of Minister of Singapore has said very well ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is correct and aware what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review sets the weaknesses of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; believer a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
if not on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city Singapore ?
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot;
&quot; since he plays an important role within the governance , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am is of gravity . &quot;
&quot; why do the amm@@ ers make their military service , they do not defend their city but not their land ? &quot;
who must pay our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink HR ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to the Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and was always a city : &quot;
&quot; I did not say , what I said ... &quot;
this phrase seems to have anno@@ yed a lot of Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as the defense of the country , above all , but this is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Kan@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked Sh@@ em his editors : what is the most mis@@ used aspect of your home country or home country ?
&quot; their responses will be published here as part of a continuous series , with rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , which lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is most asked me in Japan is : &quot; are you American ?
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; I am then . &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live there and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation takes place , it is considered pol@@ itely to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ or by putting personal questions . &quot;
&quot; then the standard answer is usually following the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans are perhaps bo@@ il before anger when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little that distinguishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans become a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ...
&quot; so it was already when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before 11 September . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small m@@ ap@@ he@@ ets on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
gender marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
we apparently say very often &quot; ap@@ ology . &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the tolerant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends who I admired . &quot;
&quot; I would like to make a difference , if you would like to switch from Dallas for example with Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : as &quot; nice &quot; to be referred to , is basically to be sp@@ ie@@ er - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but tragic un@@ important figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( who has their own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada was really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing in which one can come across . &quot;
&quot; be harmless , means un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and in@@ interesting to be and no attention to deserve . &quot;
&quot; this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a major part of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to only take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Can@@ adi@@ ans are not often talking about the fence across the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au joined the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
musical video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ des Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop @-@ band released in Thailand has released a music video that seized the jun@@ ta which took power in 2014 and restore the civilian government despite their opinion , the country continues . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells about what regulations he does his girlfriend .
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video does not refer to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days , this was divided on Facebook highly loaded video 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; &quot; dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists called for the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy , in@@ particular about how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
take a look at these recordings of videos that have per@@ secuted to some of the political issues that Thailand has per@@ secuted in the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; may refer to the sub@@ sec@@ ical section 44 of the provisional constitution , which has the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision @-@ making power over important national topics . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; &quot; imagination &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , politicians and other individuals who are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimes , whose v@@ ague and un@@ ambiguous rules are often used by authorities to prohi@@ bit activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit was set up in the army , supervis@@ es online content and persons who pre @-@ cast the monarchy will have per@@ secuted , criminal pro@@ secuted . &quot;
Thailand sets a stri@@ fe against &quot; L@@ esis Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Product ) .
it was declared war in Thailand on 20 May 2014 .
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue , their decision is expensive U @-@ boats to buy , although security experts they war@@ med that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax . &quot;
&quot; in the video it is even shown to be thrown into a black supplier car , before putting them into an interval camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison because it allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and that Internet users will face long ar@@ rests , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , which im@@ it@@ ated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; who was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during protests in 2014 . &quot;

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society recovered only very slowly in East @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has been over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war has been officially ended , but its scars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the deserted villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , shut@@ down , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases are living in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also referred to in Sec@@ ch@@ Asia as well as gh@@ ost cities .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here today , there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district of 16@@ ,000 people had risen almost over a decade . &quot;
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this area .

&quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story divi@@ ders of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ g@@ kow@@ kas , are symbo@@ lically known for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling and they are rarely inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is clear . &quot;
before war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens who served all of the community . &quot;
&quot; now , there is only paved road with f@@ aded splendor @-@ buildings . &quot;
&quot; the people that once lived in this place and did their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have now abandoned its district . &quot;
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty residents .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ka kas , which are still one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in your hands , they immediately move back . &quot;
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pered something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ lu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ s@@ istence industry ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal needs ) such as cattle breeding , bee @-@ keeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the district management provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I do not know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ alya as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave South Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia , &quot; she says . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial help from her daughter and insist that she is instead supporting her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you neither have a vegetable garden or house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya told that she and other villagers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman , as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot;
&quot; if holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot constantly do this - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; is calling aun@@ t G@@ alya to her . &quot; you said , we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I do not know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
&quot; G@@ aly@@ as conversation , Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when war began .
every day they remember the thor@@ n before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives , who live in central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we have recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative de@@ capit@@ ate town in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will still be something &quot; , &quot; it explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 children &apos;s money for every child .
your husband is working in the coal .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten was once found , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;
she told that it was first a very scary situation than many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost her anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was little work and all lived like it was right .
I remember every day as the city and the war were once .
&quot; as our conversation turned into the end , a little boy is over to us . &quot;
he runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ased him back .
&quot; he plays with the ball , who then cap@@ tains the hill . &quot;
a group of children now follow the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw a stones on the exp@@ ired buildings . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood that care for uns@@ ha@@ vo@@ ity in their lives .
they do not know it different .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Br@@ acking was published on April 19 , 2017 , on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants , Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Tap@@ ach@@ ula town , it is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is run by a 5@@ 9@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ i@@ kan@@ erin with a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink Bri@@ ll@@ en@@ ched and gol@@ d@@ colored ear rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bears form .
&quot; she is called Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , and she grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and shar@@ ti@@ ans that are on transit .
the hotel rather has no charm .
&quot; for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with numbers , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
&quot; there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and ha@@ i@@ ti@@ cian migrants come here . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells people in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast to call them : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you m@@ um Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some of them slept on cardboard . &quot;
it does not want to reject anyone .
&quot; they also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them medication they can not pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ sam that exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in a short time . &quot;
I asked him whether m@@ um Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; the Sebasti@@ ao Family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ sta@@ che ) , with Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acking .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to regain her husband and three children . &quot;
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then pull the direction north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tian and the Afri@@ cans were often travelling the route and that those Afri@@ cans were already speaking on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; as many of his companion , Michel@@ et lived beforehand in Brazil and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football Championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he has begun his journey to the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money , to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ rol . &quot;
I wonder if he will have contact Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave it again , &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez told that her guests often send her text messages when they are going to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith was the drive of her work .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez might be very well known here , but it is not the only spark hope for migrants to travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead @-@ sac is leading to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family picked up migrants in their small house .
it is a poli@@ cem@@ an and has noted that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants could be sold too expensive .
&quot; he has started to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tian . &quot;
&quot; some sleeping in blankets to the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was transferred to a raid on his job site from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he had fled in Honduras with his wife and his three children before people who wanted to pres@@ et money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single tear , has offered him her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa is everything again full of guests .
in the courses the travellers look calm their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests a lot of Somalia .
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems to be happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gically , because of those who have gone . &quot;
like a proud grandmother set her in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair care that you have made a close customer , some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more , boy and Old . &quot;
they laugh so upset while she is in front of me shortly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repeated every time . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants will be forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter @-@ users , both of them , &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the west of China , are compelled to install a Spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone received in the Ti@@ an@@ shan @-@ district of the town of Ur@@ um@@ qi . a cell notification , in which it indicates the district government , a surveillance app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; web cleaning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the communication , the app is said to have access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; but , col@@ Ã²@@ n@@ ated the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because she was installed shortly after she had installed the app , exchanged news with a private We@@ chat Group . &quot;
&quot; in the message of the police , the app has to determine the sources and the distribution paths of terrorists and pursue them together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ por@@ no@@ graphy websites , from online fraud , trou@@ gh and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control your own home network . &quot;
this app allows the filtering for min@@ ors to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can naturally be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers might be able to manipulate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al them . &quot;
this introduction will be in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly concentrate on the experience of users in the larger towns in the east and south , reality is very often dark for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit the unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ored and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ous Internet circuits . &quot;
&quot; the images published on Twitter @-@ based media Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( on the same , on the ground ) , showed photos from a Check@@ point , presented photos from a Check@@ point , by the police officers , in@@ audi@@ ted whether they have installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile aler@@ ts required that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without these software , they could be de@@ tained by up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; they have forced people to use devices , which are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the world .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( on the same , &quot; &quot; Plan@@ ts &quot; &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift the passwords need for a Windows operating system and thus full access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang Computer and Cell Phone in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ lers .
&quot; the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the Party of Party , minim@@ ising the distribution of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all governmental branches , authorities and the connected institutions including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office at the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report from Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned this new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities released on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a regulation with the statement to all residents and entrepreneurs , to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , not@@ ebooks , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action has been violated the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible price , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything scre@@ ams after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Su@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane came to his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you see yourself and imagine that you are alone in one place where all things are gone . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dis@@ b@@ anded and revealed a truth which is clearly visible , both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes her name all glory .
one who has crus@@ hed yourself into a list of feelings and expressions who do not allow a metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you get into the reality and get behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters turn into beings from flesh and blood , and all crying out to death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt dissolve in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of Un@@ hei@@ ls . you will be clear that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone built around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have been arrested me and my father three times , but this has not yet been tried , so that I put my lesson to &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the boss of the safety service was formulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us under evidence by even destroying the simplest concepts that we knew .
five young people were demol@@ ished during a peaceful protests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it took off , so that the city shr@@ ink the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; all neighbour@@ hoods are cov@@ eted , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , rainy , at the wrong time , even though I had no high demands on a city that is kn@@ itted to the arteries with governmental security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ce . &quot;
in the third night the things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped in the district .
&quot; I got through the silence , by shou@@ ted several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house @-@ roof . &quot;
I heard my voice contradic@@ ted by the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends made brave enough to see together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we united us to a beautiful picture that filled my expectations fully and completely fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you realize that you are free of the lamp from the lamp , but it is not interested in the scent . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you have shaken them all the way to the office of the security service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me hear , &quot; &quot; let me hear that thou shou@@ ld@@ est be called &quot; &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are only brave enough to cry , if we are not close by . &quot;
his h@@ water @-@ filled eyes set out on me .
and you eat really what to look in the eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was about my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my thing when I answered : &quot; I didn &apos;t think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I have never ceased to look into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I did not regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; and puts him in single , and his father straight away . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the st@@ ench of this cur@@ sed proposition is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a spiritual torture , which I was exposed to months . &quot;
I sh@@ outs the farm .
&quot; in the first office , I leave everything I comp@@ ose with me . &quot;
then back through the farm and into the second office that leads through a course to the single cells .
I remember all the details exactly before I cared for the space .
other than otherwise they probably shared a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share it with just one more prisoners and immediately put me away without waiting for their permission .
&quot; after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old proven communication method : with the fist to beat the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ story was a &quot; &quot; first in@@ mate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hesitation he rep@@ lied to me finally .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells lay a respectable man middle aged , which looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , there can be no distinctive visual elev@@ ators , and doctors are not available here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers this one of his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would hate him if I stay . &quot;
liar .
&quot; I would like to have had a bird @-@ shy to drive all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ eled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I still hear it &quot; &quot; all@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there must be about 10 am in the evening , always around these times the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens up .
&quot; I was always convinced that Black was the colour of the per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that made us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Th@@ under , &quot; An@@ kl@@ ung on 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
&quot; they are here , to be heard . &quot;
&quot; in order to protect the secret : to protect the security of the state and to prevent the terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their con@@ den@@ omin@@ ational Er@@ pres@@ ser@@ card and shou@@ ted the narrow perspective of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is here no land ; it is a curse to call it coexistence to transform the criminals of their sound into a mighty man . &quot;
&quot; I cared for the audi@@ ble and tre@@ ffe on Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least it comes to me so . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions , which ent@@ ailed to him , &quot; &quot; My boy , you are still young , you can start so much cause with your life than to protest this day and to protest on demonstrations that will soon become an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; I have used it to me , not to answer . &quot;
I can really no longer say when insul@@ ts and blows after a friendly conversation has become an ordinary means of communication .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said , that I had to get used to get used to be punished , although I had not done anything to make this punishment . &quot;
at punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he is called the loving &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that is probably derived from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ iced in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him , and you cannot hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; my cry liked him not yet enough , which is why they exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked whether the investig@@ ator had worked in earlier times as a trash collection , or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined , to present us from their perspective , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour , three of them are altern@@ ated , while I was still in the row . &quot;
I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice so I heard .
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling , and found no favor at all , which is why he took up an electric up@@ loaded . &quot;
&quot; electricity flo@@ wed down my entire body , enough to supply my whole area . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ nude body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect electricity leader . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must probably have been at midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again again , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot;
some hours left that came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning bet .
&quot; the door opens and the morning fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of a exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; my lord , my father needs to be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk away , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me away ? !
&quot; the j@@ ord@@ anic R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b speaks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + Community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends the majority of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he sticks to his canvas , time to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but to what one can rely on to discover is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine to discover lips .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which had been part of them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ b family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now H@@ da@@ i@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who faced the conservative majority and asks their alt@@ proven opinions about gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and Rap@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; with his music , often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestine , but he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only found in his hometown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities that reach from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by limitations , and it can feel according to their own statement with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not exist openly , he has a special dis@@ ruption against the American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refuge of the second generation , &quot; even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I do not think about my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while in water he@@ aps in two cups . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fa@@ sten from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ al law also states that public consumption of food during Ramad@@ an illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for this to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand a cup of coffee at a sen@@ sing hot young Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
basically the s@@ lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ ths of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
&quot; at times , Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially if one thro@@ ws a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one simply avo@@ ids to do fundamental things - as to drink in the public during the Ramad@@ an of water - to not land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the interior of Jord@@ ani@@ ens has canc@@ eled an appearance of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; several MPs , who support the Islamic Programme of Action - the Islamic branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual fron@@ tier of Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert @-@ say . &quot;
the S &amp; D spokes@@ man in the Islamic Coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; straight &quot; due to the sexual orientation of the singer .
&quot; many also affir@@ m the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which constitutes the old proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement made Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the j@@ ord@@ al people as a &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights , &quot; which continues to work for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is likely to be not simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but in fact a more and more evident reality reflect the cryst@@ all@@ ine reality that occurs in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work clearly . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional gender standards to cor@@ be by making his vision of the fate of Arab women , who have sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently burnt woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust .
in Jordan the number of &quot; honorary mor@@ de &quot; has risen in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary mur@@ ders reached its climax in 2016 ; however , it still occurs that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the victims of murder and domestic violence , to provide adequate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime against violence from the year 1954 , women who are exposed to in@@ tra @-@ family violence , and for their release is often a long years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will not happen . &quot;
&quot; also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known for it , not to shy away from themes which in his country has been t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , spatial , however , that he puts his music , the full explicit references to sexuality , freedom and expression is not able to separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I became a policy of politics , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; Gh@@ ad@@ eb &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs , which are in the core political , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and any other is it too . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one , in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - be faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ geneous or homo@@ sexuality . &quot;
he notices that barely anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of g@@ ays and les@@ bians and that comments on gender equality were strongly cens@@ ored until in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ ic Online@@ Programme Ro@@ ya , to later note that his comments were torn out of the context and cens@@ ored his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded with no cuts , but was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + Community and represents that intolerance towards homo@@ sexu@@ als is not talking to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ clear , a poet of the eighth century , which still remained in memory today thanks to its homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks yourself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who later should work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph@@ s , should write in the eighth century openly about homo@@ sexuality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier not it ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the Has@@ hem@@ ite Kingdom , it is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ al news service held several former governmental members and members of the curriculum with the reasoning , they have expressed criticism in social media about the problems that are rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ b opinion says only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a continuous giving and taking . Jordan has promised Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it is obvious that these changes are made from day to day at the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is dre@@ aming , as millions of other Arabs even , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dre@@ aming not only from his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region with music , art and literature will become a genuine and basic openness - and not by bombs , spreading uni@@ tions and artificial kind . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until that time , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to continue and consequently resist . &quot;
&quot; this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which you heard as student Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these great , extravag@@ ant war@@ ders are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; it thought it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory states that the strongh@@ olds , the drums , and dancing over more than a thousand years , were mar@@ ched from a time to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to force the knee . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to sn@@ ap some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
only hard to imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I have been looking forward to seeing the meg@@ uro ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two ball@@ cars are straight to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only True - and still a breathtaking way of spending his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high entrance was amazing .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely were outer appearance and body care as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peruvian youth from the crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ style . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us important harbour , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smo@@ b and illegal drugs trade are daily . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not be safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can make these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ sers of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; they compete against each other , in order to show who can be seen from them the ec@@ centric L@@ ooks ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people of this , their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and in instead of poor advice to obtain training in hair@@ dressing , which allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the offering opportunities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special educational workshops in front of the school year ahead of March and reported about some of their achievements :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only primary school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because out of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love Let@@ ters to guer@@ rilla fighters

use with friendly permission .
&quot; the following article is the edited version of the post &quot; love message to guer@@ illa , &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
this entry is published in the context of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people whom we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel ashamed of feeling affection ? &quot;
&quot; precisely this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists , Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga , from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired her to the campaign C@@ art@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ ef li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people to write guer@@ rilla letters . &quot;
&quot; only recently was their country swing for a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part , following years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces Kolum@@ bi@@ ens ) , which forms the narro@@ wing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; International was considered to mark the signing of the peace treaty , so important that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its merits . &quot;
but the colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ists is still a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
&quot; the guer@@ rilla fighters who have lived for many years in illegal warehouse , exposed to a war rhet@@ oric and around the clock increased their weapons , they must now integrate into the lives as civilians . &quot;
&quot; in turn , the Colom@@ bian company again , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guer@@ rilla fighters , they must now record their ranks and support them when building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans join together and would have to help the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did , even so far , thousands of young people have already written letters - love message to former guer@@ rilla fighters to welcome them back in society . &quot;
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for any former guer@@ illa fighters who are to be handed over to personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation arose at the world summit of Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in Bogot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the possibility to talk briefly to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , which was awarded to 2014 the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; explained that we love the people we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day of love letters , but those who forget them much needed . &quot;
&quot; he plan , he told me to share his love with people this year , which were most urgent . &quot;
&quot; thus , the plan designed to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of F@@ ARC who are now finding their place in society and to establish a new life . &quot; letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history of a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2000 letters were collected as part of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Columbus such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bogot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I never imagined that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to a UN warehouse in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bogot@@ a , to bring the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they did earlier to counter@@ balance the commands of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no commands , but letters of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all participants . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different emotions can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; &quot; told the political science student Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a assistant of the Govern@@ ors of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience so : &quot;
&quot; after we had passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of guer@@ rilla fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ code &quot; ( a kind of cottage , in which the guer@@ rilla fighters live ) , I saw a guer@@ rilla fighters who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go out , because in addition to him on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ e@@ gran@@ ates , a deadly weapon in the thor@@ n . &quot;
&quot; I said to him nevertheless , and asked , &quot; Hello , what do they just do ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I answered a letter I wrote to me someone . &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
&quot; never in my life has written me something so beautiful , so I answered it . suddenly , I suddenly started the tears of the che@@ eks . &quot;
I embr@@ aced him completely and put me beside the pom@@ e@@ gran@@ ates .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry to be the war , I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighters , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life expect@@ edly . he never had anything of life expect@@ edly . the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from hunger . &quot; I never imagined that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
&quot; but now I know that there is a society out there , which is waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
until now I only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; as a pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC had already acted in the dark .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC explained the history of the organization , their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years , we have experienced how social injustice means to develop the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help to shape the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who had never been heard before and had no choice , and to recognize that people I have often seen as monsters and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings were revers@@ ed by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the land lives , does me sore . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all people - even those who have killed and so much damage , can teach us a bit and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca , for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ers was made aware that after the dis@@ armament of peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it gives inequality , hunger and lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to stand up on the weapons and to protest for their rights ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we from the F@@ ARC now put on peace , to a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call on all def@@ ender of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring the sacrifice , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homo@@ sexu@@ als and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mailing . &quot;
with terror activists have experienced the coverage of the last few months on the persecution of men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but the threat , which is like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ worthy over the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only recorded at night . &quot;
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of their experiences with us and talked to us what has happened in the Republic .
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won several months ago , after reports have been published , which were published the deterior@@ ating , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspi@@ cious que@@ er men arrest and they hidden prisons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a Monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since their childhood , she felt that she was in fact a woman . &quot;
&quot; when they became grown , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya has not been a safe place for them so they moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group had experienced Ch@@ echn@@ ologies of the sex equal of their country@@ men , the hunt was opened at Sab@@ rina . &quot;
it was out of fear for her life and ultimately moved to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer team in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife , who put into trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hesitation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there &apos;s no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos were taken by my documents through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ app . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was right , to show some shopping lovers from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a voice of voice : &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you still want to honor the family ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
&quot; I know only that there was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital in the hospital .
apparently some women had given everything and started to cry out .
the man was flying .
the women had set up an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two head@@ f@@ aded in my right lungs .
OC Media : in which medical oul@@ try were you laid - in the men or women of women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name dr@@ on ; but the doctor did not understand and lay me among the women . &quot;
&quot; for this , I am very grateful to him . &quot;
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office door , I got it to do with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a cau@@ st name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful for that he was respectful of me .
I spent more than one month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; those demanded to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot;
&quot; they asked absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it , by going above without the streets . others wanted I had not changed my gender , that everything was only bad speech , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have body size C - what could I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some older people spoke to my mother on the streets .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that not only your family , but the entire Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she laid down a stri@@ ck on the neck . &quot;
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
&quot; at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later stood under the window a car with dark window discs and a num@@ eric plate with a 95 dr@@ on .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , I realized that something was lazy . &quot;
my human rights @-@ friends over@@ tested the numer@@ ical signs - it turned out that I was pro@@ secuted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I will not want to give up their name , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something terrible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
&quot; shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought it without sign me , without notice , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the rub@@ b@@ ish .
came to and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ app , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think , you are sure , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , in which hotel you are st@@ aking . you even know your room number . &quot;
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you stand still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about the sex equ@@ alization , however , this is a tab@@ ular topic . &quot;
some traditionally caus@@ tic elements I am still in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , this psychological barrier can not overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give me trouble as to see how the person feels that she recalls from her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what are your friends , those who are dor@@ ms ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone who spent a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during the Ramad@@ an , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramad@@ an could barely wait , and he did not shut up a new wave . &quot;
most probably they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; in order that I mean , they are likely to invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and end asking a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; through blood satisfaction has experienced . &quot;
OC Media : are there still gay men in this secrecy ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there were not very many .
&quot; if , then above all those who have no wealthy relatives or have been dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there so that they can present them later than terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be converted , you will be able to show their bodies on TV and claim they could have attacked either village or military bases . &quot;
to understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but targeted , in order to radical themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is this now just a mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated in Ar@@ gun in a half months .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown .
there was nothing new since then .
they simply took them .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was with me , when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; but until now , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , so far there have been no reports . we suggest that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know whether these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always bore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe in front of 2003 I was already known to Gros@@ ny as I lived there - and I had never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; in the end of Russia , Russia initially wanted to bring us back to the &quot; &quot; civil society &quot; , &quot; but finally thrown back to the St@@ one@@ age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were exhausted ; I had colored lashes to the tube @-@ je@@ ans and a short bar .
the security Ministry of Sch@@ aria has never saved me a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every night , especially on weekends , a whole group of people as I met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we have never been en@@ acted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; Sp@@ otte not over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say to children if they make fun of sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , they were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never met me never hun@@ ted and never be@@ aten .
OC Media : how long did this gr@@ aces change ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak on television about morality . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us , but mainly about the behaviour of women . &quot;
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
&quot; he who did before and did eight , see you at once with suspi@@ cion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic ever disappeared . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you proceed now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I still have been active as a activ@@ ist . &quot;
I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organise teac@@ up , meetings , I beg@@ ining it to the hospital and help them to get ess@@ ences . &quot;
I have no c@@ ents for this .
I discovered these people themselves when I cl@@ ums@@ y shelter .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ bern .
&quot; so nature is nature , so it has nothing to do with religion at all . &quot;
&quot; that is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you white with foam before the mouth , that there is no g@@ ays with them . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have what , the cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet , there are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , that is why it is unpleasant for me to hear what to hear . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Caucasus .
&quot; many of them - practicing Muslims , who go to the mosque and during the Ramad@@ an - live together with men . &quot;
&quot; you know , many think about Transi@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a clue . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation , in order to be exact , different lifestyles . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body . &quot;
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry , that I will be here personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I just know I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of self @-@ murder in the impover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
ir@@ onic Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; for the past few months , there has been a strong increase in self @-@ tomorrow . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August backward the des@@ perate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ eli@@ ght . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own helpl@@ ess@@ ness that may arise in@@ ability for his family , such as Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups , who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; a video shared on YouTube held the moments , after he had already ign@@ ited himself . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to delete the flames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
according to local sources the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ icide who has occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists from the site warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : it was all family F@@ athers , who felt on the basis of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable to feed their families and go on a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a majority of Iran living in Iran living in Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult to deny their liveli@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ monarchy took power over and 1925 great efforts to stop the ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most common and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and hard@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime has denied systematic jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation in the region by drought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as fishing and palm trees . &quot;
the unemployment rate among Arab A@@ haw@@ k youth has now risen to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian @-@ General Director for Co@@ operative , Work and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job to finish primary school , 55 % a further school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance .
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian @-@ Nazi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high increase in the number of self @-@ Nazi men among the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly unemployment has become more complicated . reason for this , a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z re@@ public@@ ans and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot;
&quot; as officials and institutions do not adapt Arab labor force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and force them to earn their living outside their home Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their preferences and surname to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi , as even Arabic names in the workplace will not be toler@@ ated , because the speaking of Arabic language or the Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi must endure , human rights defen@@ ist alarm , before the location becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .

why don &apos;t identify me with femin@@ ism as well as inter@@ sec@@ tional struggle .
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was adopted by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as an inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally have all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , that women still earn less money despite equal education than men . &quot;
that women are still under stric@@ ter observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come across different areas of life to a glo@@ wing blan@@ ket , and that discrimination on the basis of sex are still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced of that and I wear double and triple as well .
I am a black woman .
&quot; nevertheless : when I come to speak on skin colour , on racism , on black CIS women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , or on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , or on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , or on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , and if I mention what kind of we have been physically , psychological and verbal movement , not to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless all agree that women - all women - come together to up@@ lift their voices and sing &apos;@@ Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing the equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence an institu@@ tion@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence , which we are exposed to black women in two times . &quot;
&quot; or in addition , that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and their families earn less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres are exposed to a higher risk to suffer from domestic violence , domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I may not join a movement in whose center the white woman who ref@@ uses to take care of in@@ justi@@ ces in their mind that relate both to gender and the skin colour of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ fem@@ ini@@ ous sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; indeed 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman in her speech : &quot; &quot; for I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I refused to maintain an ideology , in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alized essence . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb , by cultural appropri@@ ation of our customs and customs , to advance your ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to give white women the importance of the over@@ l@@ apping of skin colour and gender . for some of them continue to remain the significance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them of a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different homes and boundaries from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
I prefer to aw@@ akes me full and totally by femin@@ ism and set me on the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism which was called for my dark skin and status as a woman who is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly celebrated that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
&quot; it is more important than ever before , that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the sphere that we are created for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ ens : &quot; Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing &quot; ( e.g. : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism ) says that we can defend ourselves in that way , in which they are completely safe , and in which the cultural , mental , spiritual , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered , which make the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately calling for separ@@ atism and exclusion after having read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment , I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures , as in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
&quot; due to my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman , I will be recognized as part of this paradigm . &quot;
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life is neither over@@ flowing , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;

&quot; over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - with a special request by the Kurdistan Region of Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church . &quot;
&quot; I definitely wanted to do something for the river we had lost as I was still a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of waste , pollution , and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ in Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ keeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a takes the urgency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a company located in Er@@ bil , in Iraq , and multi@@ medi@@ al journ@@ alist , filmed and published . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on per@@ secuted , little noted sub@@ cultures and is distinguished by the use of co@@ oper@@ ative vide@@ ography and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques , with whose help oppressed communities who can tell their stories their way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult struggle against violence
&quot; a group of women &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; represents expression to express their pain on women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ e@@ Women ) which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the people affected .
&quot; a police comm@@ iss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that she has nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her Ex@@ partner who had become about violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship was gone and the police said , her statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another woman bal@@ bu@@ ena made for distr@@ acts , also useful also the acoustic indicator of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman moved back to her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women do not show an advertisement at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence , to be victims of law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; content 1 bat and Statisti@@ cal 2 Inv@@ oc@@ ations and a legal system , that is nothing under@@ mined 3 of Paraguay : good approach , lack of implementation and stat@@ s &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really mis@@ worn , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for pleasures at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various specifications and reports that do not even ans@@ at@@ ed@@ ise the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the figures available are however extremely alar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , at the District State Office of 9@@ 600 ads went on account for domestic violence . at 70 % of this , it was about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace of peace . again , 86 % of the ads came here . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said they were physically mis@@ worn , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
but these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ish women &apos;s ordination in Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only few of these crimes are also actually displayed . &quot; on each woman , which in Paraguay have been re@@ funded due to psych@@ ic distr@@ acts , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; every woman , who has been re@@ funded due to physical mission , come two women who do not do this , &quot; she declared the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since Women &apos;s icide in Paraguay has no own criminal offen@@ se , the enforcement authorities may not be properly documented , as many women are killed each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 , journalists had at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ icide in the country alone . &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence through men .

invisible mis@@ uses and a legal system that doesn &apos;t under@@ takes anything
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he ins@@ isted that she called his name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but gave it up . this should not regret it forever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together . but for two years she carried out psychological violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women , and at the same time the most severe recognis@@ able : &quot;
I have never imagined that I would even be victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read earlier about it , I always thought that only women who happens to be underestimated because they are dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana use social media to report on the mission of mission by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name name , she wrote contributions on Facebook in which she described her insul@@ ts and various attacks during their two year relationship and told how he had ins@@ ulated them . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised the hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of mission . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had fallen by Carlos for so long and not left him earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost as though they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which is not derived from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner they mis@@ led them . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I think &quot; ) that consists of women all in some way victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
&quot; her prosperous partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started to beat her .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads in the authorities were without a result and also of their relatives , they received no support . &quot;
&quot; it led a process against its former partner who developed into an im@@ par@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , de@@ fici@@ ent implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was deb@@ ated in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; the original design of the law looks before , Fem@@ izi@@ d has to explain and tougher crimes , and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the legislative text was altered in a number of points in order to also pave the way for the law who feared the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are currently banned in Paraguay and punished up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was envisaged , the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process , who need to bear the victims of violence at present , if they just want to report and receive a safe accommodation to the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law was not effective , if the legis@@ lature does not provide adequate financial resources for this purpose : &quot;
in Paraguay no mission is considered to be part of human relationships .
&quot; here , a change must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something Nor@@ mal . &quot;
&quot; he who in the face of these facts are sil@@ enced , and contributes to that the perpetrators come from dav@@ elop@@ es . &quot;
we have to report as long ad until distr@@ action is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . prior to this , parts of the law were altered however , among other things , a passage has been rep@@ ain@@ ted which the partners have called domestic violence against reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; however , the stri@@ pe of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law also applies as a big set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man a year after the prohibition of a newspaper continued to be attacked .
&quot; this website was locked on account of a pro@@ vocation of the Minister of Information , &quot; is ranked on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ anic authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage on corruption in the Sultan .
&quot; You@@ z@@ Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he sentence a one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibra@@ him al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ al Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and put in court , and later came back freely . &quot;
&quot; since 1970 , O@@ man has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had set his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state dispute . &quot;
&quot; since then , he ar@@ ra@@ yed , besides his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defense , commander commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , President of the Supreme Council for the planning and President of the central bank . &quot;
&quot; the domination of the Sultan is marked by the pers@@ ist@@ ling efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic secrets , public freedoms , including freedom of press , limiting and human rights , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists , to be intimi@@ dated and imprisoned . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically , and activ@@ ist citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , closing and detention three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper since its inception in 2007 about corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , who was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . it was an article entitled &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; &quot; in the judiciary and the intervention of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused the judges of the Supreme Court in O@@ man under pressure to stand up a judgment in an inheritance . &quot;
&quot; edition of the Az@@ am@@ n Zeitung on 26 July 2016 , with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of justice . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ al Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Board of Directors , loaded from the ISS to the special department and captured upon his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS Vice @-@ chief editor You@@ z@@ Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is had been acting as chief editor . &quot;
&quot; the paper was closed at an un@@ defined time after the information Minister has given the statement , that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on every way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the court condemned the three journalists to prison quarters , and also held the final closing of the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned both among others because of the distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty to the violation of a public ban and sl@@ ander@@ ing . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and money in the amount of each 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a sentence of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2@@ 600 US dollars ) after making use of &quot; a information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for al @-@ Abr@@ i a security deposit was fixed in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 in front of the judgment .
&quot; the Court of Appe@@ al spoke free of Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari sentenced to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was freed in prison on 10 April 2017 . al @-@ Ha@@ j was still in prison on 10 April 2017 . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he sentence his one @-@ year prison sentence .
&quot; the Court of Appe@@ al also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information , to include the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the paper looks still exposed by the om@@ anische government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Minister of Information received a directive with which the closing of &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information received personally a further assignment in which the closing of &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the Minister showed another time against the decision of the decision to give the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the continual closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the paper are not the only cases where in O@@ man has recently been violated the press freedom .
&quot; for further injury , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ v@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set their operations . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to end the comprehensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities on :
1 . You@@ z@@ sef @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and unconditional release ;
&quot; 2 . to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ; &quot;
3 . protect the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man manage their ri@@ ghtful human rights work , and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial ra@@ ils . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defen@@ ders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and the right to gather peaceful , support and protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or 2016 in Zambia and picture takes place with his consent
&quot; medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned at all . this is an increasing area , which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot;
there are two reasons for the need for local research there are two reasons : for a lack of global health care many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have widespread implications in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists himself , when building own research capacities in Africa . a larger role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is director of centr@@ al@@ ab@@ ors in the Centre for the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic first engra@@ ved implications for national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself taught at HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ pled health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and on mis@@ understanding of the media about this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as a private individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or RW : the main focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ pled national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with lab tests .
&quot; furthermore , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
G@@ V : what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there is no fundamental research here . we only put solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of being on the creator . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is she sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well promoted .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
&quot; r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , continuous supply of electricity , water and Internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; r@@ w : there are interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate on , and how can we support development ? &quot;
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there are demand for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of the space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
G@@ V : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa facing Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; r@@ w : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines make items accessible only against payment ( the so called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers will change global food production
&quot; this contribution from Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports about sol@@ vents for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton joined the USA in the USA for the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA &apos;s a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was done only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sal@@ ads can get limits . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding . &quot;
&quot; patents vary not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more and more of these patents have been registered in more and more plants such as corn or cardboard varieties . because of these trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , Mor@@ ton is still salad , but he needs to do so much for this , as his work is still being continued by more and more constraints . &quot;
it &apos;s like being in a river a rock climbing around which I must p@@ addle .
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go on sal@@ ads too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new sal@@ ine variety because all the features are patented . so he makes it as good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and tried to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Sp@@ ect@@ station ISS have bred red ro@@ m@@ sal@@ at the variety of Out@@ red@@ dened in the &quot; green@@ house &quot; of the station and eaten . there is tested whether plants grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; open source &quot; software , providing alternatives to copyri@@ ghted software . &quot;
&quot; it was called into life to ensure that some plant types and acts are not protected as intellectual property , and are permanently usable for plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the initiative , in short O@@ ss@@ i , US @-@ breeders can also commit to others that others are bred and can use them freely . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders allow only others to breed their seeds , and it is not immediately selected , two aspects that are forbidden by many plant pat@@ ernity or prescribed . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the general professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i MEP , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to it , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter or only little by increasing seed with natural resistance . &quot;
&quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; &quot; open source &quot; movement is not occupied with GM plants . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , cor@@ n , genetically modified or not , from ecological farming or not . &quot; to purchase our objective of ecological agriculture , &quot; he says , and takes on the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , which , for example , is offered the merger of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Monsanto and Bayer who , for example , is offered on peasant markets , should also know that the way that the vegetables is bred . &quot;
&quot; nutrition , without seed sovereign is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ple@@ dge to provide others their seeds , and thus to pat@@ rol their actions in contrast to seeds , seeds and plant @-@ characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i @-@ supporters argue that the future of food supplies is at risk , since the available genius is due to the ever @-@ increasing intellectual property rights based on plant material , which is therefore always reduced un@@ restricted . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of O@@ ss@@ i , occupied himself in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found that about a third of all cart@@ ot@@ ten@@ ders are protected as intellectual property , thus it is not only usable for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suggests that mass@@ aged plants like wheat is patented in even bigger style than salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants become so bred that they have targeted characteristics - of such , through which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and with@@ stand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available crop material for breeders is increasing by more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently necessary , however , because the changed conditions through climate change are much worse . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Monsanto spokes@@ person recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for mon@@ e@@ tos &apos; activities is . with a total of four gen@@ ders and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States , the company supports the preservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property other bre@@ eder restric@@ ts since &quot; patents and the protection of plant varied innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is essentially taken a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has exp@@ ired . &quot;
&quot; often , these instructions can help others to come to the same result with another method . &quot;
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but also encourages them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton looks different : 20 years to wait , until a patent dating , there certainly not be innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you need to wait so long to grow to plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle already . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general public and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ate incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to facilitate their work .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept itself , plant features : &quot; we do not create the characteristics really . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them themselves and as breeders , we finally have no idea how the plants do it . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding @-@ in in the US @-@ state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i Board member , there is still another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; &quot; who owns a variety , his own values in them . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ ok@@ ul@@ tures , for their cultivation of her@@ bi@@ cide , the gro@@ o@@ ists in his varieties are taken into account of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is accurate . &quot;
&quot; while some moderate @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets but smaller than Monsanto are patents ) , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they refuse the patent or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding , or both is the case . &quot;

&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that breeders would be more innovative by the prevention of pesti@@ cides : &quot; it looks like I was with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that pat@@ rol . &quot;
&quot; I need a constant new material for my catalogue as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties over a couple of years ago , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent you can protect yourself 20 years before competition , what makes it very nice to me . &quot;
&quot; though the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; breeding , however , the concept spreads rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the Center for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; seed program , working together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties , meet certain requirements . &quot;
&quot; it also supports them to get open source &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; and to sell their own . &quot;
&quot; the German Organization Agre@@ col works on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i commitment to bre@@ eder in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for breeding are different from country to country , why the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply become one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventional plants were not pat@@ enting on the current practice of the European patent , the patents are cultivated in conventional plants . &quot;
&quot; however , a declaration is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference to &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently establishing a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental protection and development groups ( including hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit making organization US@@ C Canada and the action group to ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , published global alliance for the future of eating - a network of aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - it represents the fact that farmers have the opportunity to participate in seeds , exchange and improve seed policy , so that a stable supply of foods can be safegu@@ ar@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see him soon more people will see him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has taken care of where , and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so , Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to make people clear that even more behind their food is . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest goals of the cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still unlock content on the Internet .
&quot; this time , it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; on the weekend around the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government documented the website of the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed for this step sharply and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; in spite of this attack and the observ@@ ance of the Egyptian law and the Constitution by the authorities , which actually defend the law , to cover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I have never been so difficult to overcome these goals , so it has never been as important as it is now . we insist on fulfilling our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 web pages , such as b@@ sp@@ out on the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and that of Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of we@@ ds to victims fallen . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; beside AN@@ HR@@ I , there is also no access to the blog of the colum@@ nis@@ ts and human rights research , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no access more in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the distribution of colum@@ nis@@ ts and articles , which he does not write accessible websites and media in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he applied to the cens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ g@@ gers , which is located on the blog in the Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces , while he was reported on the student prot@@ esting , as the police exercise physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada spoke to the block@@ age by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the , which , blogs to lock is very old , but has a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ u@@ cle@@ ah @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the block@@ age of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded to convey to me the feeling of a si@@ ege ; A arrest , a attempted murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the block@@ age blogs as well as any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I was not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to the post of articles to handle the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ gs go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Thou@@ ght and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) sper@@ sed Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this led technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , e.g. Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented also the block@@ age of vendors , through the en@@ closure of internet @-@ sur and private surfing was possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , 12 of June we noticed how the block@@ age of web pages , which V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
&quot; such practice points to the intention of the government to continue to block content and to filter , to which Egyptian users could have access . &quot;
&quot; the situation in addition will wor@@ sen the fact that the cens@@ ored decisions behind closed doors are made , thus the Egyptian population has no legal basis , using court against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the people dispute .

&quot; day for day newspapers in Brazil with short head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard theme . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; E@@ den second day becomes a police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Die@@ ve ro@@ b pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Force , to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the violence in Rio reached the highest stand for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice called even called the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these are daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; published for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which they announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now being published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sex break , etc . all that happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio , is in the category &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper , that this decision was no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that didn &apos;t realize the war .
&quot; in the same video a journalist of the newspaper , that it is according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , which are controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
in the editorial the newspaper writes further :
&quot; we are aware that a war dis@@ course , if he is dist@@ orts , can also be used to dis@@ miss the atro@@ cities of the police , who only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to be confused . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose objective is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; more than they are useful ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l ar@@ gues the journalist of Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the contrary , to call violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account responsibilities in the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and worse planning - like extra when analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ counterf@@ eit neglect of public service . &quot;
memory : the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

&quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil are located according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most recent data available . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per state , Rio is up to No.@@ 16 , &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to the Glob@@ o , the largest media company South America , which stresses , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has repeatedly emphasized the security policy of the state for years . &quot;
&quot; among these security measures also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one by the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a massive police officer and a unit permanently there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually resulted in a decrease of viol@@ ating deaths . for a few years now , the U@@ PP , however , following several reports on ra@@ ils and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor municipalities which actually should protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under attack . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux made from one of his articles published in 2010 , in which he explains why the force established in Rio does not correspond to the criteria for the name of civil war . &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio has serious consequences for the human being . &quot;
&quot; for this calls the state to use the means and paths that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and is an object for &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; mistaken bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; war on or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
&quot; one week it is now that the police took the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to av@@ enge the death of a poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident arose : an orchards died as a result of nuts , who had fired the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : besi@@ eged Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
scre@@ enshot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ do@@ action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or , and I@@ d@@ lib currently around a million Syrians in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the life of hundreds of hundred civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was conducted by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , those of rebels controlled areas outside of Damascus have stood under si@@ ege , which led to residents on local or through tunnels and check@@ points . &quot;
&quot; due to the long @-@ term block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat become un@@ at@@ tainable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academics teaches the residents of East G@@ hou@@ tas as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional ones in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however their nutritional supplements makes them an attractive dietary source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East G@@ hou@@ ta .
&quot; the directing of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news Agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose the cultivation of fungi , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fighting for three years to make this project well known and expressed his relief that it is now more and more . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , we use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge for planting mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they reached over 100 % of their expected target of roughly 12.@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations from Can@@ Do in September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; due to the fuel supply of fuel , local fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators using the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began to produce the production of the regions out of the regions , before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as this managed they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the start of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed rooms for free everywhere in the east of G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom @-@ breeding for various reasons &quot; : split of si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by eating places ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) are used to produce new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
create new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea across the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege is visible . &quot;
we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese calls for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that were r@@ amp@@ ant during the week prior to Portugal in the north of Portugal .
two forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were violated as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government called out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ break@@ through@@ s , which grew out in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June occurred in Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest area by satellite recording , in Portugal alone about 500,000 acres of forest burned up - an area of the size of the Lisbon Treaty . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the gravity of the situation : there is only a fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) , 15 October , 2017 &quot;

numerous videos spread to the net and show pictures that allow better insights into the events :
the ab@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the target of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better rewards and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why civil protection was not able to in@@ dem@@ ise the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
JoÃ£o Sover@@ al by the Confederation of farmers of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
to Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do so : there are d@@ incub@@ ation reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could have been going to happen again as the streets were very late . &quot;
in addition construction permits in furn@@ aces with a high fire risk is questioned .
&quot; a far @-@ sufficient proposal to the whale @-@ form , introduced the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ection@@ able by the commun@@ es that looked at the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which permitted the cases of cases , when the applicant had an open rear door , so that everything could be built &quot; , &quot; JoÃ£o Sor@@ val pass on the same article in the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us made aware that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees made of slightly burning wood , can spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems arise that the site &apos;s website of civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as resident information searched or trying to contact relatives , offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : she used their own civil protection data using the application fo@@ g@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o P@@ ina to simplify work of fire fighting , and was so critical in this f@@ ateful weekend in October so that the server followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who pursued the fires , did not count on the website more than half a million access . &quot;

&quot; even though his mother did not say it at that time , she knew she could no longer see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
at dawn should the boy break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tractor .

&quot; Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the party of Haz@@ ara @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was just murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly un@@ vulnerable . &quot;
the Taliban on the Haz@@ ara known for their hate was always closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in direction to Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his flight , A@@ sc@@ af found himself in Pakistan again . &quot;
he worked for a couple of years he worked in a coal . the work was heavy and made him ill .
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wages , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and to@@ wing saw with mor@@ tar , the he@@ avier than he himself , to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , life af@@ gh@@ an@@ ischer refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; reminded themselves A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we loved n@@ ylon in front of the open windows that we do not swim at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ sc@@ af ordered his life without paper in Iran and made ready for travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; the dangerous crossing of the sea suffered from ship@@ wre@@ ck on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application , A@@ carto@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who distributed twice a day of food to aid . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for distr@@ acted asylum seekers . however , it is also true that the conditions to find asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the Human Rights Organization for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffering from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers will be housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centers . &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law asylum seekers can only be shared only to a recording center , if they officially have submitted an application for asylum - which can still go ahead after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for an accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
in this way it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; however , his unbeliev@@ ing life @-@ turn helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon . &quot;
&quot; after spending several years working in the construction industry several years , A@@ sc@@ af tasted his entire savings to the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
&quot; this went so well , that after a while he opened a second hostel and a schn@@ el@@ lim@@ bis@@ on . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Story story is now subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;
the movie was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of the company owned companies , including dres@@ sers , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ ans restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , where the waiter and the kitchen were largely refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ an .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ ehol@@ es goals do not reach far beyond the Italian Ga@@ stronom@@ y area and the retail of the city , and aim to go back to the country that he had to leave out more than teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily , if I know that my people suffer . &quot;
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and must get the same possibilities as everyone else .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and con@@ serving techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest over@@ flows on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; Ne@@ ver Report : legislative accus@@ ations made of Egypt allow shut@@ down social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , since more than 900 days in custody . &quot;
&quot; he reported about the clear@@ ance of the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the overthrow of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ver &apos;s report is an international snapshot , which shows challenges , victories and upcoming trends in global inter@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a draft law , which fores@@ ees the user can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users have to use to be able to use social networks , within six months of successful legislation on the website of the authority under specification of their complete name as well as their number number . &quot;
&quot; those who are dre@@ aming this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment , or to be condemned to a criminal donation . &quot;
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty parliament@@ arians , is currently under legislative acts as well as the constitutional Committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; may , another member of the law adopted a legislative proposal to be introduced into the har@@ med punishment of the President or of a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the insul@@ ting of the president as well as state institutions are already pun@@ is@@ hable . under the law proposal , such an act would however be punished with prison and monetary policy , as right @-@ wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be passed , this can make up to three years in prison for the split . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would justify a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who took photographs on 13 August 2013 , when he demonstrated violence against prot@@ esters , who had led to the military coup , who had led to the minister of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , just like more than 700 Protestant members , who were arrested in the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postponed to the 20th of May because the prisons were moved to human rights groups , accused of bringing the accused of prison in the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threatened the death penalty because of a , so many human rights groups agree that the pollution of among others arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a Trial Chamber in G@@ iza said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary ; they were indicted for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa , and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who were also arrested in advance of 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisian activ@@ ist of per@@ secuted documents cat@@ er@@ ts
may Tunisian authorities six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been heard by the President of the Republic , who expressly supports a controversial legislative draft , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption accused by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption accused officers . &quot;
&quot; on 21 April published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at published document , a light sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the legislation will look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to exclude the disclosure of his sources , indicating Article 11 of the Tunisian press , which journalists ass@@ ures the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to put forward their identity ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the information office of the State council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need to write or share news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the rules will also be stated that the registration with the full real name will be required . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st suggests that this is to be achieved by the Eli@@ min@@ ation anonymous comments in conversation within social networks , it is still unclear how the authorities apply these regulations . &quot;
&quot; Chinese ret@@ ina have proposed in the social media to enforce these schemes , in order to protect citizens journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot;
see you then in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may sper@@ ms the State cens@@ orship in Russia the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ com@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or wat@@ ered We@@ Chat , register with the provincial government as the &quot; organizer of the information broad@@ casting &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government will organise a list of online services that will make the publication of the information responsible for removing content and force them on request for the suspension of user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ d@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dis@@ comforts of other services . &quot;

&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and Communication was closed , which side had been locked , because it works to &quot; a source of information that works with groups to address a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is thus , besides amongst others China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can not stop her@@ edi@@ ble
&quot; after this week , the British government is located in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased monitoring , the internet service provider would force to monitor communications in real time and install back@@ door programs , encryp@@ t the data encrypted . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has made other technological companies and the civilian populations outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation still runs until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be passed on to the Interior Ministry . &quot;
