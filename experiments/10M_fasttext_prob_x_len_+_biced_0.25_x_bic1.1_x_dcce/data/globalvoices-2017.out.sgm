<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American films, have danced with American music, American authors and operated his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a dermatical effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"when 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pellet letter, a fearless author who was with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stued the Supreme Court of Richtern who were inclined to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after Method Man," "I was" "as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, had only amplified my admiration for the USA."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very blackish love letter on its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he goes with his mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never thinks of his opinion behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican, and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in favor of him for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes that he won in the Republican Prism, was the highest number, which was ever reached by the party nomination candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person if I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't get Trump and his voters to tune with people that I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalist program, takes people from all over the world, a deep faithful man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also with the enmumps of worldview not with the author of Peter Bhatia, the present publisher of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours with it, the" Phoenix Suns "at the game."</seg>
<seg id="25">"mumps Intolerant is also in contrast to the generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"nor does she fit to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped with a lot of patience and grace, and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were even Andrew Lecturkey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me much with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those affected by them are deepening my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump spent his way to nominee Republican Presidential candidates, they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the argument with the idea that people have voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the trump-voters as a racist.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and disrespectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of whom most know are, for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that in this America they are still important?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentated the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(anal. WC.: as much as" drawing of the White against all other ethnics "; wording from white in anchoring to the white and whiplash, which means as much as Schanddertrauma), as evidenced by the great Van Jones, exactly what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions people all over the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this land chose as his president, twice the son of a Kenji, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the White America this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America for 9 / 11 the white man is again at the ruin, say they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"for all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a manifestation for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a silently," "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" "brood the amount."</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" "they answered."</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no! they called them, and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone, who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and vociferous "NEIN!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" God is thanks, Mr. Trump, is not your America. "</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps, saying the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could no longer find a place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for a few years now, the La Banda de MÃºsica (music bande) is now playing in the community: one out of children and adults-existing symphony orchestra, which has found a way to overcome the poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and the Banden violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth therefore offered a rare hope of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young bandmembers take their commitments towards the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to meet their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come on and play with gleaming eyes and play in the Trubel you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, puboe, flute, Bongo, Bongo and Conga."</seg>

<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village which is practically located at the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments that are made of recurrent waste material:"</seg>

<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayish and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in Los Angeles Times remembers Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local economist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura, to the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first, it was very difficult because we had no space for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where parents worked in the garbage. children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact their parents, because many of them do not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: one out of waste made violin.</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights against wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, then, it was known that this ship had already been operated in purple fishing waters before the other coast of Africa was looking for."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were over accordingly, and little inclined to welcome a legislative brecher of this kind at its coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they refused to give up one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing payments."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" Ursuddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries, which you just refused, "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a leader of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority. it is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of pillage of fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"at the heart of this initiative, the criminal practices crossed and resources protects, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 was established by the NRO Stop illegally Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries who had driven the prime minister out of their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are equal and working together. they exchange information and stand up to each other where it's about illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable trusts project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden, why is illegal fishing a leading cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by clear discontempt of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm the body that have a delicate equilibrium."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snowflempo, the actions now happen in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that one had noticed during a port inspection or experience."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, if they move on the open sea via satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible to mark the authorities to mark ships that fish in bottled areas, such as suspicious passenger routes, such that a ship invites its fired fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fish-license, where they were on the road and maybe even if they have a penister."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, can deny the adoption of such ships in their ports, and that the ships could not sell their cargo to their cargo. and that they can even be forced to the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then a significant financial loss for the owner, meaning that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, leader director of NFDS Africa. the latter is an advisory firm dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the platform already mentioned was created to attract 20 million USD in lost sales, which underscore eight members of the network HISH-i each year due to illegal fishermen who invade in East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish fishing, which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also other illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"for example, practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit licences, specification of fantasies, the fish protected species and fish in nature conservation areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they are specifically taking advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make up the weaknesses of a not incomplete control system, "" says Long. "" in the past a ship was illegal and a country could then say "You dared not to walk my harbour."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say "Come to me". "and exactly this legale loophole tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspected ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has revealed criminal networks, which had counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that were used several fraudulent identities and it has found volatile ships and found it."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to his collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority for fighting crime, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations also lead us pretty much into the networks of organised crime, "" says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="130">"it builds a system, the FISH-i should help, suspects ships precise."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"Fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, also helps to record the illegal ships that are happy to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "" says Duncan Copeland, boss at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO who also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships also turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be saved by satellite."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland is therefore helping build a system which links various information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has launched a platform on Global Fishing Watch with Google and the Maritime Organisation Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide with the position of each single pertraceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" join forces with neighbours to get a better picture of who doing what is doing - this is simply meaning, "says he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at global level." "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run, in which a global system permits the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only criminals, but also deterred."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that were exploited in the past without a license, and hardly to reckon with consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now acquired a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to record Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board locks, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries", "says Kiilu." "we are a study object." "in West Africa annually, several hundred million dollars disappear through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, in 2015, six countries have joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. also, they are fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With certainty, the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions", "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member state of Somalia at the first big triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship that was under wrong flag - and not only the ship was used without a license, and were used locks network, which are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated in verboted waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the take of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing," says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative way for the protection of the oceans actually works in the entire world sea. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes about environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my father had gotten myself.</seg>

<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time he commanded me to rise up. he led me to a baracke, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - just all possible - stood."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything from that was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small piece of wickets and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that it was a great clump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day I went to the other end of the baracke, where the stolen items were dropped and entertained me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>

<seg id="238">"I mown in, and saw a couch that were tortured on men."</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>

<seg id="244">"years later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same smell came from his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately again and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed</seg>

<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">Besides La cuadra were some rooms that were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero smote a man and killing a man.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement came from above that they should be moved."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the removal of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War Crimes'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all sorts of stolen things coming home.</seg>
<seg id="269">"at that time, at that time, I had no idea what the" war "- as they did."</seg>

<seg id="288">"then the defense accused me of being a pity of this crime. I was reluctant, no problem, they can put me to the burden of what they wanted."</seg>

<seg id="299">"I always asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">They simply could have put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply chosen to kill these people. but what their corpses disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Had these people not even families whom they had been handed over to their mortal remnants?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearing of the corpse is the final abominable act that you can do to a man.</seg>

<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows via the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sincerely sorry that older people felt by the insufficient correction (the translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to overuse, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and to actively transfer active language skills to get it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with motherlanguage. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"thus, a French native speaker should translate from English to French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue, which could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for over, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English native speakers, to learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that even have no foreign employees, can make any translation work internally. then, the Japanese staff, whose English skills are considered to be the best, to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the worralled and puzzling phrases arise by mechanical translations, show that this technique can still not replace a human translator. this is particularly true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, often used T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or acceptable or at least harmless. however, by major companies or government who have the resources to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows how progress has been reached for six years to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper includes statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of planned replacement houses (on the ground, on the ground, barigai kouei juutaku) has been completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the biggest success among the three prefectures was able to record Miyagi, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed."</seg>

<seg id="643">"the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar mills were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they were unsustainable for the country."</seg>

<seg id="645">They only left the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people from the First Nations communities in Canada deal with issues that are important for them. they do they by means of Hip Hop, thanks to a number of traveling-workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, we have worked directly to schools and youth centers since 2014 workshop groups, to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio- and video-production and live appearances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten cree communities and then with the Cree Hip Hop group The Northstars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop is increasing that the young participants in talks subjects such as" cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self acceptance or whatever of them comes to mind. "</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "on which almost two dozen young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalization."</seg>

<seg id="702">"in the following song that the Whapmagistri Cree First Nation is recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the young people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip Hop group, who gave them a Strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebooksite of N'we Jinan the Strophe is available in conversion, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:"</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vividly con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we do not only have to show the faces of those who face fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>

<seg id="783">I cannot be equal to or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year-old Cousin thinks that he is Narco (German: drug dealers) will be when he is great. and it's also not normal that people hear songs about the" "heroism" "of punishment if they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, that is, as if they are scaling that have lost someone and those who have fear that something happened to them too."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories to blogged numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"insomnia of human beings is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students were justified in a neighboring village that they were" "anaesthetist." ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to speak of such tragedies, if they are not stirred and silent."</seg>

<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days, if crying would dissolve my deep feelings, but the answers is no, because I forgot how to crying. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"the journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the post" The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: one of violence referred to. "</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a fatherless and he tells that he had to teach yourself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and" "Chichi" "for the babies which are with him. this is his name for preparing the vial of water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - Unspeakable for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he said that his mother was gone."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood had been past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody bodies of his father saw, who was shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organized crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of morals for public security and government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Prosecutor's Office was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the average of 8,5 Morden per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some hundreds of hundreds of thousands who have organised crime against Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories live on the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprera Vivir El Narco "," Animal PolÃ­tico 2015 has launched the Datcodata project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country over the last four decades.

<seg id="823">"however, it raises questions about our desire for images to messages."</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a petrol station crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kicked around and exploded. in fact, 230 people came to live."</seg>

<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo has been imposed several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and they mistakenly believe in relation to the tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities in front of which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and corpse was in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the numbers could not be confirmed, but nobody stayed back to count corpses," said a citizen to Human Rights Watch. "</seg>
<seg id="842">Many have been crushed to be shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the subsequent time could be shown bilally."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army-based point in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military and the attempt at Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo to be misunderstood as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>

<seg id="851">In all of these cases the picture was presented as proof for massaging.</seg>
<seg id="852">Yet another step further bring personal comments like this example the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to supply arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture of Sange joined in Myanmar with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a flash, published by the United Nations those who could escape blows, rape and a number of dead, some by burning."</seg>

<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the count of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird to the Untranslated blog.</seg>

<seg id="1197">Why are we today here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">Why did we decide?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What did we give up in this process of timely convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developers for open source and digital activist has been in the detention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>

<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and to the general public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, Technologist and at the moment the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes are more favourable than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005, to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra is one of the most important archaeological sites in the world was the cross-crossing of numerous civilizations and here merge greek-Roman architecture types with hiesful traditions and persican influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put all this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this strike in the digital archeology and conservation has created a time of time, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"in case, Bassel has not yet completed this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I have spent my whole life with it, of freedom to dream and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English even when he was in custody.</seg>

<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet at.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other detention, how to use computers, at least theoretically, without causing them in their hands."</seg>

<seg id="1259">"in accordance with an opinion of the General Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic, which agreed to the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to get back to his old post, since the company has no disciplinarity after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many citizens do not need the promotion well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integrated de PÃºblica, a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned into an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to put the director again:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and it is even a backstage with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note of it is that the firm would also have to lead a disciplinarprocedure against the reluctance.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company apparently fails and prompted no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions."</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar the well-known social network took their posts out of the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although about the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people ostindian origin or generally used as adjective."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or both of the same (in Burmical Scripture) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of a radical nationalist movements in the word has given the word an extremely abstenance connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">Kalar's may usually be associated with racism but the word itself does not automatically emerge hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people also reported that Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts for its use being expressed."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several burial words with fundamental different meanings, which have the same letter like 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmically also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar Pae' (bell) or'kalarkaar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuse Aung Kaat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends on a rich way whether they knew how he could relieve his back pain, having a word of word."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" "healing" "(ku) + the questionnaire - resembles the racial expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech radicalists of radical nationalists, however, that Facebook must be analytical, before it all posts, which were in suspicion to spread racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">"automatism is not understood, what you write on Facbeook."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, the post is carefully to analyse and control it by checking the next words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar Pae "." "</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these three-legged nationalists spread the hate speech, got a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">"now, it is time to procure their nationalism."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone to spread the hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of keywords often become a Katz- and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored words to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author of Aung Kaat described how Facebook started to delete his posts, when he wanted to inform his friends only that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to accept the light, post and parts of content for 24 hours, because the post" Facebook Community standards did not entail "." "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech more radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post office, the author distributed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example, the Burmical Internet community to ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to decrease racism in Burma through their platform but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words will be censored even more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started without local context or technical support and so words like" "chair" "or" "inheritance curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they would have large sales, this would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has provided a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>

<seg id="1338">"Facebook was criticized for his failure, the exhilarating hate speech on his Burmical pages under control."</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women are avoiding the utmost care to speak the name of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect her husband's social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should respect the norm to keep this practice alive."</seg>

<seg id="1475">"the tradition also did not call her wives to name, is also common among men. however, they are far less common to fear, if at all, they should not come out of this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers as well as housewives, a unique club and became quickly the main theme of the city."</seg>

<seg id="1480">They reported how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in her discussion, was the name of women who did not name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem where women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"speaking out of the name of their husbands, a Brother is also maintained and never asked in question."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not hold this, is regarded as a seeristig, as a woman without any morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we never have thought of this discussion about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning of the Rohini, whose husband had never heard their husband at home, at home trying out how it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still weigh for a long time after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I can call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage the Rohini started its first panel club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the lap Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women trying to put the discussion with an exercise in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," "If we cannot say the name of our spouses, but they can call us what they want, means that they do not respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the brake of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women never pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she had just kicked her throughout the exercise; a different decided to let the whole depleted frustration against him and his family, trying to curse him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in the adrenalin rush about it, with an ancient roalso broken, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a wife called Rohini and asked what ideas they put into my head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another small member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she moved, she got fear and said that there was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," Rohini, I solle it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation arded into force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the galvanic red spot on the forehead, which shows the spouses:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would carry the hot red point if he did."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to him to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely ended up but my, they are now in a better position, even to choose him not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip at every panel."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women make sure who could hear what could hear," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in recent months, they celebrated their own birthdays for the first time in their life with cakes; they danced and talked about things about which they had never had thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have spoken about some things, for example like our identities in our spouses."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things noisy, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most it is okay, but some wanted a saline curta, a wide shirt of a trousers; they have not entrusted them."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of dispute and discussion about the merits of their own clothes-choice, morality connected with the Saris and much more, ornament Rohini her own couple of Kurtas (upper hemden) in a discussion round, so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next they have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure to create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly coming to roll:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we only have small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then listened again to say the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are here."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women bear now at any time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"the women in the discard know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the crawling for more freedom of movement, or their own clothes-choice - at the end of a difficult to navigating the river."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"however, this club gives each of us confidence that something will change."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families, there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes to the club and other people about what we talk about and what we do."</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"however, according to the Minister of Minister K. Shanmugam should be considered as a city in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they are compared with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">No one has asked whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," turning the logic to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore. "</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrificed to create this valuable country, we will say that we are not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory breach."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, present land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons for Shanmugam led the reasons were not very posh: it defended an idea, according to which one could measure the political system of Singapore not with other" normal countries, "given that it inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York should be compared to equally cities that can permanently run from a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once one reaches the core issue of the subject, the good old grief of the authoritarian rulers are emerging, the Democrats have to be, leave the twisted logic, since they fit better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the final week, the answers given in the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judictative, our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He warned appropriate questions with no-answers of rational species.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clear his opinion because they didn't understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city is, thus to which country is part of our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very thankful when our precious K shmugam would take the trouble to take this point, if he was paid highly, in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by clicking on the blog his comment, it points out regarding the reviews that you should begin to read the whole co-writing of the conference so that in order to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"he said that Singapore is rather a" city "rather than a country," "he said, why the elections in Singapore are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just choices."</seg>
<seg id="1712">He left Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party long ago?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as he said, Singapore" is not a country, "he did not mention it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment with Shanmugam who is leader of a growing generation that makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am over what the Minister of Minister of Singapore has said very well...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that is another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is correct and aware what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review sets the weaknesses of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "believer a mistake" "or was it a Freudian speaker?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the governance, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam is of gravity."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the ammers make their military service, they do not defend their city but not their land?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink HR?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade to the Bejahung, Singapore is and was always a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say, what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This phrase seems to have annoyed a lot of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements such as the defense of the country, above all, but this is not quite true."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, which lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most asked me in Japan is: "are you American?</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I am sorry," "I am then." "I come from Canada." "since 1994 I live there and again in Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on what situation takes place, it is considered politely to show interest in his interlocutor by putting personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"then the standard answer is usually following the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians are perhaps boil before anger when they are held for Americans, but I don't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who does not know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians become a Canadian flag well visible on their backpack if they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans on the other hand...</seg>

<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamps "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: as" nice "to be referred to, is basically to be spieer - like the good-natured, gentle, but tragic unimportant figure Ned Flanders from" The Simpson "(who has their own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada was really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" "nice" "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing in which one can come across."</seg>
<seg id="1771">"be harmless, means unobtrusive and ininteresting to be and no attention to deserve."</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen around one."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go far as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone, a major part of Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to only take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders describe as "nice" is perhaps just cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians are not often talking about the fence across the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends."</seg>

<seg id="1902">"she is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula, and she grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name of Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and shartians that are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel rather has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with numbers, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>

<seg id="1909">Where are you mum Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>

<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave it again," "he answers smiling." we will always stay in touch. "</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez told that her guests often send her text messages when they are going to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith was the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she does not know much about Africa, but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken like in Ghana."</seg>

<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>

<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants travels through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>

<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said, that I had to get used to get used to be punished, although I had not done anything to make this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">At punishment in all their diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He is called the loving "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe that is probably derived from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoiced in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you can't measure you with him, and you cannot hold your cry."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my cry liked him not yet enough, which is why they exchanged the pipe through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"during my first arrest, I asked whether the investigator had worked in earlier times as a trash collection, or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had four cables intertwined, to present us from their perspective, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within a single hour, three of them are alternated, while I was still in the row."</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice so I heard.</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noted the cooling, and found no favor at all, which is why he took up an electric uploaded."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed down my entire body, enough to supply my whole area."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my half-nude body, stretched out on the ground, was the perfect electricity leader."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must probably have been at midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">"I decided to sleep again again, let's say that was my only option."</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours left that came to me as minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning bet.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning fills the room" .Raus with you, Arschficker. "</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answered with the voice of a exhausted young man:" "my lord, my father needs to be fearful."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and walk away, you will be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">This was new.</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the jordanic Rapper Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of the LGBTQ + Community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the majority of his time indoors; sometimes he sticks to his canvas, time to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But to what one can rely on to discover is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine to discover lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house, which had been part of them since 1967; the year in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaib family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years now Hdaib is a passionate activist who faced the conservative majority and asks their altproven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and Rapture."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestine, but he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only found in his hometown Amman Relevance, but also in cities that reach from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by limitations, and it can feel according to their own statement with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not exist openly, he has a special disruption against the American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, something to do with his identity as" Palestinian refuge of the second generation, "even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think about my own circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, "while in water heaps in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fasten from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordal law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for this to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand a cup of coffee at a sensing hot young Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the slukewarm coffee and the waths of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"at times, Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially if one throws a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"for this reason, one simply avoids to do fundamental things - as to drink in the public during the Ramadan of water - to not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the interior of Jordaniens has canceled an appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"several MPs, who support the Islamic Programme of Action - the Islamic branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontier of Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert-say."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The S & D spokesman in the Islamic Coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "straight" due to the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also affirm the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which constitutes the old proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement made Mashrou'Leila the jordal people as a" progressive supporter of human rights, "which continues to work for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is likely to be not simply shallow rhetoric, but in fact a more and more evident reality reflect the crystalline reality that occurs in Hdaibs's work clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib traditional gender standards to corbe by making his vision of the fate of Arab women, who have sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a apparently burnt woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In Jordan the number of "honorary morde" has risen in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary murders reached its climax in 2016; however, it still occurs that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the victims of murder and domestic violence, to provide adequate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime against violence from the year 1954, women who are exposed to intra-family violence, and for their release is often a long years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will not happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known for it, not to shy away from themes which in his country has been taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is politically, spatial, however, that he puts his music, the full explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression is not able to separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I became a policy of politics," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lavla al 3aib" "and in" "Ghadeb" "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are in the core political, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and any other is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one, in his words," what you want "- be faith or non-faith, heterogeneous or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that barely anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on gender equality were strongly censored until in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordic OnlineProgramme Roya, to later note that his comments were torn out of the context and censored his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded with no cuts, but was only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib acquires openly for the Arab LGBTQ + Community and represents that intolerance towards homosexuals is not talking to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuclear, a poet of the eighth century, which still remained in memory today thanks to its homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks yourself: if Abu Nuwhat, who later should work on behalf of the Caliphs, should write in the eighth century openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanier not it?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemite Kingdom, it is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordal news service held several former governmental members and members of the curriculum with the reasoning, they have expressed criticism in social media about the problems that are rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the concert of Hdaib opinion says only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanier."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a continuous giving and taking. Jordan has promised Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it is obvious that these changes are made from day to day at the heart of the jordan society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib is dreaming, as millions of other Arabs even, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreaming not only from his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region with music, art and literature will become a genuine and basic openness - and not by bombs, spreading unitions and artificial kind. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until that time, Hdaib will continue to continue and consequently resist."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"this report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which you heard as student Fellow."</seg>

<seg id="2150">"these great, extravagant warders are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it thought it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory states that the strongholds, the drums, and dancing over more than a thousand years, were marched from a time to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to force the knee."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>

<seg id="2157">I have been looking forward to seeing the meguro gajoen for a long time: two ballcars are straight to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only True - and still a breathtaking way of spending his summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the post" love message to guerilla, "which has released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">This entry is published in the context of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people whom we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel ashamed of feeling affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"precisely this question went to the two young Colombian activists, Leonardo PÃ¡rraga, from the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspired her to the campaign Cartas por la Reef liaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), the young people to write guerrilla letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently was their country swing for a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part, following years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces Kolumbiens), which forms the narrowing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"International was considered to mark the signing of the peace treaty, so important that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">But the columbianists is still a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"the guerrilla fighters who have lived for many years in illegal warehouse, exposed to a war rhetoric and around the clock increased their weapons, they must now integrate into the lives as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"in turn, the Colombian company again, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, they must now record their ranks and support them when building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians join together and would have to help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did, even so far, thousands of young people have already written letters - love message to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for any former guerilla fighters who are to be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation arose at the world summit of Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian the possibility to talk briefly to Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded to 2014 the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"explained that we love the people we love, on Valentine's Day of love letters, but those who forget them much needed."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, he told me to share his love with people this year, which were most urgent."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus, the plan designed to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of FARC who are now finding their place in society and to establish a new life." letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history of a common history of peace, "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2000 letters were collected as part of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Columbus such as Cali, Manicales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never imagined that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to a UN warehouse in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bogota, to bring the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves up as they did earlier to counterbalance the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no commands, but letters of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all participants." it's incredible how many different emotions can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "" told the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a assistant of the Governors of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience so:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Camcode "(a kind of cottage, in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go out, because in addition to him on the bed was a MGL pomegranates, a deadly weapon in the thorn."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I said to him nevertheless, and asked," Hello, what do they just do? "he answered," I answered a letter I wrote to me someone. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life has written me something so beautiful, so I answered it. suddenly, I suddenly started the tears of the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and put me beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry to be the war, I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighters, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life expectedly. he never had anything of life expectedly. the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from hunger. "I never imagined that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society out there, which is waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"as a prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC had already acted in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC explained the history of the organization, their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process:" many years, we have experienced how social injustice means to develop the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help to shape the society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who had never been heard before and had no choice, and to recognize that people I have often seen as monsters and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings were reversed by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the land lives, does me sore."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all people - even those who have killed and so much damage, can teach us a bit and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono Cauca, for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbianers was made aware that after the disarmament of peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it gives inequality, hunger and lack of education, healthcare and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to stand up on the weapons and to protest for their rights (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we from the FARC now put on peace, to a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call on all defender of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring the sacrifice, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful for that he was respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"those demanded to return to Chechnya, to prove that it was all a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they asked absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it, by going above without the streets. others wanted I had not changed my gender, that everything was only bad speech, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body size C - what could I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke to my mother on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world that not only your family, but the entire Republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"my mother became too much, and she laid down a strick on the neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"at the time, I had to change the apartment several times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later stood under the window a car with dark window discs and a numeric plate with a 95 dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, I realized that something was lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends overtested the numerical signs - it turned out that I was prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I will not want to give up their name, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something terrible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">"shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without sign me, without notice, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came to and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via Whatsapp, I got a message:" you don't think, you are sure, just because you have left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, in which hotel you are staking. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you stand still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about the sex equalization, however, this is a tabular topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally caustic elements I am still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, this psychological barrier can not overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give me trouble as to see how the person feels that she recalls from her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what are your friends, those who are dorms?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone who spent a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could barely wait, and he did not shut up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most probably they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"in order that I mean, they are likely to invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and end asking a proof that the so-called" honour "through blood satisfaction has experienced."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men in this secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there were not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all those who have no wealthy relatives or have been dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there so that they can present them later than terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be converted, you will be able to show their bodies on TV and claim they could have attacked either village or military bases."</seg>
<seg id="2334">To understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but targeted, in order to radical themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a mutation or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was incarcerated in Argun in a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was with me, when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"but until now, they were not presented as bandits, so far there have been no reports. we suggest that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always bore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I believe in front of 2003 I was already known to Grosny as I lived there - and I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999 when the sharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"in the end of Russia, Russia initially wanted to bring us back to the" "civil society", "but finally thrown back to the Stoneage."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had colored lashes to the tube-jeans and a short bar.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security Ministry of Scharia has never saved me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny, there was a place where every night, especially on weekends, a whole group of people as I met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been enacted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "Spotte not over the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children if they make fun of sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, they were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never met me never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this graces change?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak on television about morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us, but mainly about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">"he who did before and did eight, see you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic ever disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you proceed now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I still have been active as a activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organise teacup, meetings, I begining it to the hospital and help them to get essences."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I clumsy shelter.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature is nature, so it has nothing to do with religion at all."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"that is exactly the same as Tschetschenen, who want to make you white with foam before the mouth, that there is no gays with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have what, the cabardines have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet, there are - but" not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, that is why it is unpleasant for me to hear what to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">"many of them - practicing Muslims, who go to the mosque and during the Ramadan - live together with men."</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about Transidentity to men who love men and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a clue."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation, in order to be exact, different lifestyles."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry, that I will be here personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion which was adopted by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves as an intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well-thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminist and why we generally have all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, that women still earn less money despite equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under stricter observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come across different areas of life to a glowing blanket, and that discrimination on the basis of sex are still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of that and I wear double and triple as well.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"nevertheless: when I come to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black CIS women, on black women in the LGBTQ community, or on black women in the LGBTQ community, or on black women in the LGBTQ community, or on black women in the LGBTQ community, and if I mention what kind of we have been physically, psychological and verbal movement, not to mention many white feminists and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but nevertheless all agree that women - all women - come together to uplift their voices and sing'Kumbaya, my lord 'to sing the equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about sexualised violence an institutionalized form of racist violence, which we are exposed to black women in two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or in addition, that black women and women of other ethnicities and their families earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres are exposed to a higher risk to suffer from domestic violence, domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I may not join a movement in whose center the white woman who refuses to take care of injustices in their mind that relate both to gender and the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminious sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"indeed 1851 in her speech:" "I am not a woman in her speech:" "for I am not a woman?" "and I refused to maintain an ideology, in which the black woman is a human and marginalized essence."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb, by cultural appropriation of our customs and customs, to advance your egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to give white women the importance of the overlapping of skin colour and gender. for some of them continue to remain the significance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them of a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different homes and boundaries from white feminism, the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to awakes me full and totally by feminism and set me on the movement of Womanism which was called for my dark skin and status as a woman who is so stubbornly celebrated that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">"it is more important than ever before, that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the sphere that we are created for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womens:" Reclaiming "(e.g.: Africa-Womanism) says that we can defend ourselves in that way, in which they are completely safe, and in which the cultural, mental, spiritual, physical, and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which make the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately calling for separatism and exclusion after having read these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanist environment, I can uplift black women and women of other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">"due to my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman, I will be recognized as part of this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life is neither overflowing, nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2470">"in this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I definitely wanted to do something for the river we had lost as I was still a child," says Musa. "</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and processed version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weilicheineWomen) which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the people affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissar said Ada BÃ¡ez, that she has nothing against Luis Balbuena, her Expartner who had become about violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship was gone and the police said, her statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another woman balbuena made for distracts, also useful also the acoustic indicator of Ada BÃ¡ez nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman moved back to her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women do not show an advertisement at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence, to be victims of law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 bat and Statistical 2 Invocations and a legal system, that is nothing undermined 3 of Paraguay: good approach, lack of implementation and stats"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women are really misworn, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for pleasures at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay." there are various specifications and reports that do not even ansatedise the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay. "</seg>
<seg id="2491">The figures available are however extremely alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, at the District State Office of 9600 ads went on account for domestic violence. at 70% of this, it was about violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace of peace. again, 86% of the ads came here."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women said they were physically misworn, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayish women's ordination in Ana Baiardi, only few of these crimes are also actually displayed." on each woman, which in Paraguay have been refunded due to psychic distracts, 9 women who do not do this. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"every woman, who has been refunded due to physical mission, come two women who do not do this," she declared the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since Women's icide in Paraguay has no own criminal offense, the enforcement authorities may not be properly documented, as many women are killed each year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016, journalists had at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country alone."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence through men.</seg>

<seg id="2513">"many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised the hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of mission."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had fallen by Carlos for so long and not left him earlier."</seg>

<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">Rw: there is no fundamental research here. we only put solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this must change, otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of being on the creator."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use it here."</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is she sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for projects?</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers will change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this contribution from Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports about solvents for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton joined the USA in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as Outrageous, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA's astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was done only by its own ingenuity and the question of how many salads can get limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents vary not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more and more of these patents have been registered in more and more plants such as corn or cardboard varieties. because of these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of ancient tradition, Morton is still salad, but he needs to do so much for this, as his work is still being continued by more and more constraints."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's like being in a river a rock climbing around which I must paddle.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "he says." I think these patents go on salads too far. "</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new saline variety because all the features are patented. so he makes it as good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and tried to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Spectstation ISS have bred red romsalat the variety of Outreddened in the "greenhouse" of the station and eaten. there is tested whether plants grown in space.</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" "open source" "seed) can be inspired by the movement for free" "open source" software, providing alternatives to copyrighted software. "</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was called into life to ensure that some plant types and acts are not protected as intellectual property, and are permanently usable for plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the context of the initiative, in short Ossi, US-breeders can also commit to others that others are bred and can use them freely."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders allow only others to breed their seeds, and it is not immediately selected, two aspects that are forbidden by many plant paternity or prescribed."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the general professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi MEP, Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to it, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter or only little by increasing seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">"Kloppenburg stresses that the" "open source" movement is not occupied with GM plants. "</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological farming or not." to purchase our objective of ecological agriculture, "he says, and takes on the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, which, for example, is offered the merger of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer who, for example, is offered on peasant markets, should also know that the way that the vegetables is bred."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"nutrition, without seed sovereign is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative pledge to provide others their seeds, and thus to patrol their actions in contrast to seeds, seeds and plant-characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi-supporters argue that the future of food supplies is at risk, since the available genius is due to the ever-increasing intellectual property rights based on plant material, which is therefore always reduced unrestricted."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, occupied himself in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found that about a third of all cartottenders are protected as intellectual property, thus it is not only usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, such estimates do not exist yet, but experts like Luby suggests that massaged plants like wheat is patented in even bigger style than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants become so bred that they have targeted characteristics - of such, through which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available crop material for breeders is increasing by more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently necessary, however, because the changed conditions through climate change are much worse."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for monetos' activities is. with a total of four genders and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States, the company supports the preservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property other breeder restricts since" patents and the protection of plant varied innovations. "" a patent is essentially taken a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">"often, these instructions can help others to come to the same result with another method."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but also encourages them by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: 20 years to wait, until a patent dating, there certainly not be innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you need to wait so long to grow to plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle already."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general public and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetate incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to facilitate their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will be impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interferes with the concept itself, plant features:" we do not create the characteristics really. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do it."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding-in in the US-state Oregon and Ossi Board member, there is still another important aspect of plant breeding:" "who owns a variety, his own values in them."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monokultures, for their cultivation of herbicide, the grooists in his varieties are taken into account of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is accurate. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some moderate-sized companies (such that move on international markets but smaller than Monsanto are patents), they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they refuse the patent or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding, or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding garden Salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeders would be more innovative by the prevention of pesticides:" it looks like I was with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patrol. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need a constant new material for my catalogue as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties over a couple of years ago," says he. "with a patent you can protect yourself 20 years before competition, what makes it very nice to me."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"though the US seems to be a leader in the" "open source" "breeding, however, the concept spreads rapidly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the Center for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, an" open source "seed program, working together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties, meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"it also supports them to get open source" "open source" "and to sell their own."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organization Agrecol works on an" open source "license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi commitment to breeder in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding are different from country to country, why the Ossi obligation cannot simply become one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventional plants were not patenting on the current practice of the European patent, the patents are cultivated in conventional plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, a declaration is not yet a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference to" open source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for" open source "seed systems, explains that the organization is currently establishing a global alliance for" open source "seed systems."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental protection and development groups (including hivos, the international nonprofit making organization USC Canada and the action group to erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, published global alliance for the future of eating - a network of aid organizations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - it represents the fact that farmers have the opportunity to participate in seeds, exchange and improve seed policy, so that a stable supply of foods can be safeguarded."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between Luby von Ossi hopes to see him soon more people will see him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has taken care of where, and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so, Luby." we are trying to make people clear that even more behind their food is. "</seg>

<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still unlock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">"this time, it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist."</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend around the 05.August, the Egyptian government documented the website of the" Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world. "</seg>
<seg id="2724">"August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticized for this step sharply and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"in spite of this attack and the observance of the Egyptian law and the Constitution by the authorities, which actually defend the law, to cover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as now. ANHRI have never been so difficult to overcome these goals, so it has never been as important as it is now. we insist on fulfilling our task."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 web pages, such as bspout on the independent news page MADA Masr, arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and that of Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera because of alleged" support of terrorism.

<seg id="2729">"Ziada took advantage of his blog for the distribution of columnists and articles, which he does not write accessible websites and media in Egypt."</seg>

<seg id="2731">"bloggers, which is located on the blog in the Ziadas blog, on the other hand, is further accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces, while he was reported on the student protesting, as the police exercise physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada spoke to the blockage by the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the, which, blogs to lock is very old, but has a priority in the era of Abdelucleah-Sisi; and even if the blockage of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has succeeded to convey to me the feeling of a siege; A arrest, a attempted murder, unloading at the National Security Council, the blockage blogs as well as any other website for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I was not in vain. in other words, my words have influence, if only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to the post of articles to handle the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mugs go the way up to the end.</seg>

<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, 12 of June we noticed how the blockage of web pages, which VPNs began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"such practice points to the intention of the government to continue to block content and to filter, to which Egyptian users could have access."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation in addition will worsen the fact that the censored decisions behind closed doors are made, thus the Egyptian population has no legal basis, using court against these actions."</seg>
