this is James R@@ isen .
they perhaps know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times .
&quot; long before anyone of Edward Snow@@ den had heard , R@@ isen wrote a book in which it was spectacular , that the NSA heard illegal phones from Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , where the CIA has literally been dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb . &quot;
&quot; if the crazy sounds , you can read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not fall at all ?
the US government .
&quot; for nearly 10 years , the government has chosen against R@@ isen and called it to name its alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol for the pattern of government , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to condemn and escal@@ ate journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the first Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right , if media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of those who they would like . &quot;
&quot; so as the government of R@@ isen anch@@ ors , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters already did before him , he refused and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they were for years that it would be indispensable for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porters and sources can still hide less .
&quot; instead of having to fail and bring forth R@@ isen statements , that could do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without its consent , his phone call is secret , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its loan agreement , and even rice @-@ wise with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to denoun@@ ce Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA wh@@ istle @-@ wh@@ istle and Ris@@ ks supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect against his attack , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to protect . but instead , the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work as secret . &quot;
since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wer that went to a journalist .
&quot; so we set the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional bodies , because the government has more and more possibilities to pronoun@@ ce all of them . &quot;
&quot; however , just like technology of the government allowed the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; while they can do that from the moment in which they contact , rather than in retrosp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; today , there are communication software that has not yet been written when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer than regular e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transfer system for wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers who was originally developed from the internet @-@ famous , which by us received Aaron Swar@@ tz , has been developed and today was developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents up@@ loading or send information , just as in any common contact form . &quot;
&quot; these will be encrypted and stored on a server , where only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot collect more information secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ y technologies that are all end@@ anger us . &quot;
&quot; it is up to us to ensure that not only technology den@@ omin@@ ator like Edward Snow@@ den have a way to put iniquity . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; the information about dis@@ appearances in the supply of soldiers is humble and he wants to report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental labor@@ ers , which suggests alarm to contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a pilgrimage in@@ sider that warned us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest Dat@@ le@@ ck of History was released . &#93; &#91; the &quot; &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &quot; revealed that friction and powerful &#93; have hidden in tax hav@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; we were sour@@ ced by news about a l@@ eck of 11 million documents of the estate law firm in Panama in Panama . &#93; &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say , &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works , how it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
&quot; also , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad Brief@@ k@@ ast@@ en@@ ames has in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it claims that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin performs , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous about the next release , and to the next revealed documents . &quot;
&quot; well , it sounds like the P@@ lot of an agency &apos;s name or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel . &quot;
&quot; it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we address what ?
&quot; but the truth is , if the rich and powerful is able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and do not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this affects all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global W@@ ard , these revelations are phenomenal . &quot;
&quot; the whole world will discuss media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens to hide from a few times to hide their assets and wear it -- something that we have been discussing and revealing it for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people appear this whole world very confusing , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens function . &quot;
I always place it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ sel .
&quot; so one has a firm in another company , in another company , in another company that makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; probably , because there were no prominent Americans in this revelations , that scandal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; however , by the principle , after which these tax hav@@ ens function , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a database of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is that you need less information in some US @-@ states to provide less information to establish a company than to obtain a libr@@ arian . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparent in the US has allowed employees from school districts to pick school children .
it has allowed to sc@@ ams especially tense investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global W@@ ard we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does that work ?
&quot; so , we sent a covered investig@@ ator in the offices of 13 lawyers companies in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ator was born as an African Minister , who wanted to bring money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we truly pointed out that all up to a lawyer of our investig@@ ator proposals made proposals , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ dict@@ ations . none of these lawyers participated us as clients , and of course , no one was handed over to it , but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as single cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our dec@@ eived investig@@ ator .
&quot; it is not about a single market policy , involved in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
&quot; this may sound very dre@@ amy , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing has ever been altered , as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; however , as a born optim@@ ist , I see that some changes have begun to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen more transparency towards more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies . &quot;
&quot; the topic took place political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; since then , the EU has captured central reg@@ isters at the national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global W@@ ard this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy , who stand up and say : &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and campa@@ igning for it , to end laws these kinds of transparency . &quot;
&quot; together , we can finally terminate the in@@ transparent that allows us to finish this type of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard res@@ ale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my belon@@ gings .
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and just made a road@@ trip all the country . after that , he would go to the peac@@ cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him on a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where sleeps you tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; I do not know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who knows the situation not ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a ma@@ z@@ est ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; ä@@ h , as please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I was sitting at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh dear ! what did I get into it ? &quot;
a wild sea sleeping in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , shut up on toe nails , and my sleeping room door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the artwork that he had bought from me today in his classroom , he is now a teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered . &quot;
&quot; people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; do we make a jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my room@@ mates withdraw from and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I survived how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk inclusive , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we asked a website and set so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors with us for 20 dollars .
they found it super and we too .
I &apos;m sure about our che@@ eses of ham and mel@@ ted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we had passed the last guest , and the door to the castle fell , ro@@ cking Brian and I am approaching . &quot;
had we discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came to the re@@ els .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make this a business concept .
&quot; we presented to investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , their doors , whose doors are closed if you visit . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite the wild people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the missi@@ le would ign@@ ite .
&quot; act , however , it is not . &quot;
&quot; no one who is still very con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a business that allowed strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , one feels on the things you can get good . we could design@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design@@ ate objects but now we wanted to create trust through design and trust , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design make such a difference ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
&quot; I would like to give you a precious sample , which degree we give confidence . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ lock@@ out mobile phone to your left seat .
&quot; this silent approach of panic , you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time . &quot;
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the conce@@ al cell of a stranger in your hands ?
most of them feel the responsibility .
&quot; so , most of the guests feel when they stay elsewhere . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; only so , who now has Al Gor@@ it &apos;s cell phone ? &quot;
could you announce to Twitter that he is can@@ al@@ ded to the Office of the President ?
you can now reset your mobile phones .
they have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour would only be presented with his name : if he had told , wh@@ ence he comes , how his dog or his children would be called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine , you would have 150 assessments that are all saying : &quot; &quot; he really can hold very well de@@ pressed phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you have to leave your mobile phone ?
for a well @-@ designed feedback system strengthens the confidence crucial .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to prevent negative assessments .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their ratings before we created them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined , how most likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and residence . &quot;
very surprising we trust the people most who are most like .
the more differences we find the less we trust .
this is a natural social lecture .
thrilling will add it when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by Be@@ ur@@ als .
if one has less than three ratings does not change .
&quot; but , one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation is similarities .
the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get off . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little about how &quot; &quot; hi ! &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; tell too much , like for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; T@@ olle art@@ works in your home ! I do my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics one should write some .
&quot; our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help , overcome our prejudices against foreigners . &quot;
&quot; what we had not reck@@ oned , was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put these prejudices . &quot;
here you can see how many people use our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , I am incredibly good luck . &quot;
&quot; second , the tirel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; third : a need , which had not been covered before . &quot;
for us the business runs very well .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have dwell@@ ed dwell@@ ings .
hosts have guests in the rain .
&quot; at the beginning of the project , I have been working in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot;
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing bad than these calls . it already hur@@ ts if I just think about it .
&quot; the disappointment , which you hear in the voice of the attack , was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the 123 million left nights had only a fraction of the problem . &quot;
because people trust each other right .
&quot; if trust works , it can be wonderful . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host took him to the hospital .
he even don@@ ates blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers , who tend to be co@@ habit@@ ual due to sitting activities . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra , Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real prot@@ ector that can save life even though they do not know a real thing . &quot;
&quot; you go to hospital in your own car when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
because they don &apos;t want you feel lonely and they bring books over .
you can even stay longer without charge the extra @-@ night stay .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course not every stay will run away .
but these relations behind pure money transfer are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing with money transactions together ?
it is here about economic commerce .
&quot; but it is now just a &quot; &quot; rent industry &quot; , &quot; the thing will not do justice . &quot;
&quot; Share Economy describes a trade , the human relationship promises . &quot;
&quot; humans put a part of himself open , and that changes all . &quot;
&quot; if you travel nowadays , this is fast to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
&quot; what would , however , if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be ? &quot;
&quot; what if in any place you visited , a group of Ans@@ wer would wait to re@@ fill a thoroughly and to show a pub in a pub that has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could cook cooking of a five @-@ star chef ?
these days are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to design apartments from scratch ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would have to take the thought of a common part ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the Government , &quot;
&quot; now , the inhabitants were offered . students who were looking for a lead , &quot;
&quot; to convey to people whose children were moved . there were In@@ cub@@ ator programs , &quot;
to finance new Start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . about our platform alone will be 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries guest at a stranger or even host .
so the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
&quot; hospitality , there was also before . &quot;
there were similar sites in front of us .
so why has just our works ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudices .
&quot; I find the amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I need to think about it when a red Maz@@ da goes over to me .
we of course know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or sup@@ pressed , a brain @-@ washing , a terrorist militia ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not blame you for your negative impressions .
this is how the media represent people look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think the most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Moslems , It is great to meet you . &quot;
I say to you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted
&quot; a Mö@@ ch@@ te@@ at @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ atic , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Mus@@ lim@@ in . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a homo@@ sexual person , like some of my friends , but as Mus@@ lim@@ in . I chose to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head coverage . &quot;
&quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; Why do you sup@@ pressed yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the som@@ ber was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , namely against the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to suit me a perfect and un@@ touch@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not just accepted the faith of my parents .
I have moved with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , was in question , doub@@ ted and believed in the end . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the cor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to the wines .
I see myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; had you ever had the feeling that someone you perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understand , and yet somehow love ? &quot;
this is how it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineering . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; E@@ il@@ message . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flo@@ wed in buildings , people ran@@ kings from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into rebellion .
why should we do something like this ?
&quot; I switched to the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; Muslim desc@@ end@@ age &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ni@@ ast@@ ed descent &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; bom@@ bed Mecca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked my country but in the N@@ u , the deeds of others gathered me from a citizen into a suspi@@ cious . &quot;
the same day we had to drive through the Middle East in the USA to move to a new city and start up with the integration of studies .
&quot; I remember how I found myself -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as Mus@@ lim@@ in . &quot;
&quot; we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard that I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations , the said , &quot; &quot; are alert , &quot; &quot; lead in good lighted areas , &quot; &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ mm@@ elt not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
&quot; then , it was Friday that week -- the day in which Muslims gather for prayer . &quot;
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque might be a goal . &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims and people who held for Muslims , forced into the free place . &quot;
there were really fire@@ places on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
&quot; because the people , who had attacked this country , have attacked our country . &quot;
I have conquered the fur@@ y of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
these are the accus@@ ations which are hard .
nowadays we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is said Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only poses the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor one can only be under observation .
the alternatives are poin@@ tless because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer , and Olympi@@ oni@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of Mo@@ sche@@ en America safer to make ?
&quot; maybe there will be a few parking available , but not the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to the people of other faith tolerant , and to show greater citizens &apos; participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a director of the police in the Washington , D.C. recently told : people will actually not be radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they will be radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; the radic@@ alisation process has established that he begins online . as a result , the person is cut off by her church , even from her family , so that the person believes that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who desp@@ ises their behavior and ideology , is a tra@@ itor , or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to avoid radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still claiming that Islam is a non @-@ violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a person , as a person , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add ourselves to their imagination if one recognizes it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ club Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology reasons on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but when one casts a look at it , it is not driving them what they were in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she would prefer to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every man who had spoken to her , she brought to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given sense to their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alisation through extremis@@ ts who spoke to their solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m set the connection with God and her church again .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using it for their anger , he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they learned in the mosque , did it to close to the IS . &quot;
that was an insight that the Islam@@ ophobia is about me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day affects our democracy and our freedom of thoughts ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear that at least three things happen .
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian governmental system , conformity and prejudices . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals : if you report the people news in which negative about Muslims has been reported , they are rather than military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; when you look at when the mood against Muslims came up at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- it happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of Iraq war and during two choices .
so Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to make the foundation of a free society that has sensible and well informed citizens .
the handling of Muslims is an early warning .
&quot; we perhaps sense it as the first , but the toxic air is frightened to all of us . &quot;
in the assignment of collec@@ tiv@@ c@@ ence it is not just about being able to explain themselves .
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an athle@@ te .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , much promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me , that he was the sweet@@ est , gr@@ gi@@ est man was , whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is such a sealed young man from my frat@@ ernity ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she was murdered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who had arrived in the afternoon . he did it in their apartment , as with a execution , after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he was eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we think it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or someone in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove silent , with high pressure on the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , drew my shoes off , went into prayer sh@@ alle , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , printed and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , athe@@ ists , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to join us . &quot;
at that moment I broke down .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to make sure ?
or will you connect to those that mean : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia ; you seem to have taken a nerve .
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you &apos;re using a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a den@@ ker@@ k with deep underground work , i.e. an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you don &apos;t . I am absolutely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; looking at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever done study of Muslims around the world , people want ordinary things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people appear as an exception to the rule , then the rule is usually broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for cra@@ fting , is just before , to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for professional dr@@ ones . made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air par@@ c@@ itations to our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of aircraft engines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they started to fly with side@@ bars . &quot;
through inter@@ connecting air devices high speed and acceleration in the narro@@ west space .
you can also build self @-@ resili@@ ent structures .
they have learned to wear burden sharing with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; so that a system works autonomous , it must know collectively , where in the room the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ET@@ H Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on rapid development dynam@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , an all of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands are available in the highest image , e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter .
&quot; a flight , which tries to beat two flying with a cap . &quot;
&quot; like other starter regul@@ ator , it is efficient in advance @-@ moving efficiently , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ti@@ ppers , it can float , and therefore has great benefits in the start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
however there is always a downside .
a restriction of tail@@ light is that it is sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind arches .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft is not able to regain the optimum position and improved the performance by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often place fundamental abstract questions , which is at the heart of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be : what is the smaller number of common parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts that gather ment@@ un to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pilot controlled air @-@ controlled flight devices were flying , which had only two mobile parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate . &quot;
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical easiest @-@ controlled flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a pro@@ pane , &quot;
&quot; no lob@@ es , hing@@ es and cros@@ sc@@ ru@@ es , no further actu@@ ator or controllers , just a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , happens in the inside life very much so it can fly stable and can move around in the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to flies , I have to throw it exactly right . &quot;
&quot; the probability to throw it exactly properly , if all of me watch , is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ e@@ inner is an exercise in pleasure , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ants , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symm@@ etrical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; in this way , he will receive the proper ability , &quot;
moving in space to all directions - no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ated .
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ell@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; some is adjustable in models , the rest is learned directly at flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our daily life , they must be extremely secure and reliable . &quot;
this machine is composed of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers aircraft engines .
this turns in clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; if you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery - the machine can continue to fly , albeit constra@@ ined . &quot;
we will demonstrate that by making a half of the air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration studied synthetic s@@ warming .
&quot; large number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than a disk of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine da dr@@ ush would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types like us , the wage is in the development and the work of creation . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures , to shape it in so spectacular ways . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1,3 billion years ago cir@@ cl@@ ists in a very far distant Galaxy two black holes are getting closer each other getting faster , they walked as the mass of three suns in a tenth of a tenth of a stri@@ fe in pure energy . &quot;
this short moment shining bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not put them in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let &apos;s arrange the events first time .
about 1.3 billion years ago there was a multi @-@ cel@@ estial life on Earth .
&quot; since then , the earth brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , people and -- God present us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- R@@ ai Weiss of MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech - build a huge laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise by colon@@ ized black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
&quot; but enough people realized it as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation was funded by their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work they built the det@@ ector LIG@@ O : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent time , the precision of LIG@@ O could considerably increase what the recognition output was greatly improved . &quot;
that is why we call it Advanced LIG@@ O .
&quot; in early September 2015 , LIG@@ O was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes passed through the earth . &quot;
you went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell with my to@@ d@@ ill &apos;s father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
&quot; all this , what I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physic@@ ist at MIT . he studied since 23 years of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their through observ@@ atories such as LIG@@ O measurable signals ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cro@@ ws in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when passing the wave , the space and its total content will be stretched towards one direction and fold into the other . &quot;
&quot; for reflection , lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses for rel@@ ativity @-@ theory is often a really al@@ ber@@ ant dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sty , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridiculous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched out at the meeting of the waves and the stretching of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is called 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 Dar@@ um , you declared the LIG@@ O staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometers long laser det@@ ector , and this is absurd , this length should be measured in less than a thou@@ sand@@ ths of a nuclear plant . that &apos;s grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text on gravity
&quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are tremendous . &quot;
&quot; physic@@ ists are sin@@ ful , and with the support of the public , certainly all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
coming back to LIG@@ O . Scott maintains that LIG@@ O is more a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : visual elev@@ ators , the size of your cell phone . &quot;
this is quite convenient . for so you can customize an image or a map of things by taking the light from multiple points coming around you .
with notes is that different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that offer you particularly much : &quot;
the face of your child about .
&quot; instead we listen to certain properties like recording and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just speak Alice . &quot;
and Bob breaks them .
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can make no simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; however , considering changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least lie for LIG@@ O the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so , if we convert wave patterns into circuits , we can listen to the All literally . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the grav@@ itation , this can betra@@ y us much about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy very long . &quot;
&quot; S@@ H : two black , non @-@ revol@@ ving holes , circular pen simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
turning the two bodies very quickly and you hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional key change . that sounds like : Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu !
it is a sort of movement vocabulary into the wav@@ e@@ form .
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date , that at least I will never be forgotten -- I heard LIG@@ O following : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fat solar mass , which revol@@ ve about as fast as the rod of your mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : let us think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 son@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 son@@ es , revol@@ ve each one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces before .
fantastic .
&quot; and we know of it , because we have heard it . &quot;
therein lies the remaining importance of LIG@@ O .
LIG@@ O p@@ aves a completely new way to study the universe as it has never been possible before .
&quot; on this way , we can hear the space and hear the invisible . &quot;
much in space we can -- practical or basically - do not see .
&quot; a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ king stars in super @-@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the space .
&quot; however , the exciting physical processes occur however at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it would be more transparent glass . the Ur@@ b@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the jungle is covered by its own flas@@ hing glow . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and most importantly : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we will never see and of whom we don &apos;t have any idea , that we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LIG@@ O first found things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LIG@@ O project , says to this topic : Me : the kind of stars , the black holes , like LIG@@ O they are observed are the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient physique from prehistoric times . the black holes are called the Sau@@ ri@@ er@@ bones for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LIG@@ O offers us a completely different point of view on the events occurring in space , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to LIG@@ O , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the predat@@ ory and cir@@ cus of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
&quot; for what could be nic@@ er , than to listen to the jungle ? &quot;
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; for a year I would say to all &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; in front of which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; whether it was me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I be live on TV live ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I start playing with the swing ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly that before I feared to eliminate my fear .
&quot; my fear , talk to keep my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain yes , that my life was deeply changing , to an unexpected . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , called for un@@ explained reasons &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; estim@@ ation , I need milk for my beak @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once if I could play with her , when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; I swe@@ ar to a new attitude in my family . from there I swe@@ ar to always play with them once you call me up . no matter what I am doing , or wherever I go , I say always yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am trying too . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a astonishing side effect : first of short , I actually understood that the &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children my career saved . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am author@@ ess . I am thinking of things , we@@ ave to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ate television . I produced television .
&quot; I do TV , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for releasing 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; every broadcast offers hundreds of jobs , which previously did not exist . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a TV unit can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days times four shows , i.e. every nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , four hours TV , three broad@@ casts , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series are running on Thurs@@ days .
all over the world my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ lessly . I must find time , really sti@@ lle , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and to tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires , which are around the world . &quot;
do you know who this is still doing ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I would not like to impress you with it .
&quot; I say to it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; &quot; author &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I say to you so that all of you who are working so hard if you are now a company , a country or a household , take me serious when I speak of work , so you understand that I don &apos;t just talk around the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it is right when I say , I understand that at a dream job does not go to dreams . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all per@@ spir@@ ation -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I have deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a land from nothing .
&quot; it is , when I set troops on , as painted me on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; so when you get a high sound , one lie@@ der a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and in@@ toxic@@ ating , sound@@ ly and maternal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the buzz . &quot;
there is such a change in me if work is well running .
&quot; a buzz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the buzz sounds like a busy road , I could always drive on her . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I declare to them the sums that I am writing about writing , that writing me pleasure . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong you do it .
&quot; but the buzz -- when I started working with television production , when I began working and to work and work , build up and work together , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy . the buzz ! &quot;
the tot@@ als is more than writing .
the buzz is action and activity . the buzz is a drug .
the buzz is music . the buzz is light and air .
the buzz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a buzz , you cannot just strive for size . &quot;
&quot; feel no different to be able to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the buzz .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is called genius .
maybe it is said ego .
maybe it is the fear of the failure .
I do not know .
&quot; I know only that I am not for failure , and I just know that I love the buzz . &quot;
&quot; I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know I will not ask it to question . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more things the same , the more things are at the same time , the more observe me , the more I write history , all more expectations there . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
&quot; I love working , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the land , which I created , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the buzz . &quot;
I like this buzz . I love the buzz .
I need the buzz . I am the buzz .
am I only this sums ?
and then the buzz stops .
&quot; revised , over@@ claimed , exagger@@ ated , burned out . &quot;
the sums were stopped .
&quot; now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth , that their mother is a single work of the institute . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people , &quot; &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; judging , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
there are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums were recorded . &quot;
the buzz of the engine is pet@@ ted .
I did not love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my buzz was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , no repentance , nothing del@@ e@@ ability , a Titan sleeps , does not exist , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no buzz .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was an advertisement @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the buzz and the buzz I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly verb@@ ally ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you out , bl@@ us@@ out the author Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know , you are doing it , you are doing what you are doing a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love one another , and know how the buzz feels when you stopped the buzz , if the buzz stops , who is then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart listen , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then I put a question in my &quot; southern states &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress .
&quot; I am on the way out , late dran and she says , &quot; M@@ um , Do you play ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say No , when two things are aware of me : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not . &quot;
it is called no more &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
when is this happen ?
&quot; I betra@@ y it when I am Titan , and my buzz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; M@@ um , Do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; we play and see her sisters , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing unusual .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and the absence of the Sum@@ mon , I can &apos;t do anything except that . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the land , which I created , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists is sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ al@@ ps and the song in which it can leave behind , or whatever the girl in &quot; The king@@ gin &quot; can be released . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me is sol@@ ves .
a mental door is going on and a energy panel comes in .
&quot; and that not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the buzz is slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the buzz , but a buzz . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no secret . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the working environment , the Titan@@ ium transm@@ itter , this is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe me using ship@@ ments and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real buzz is . &quot;
the sums is not a force and it is not working @-@ specific .
it is dependent on joy .
the real buzz is dependent on love .
the buzz is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
the real buzz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real buzz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the reli@@ ed tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real buzz is simple and original .
&quot; the real buzz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe God whis@@ pered me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child will play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so I can rid myself as work@@ a@@ holic of any fault . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the buzz again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; playing is not as easy to play , how to work . &quot;
&quot; the truth is hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I am rather at home at home .
&quot; this entrance is painful , because what a human being is working rather than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we spe@@ en in the garden around , ahead and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we do small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we sm@@ as@@ hing soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel predominantly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always use after my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ c .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the buzz of the universe filled me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped with the games ?
you can also make it ! tell you always yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day @-@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; there you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they einf@@ alls that they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes I replaces a Mari@@ enk@@ ins or K@@ eks .
&quot; and speak my teenage daughter all 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not . &quot;
&quot; everyone can bring 15 minutes a bit , even at a bad mood ! &quot;
15 minutes a bit !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
the day is short : dinner that make children extra bed .
but 15 minutes are in store !
&quot; my children are my wellbeing , my world . you don &apos;t have to be the children . it is true to feel the buzz of a place for his soul peace . &quot;
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about joy
to play &quot; games &quot; in general .
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out it and keep it yourself .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I sh@@ eit@@ ers and I si@@ ege . friends meet books to enjoy the day --
want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in education when I wanted to exc@@ el myself more and more .
15 minutes on the piece why not treat yourself every 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong in it ? nothing !
the sums come back in my spare time . the buzz seems to return if I do not work .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months opens a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear a UFO melody , she fills me and my soul . she re@@ direc@@ ts me to new ideas . I use it in full gul@@ ps and love my job again . &quot;
&quot; I like the buzz , but I do not love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
&quot; I am not the sums , the money is not I ... not anymore . &quot;
soap blowing and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my buzz .
the buzz of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the buzz of work is part of me , but just a part of it . and that is why I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is me that I am a Titan Poker . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire are still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the buzz . the country I reach the marathon , the marathon , the troops , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the buzz : the buzz of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel the buzz , the more this unusual , cruel , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author@@ ess . I am thinking of things , I we@@ ep you to life . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the job , that means to live its dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to play more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am a neurolog@@ ist .
as most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke , or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon is it very frustrating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very low ability of self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have an abi@@ ding , heavy disability . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I have functional neuro@@ surgery in surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through different surgical measures .
&quot; sure , they have heard of one of the most prominent , the &quot; &quot; woo@@ p @-@ stimulation &quot; . &quot; in doing so , you have an electro@@ de deep in the brain to affect the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neurological function improves . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kinson which suffered under severe tre@@ mb@@ ling and heavy pain .
&quot; Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
&quot; at the time , I was a leader and working day and night in the notation . &quot;
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma .
you need to imagine that at skull @-@ deer @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a the brain floating and the skull of the skull increases .
&quot; to save life , you have to dimin@@ ish the skull of the skull . &quot;
it is sometimes necessary to remove a part of the brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing the bra@@ ined brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to be able to grow cells from a tissue piece , is comparable with quite small children that can be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts he managed Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
maybe you know from the bi@@ ology lessons that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform into any cellular type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of brain mass in the surgery .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells tend to be different .
they slowly spread out slowly and after a few weeks she even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but turned out differently . &quot;
&quot; we needed long to understand , where they came . &quot;
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells called hot Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our grand@@ master @-@ bo@@ wel cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of fet@@ us they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay to us ?
we do not know that .
we believe they take part in the healing of the brain because we find it near brain injury to higher concentrations .
but this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain @-@ healing .
we had to prove that .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experiment . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area , and then to cultivate the cells as it Jean @-@ François &quot;
and they are subsequently colored to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we returned to the recording of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ otran@@ sm@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we reproduce these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reproduce the same cells into obli@@ ging brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , they go back home . the room is already occupied , so they will not disappear , so disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we added a violation and re@@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you can see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
&quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells , which we were in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
here we were not able to stop .
are these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
&quot; so , we tra@@ ded monkeys with a manual skill task . &quot;
you had to take feed pel@@ lets from a tra@@ y .
they made them very well .
&quot; as they achieved a stable skill level , we last in the motor cor@@ tex the hand@@ hel@@ per area . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in people , they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plas@@ tic bra@@ in@@ ism . they recover a certain degree , just as with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; as we were sure the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side they see the monkey , which recovered spontaneously . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
he is not so accurate and not so fast .
&quot; now you see , when we reproduce the cells , the same monkey , two months after the im@@ plantation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting outcomes for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example for Par@@ kinson . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ itate her in humans .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I will definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at human . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and try to get permission to start clinical studies . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can get into hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : it is difficult to say .
&quot; first , it depends on approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will it allow us to launch the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it needs a long time to select patients select the treatments and evaluate whether it &apos;s useful to do this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
&quot; first , one has to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : natural . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
&quot; we in the West make a big mistake , as of course to look at . &quot;
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as the inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing danger .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have doub@@ tless proven that it is definitely possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely non @-@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy over@@ comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ ambiguous to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not likely to influence the austerity programmes that were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my Ascen@@ ded friends , told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if they change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you to believe in common with me , that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defen@@ cel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy our societies are painted , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of wast@@ age , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which is currently threatened by our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin summit paradox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , which thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognise the debt mountain , &quot;
but only a few recognize his twin @-@ type .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the assets and corporations , which , however , are too anxious to invest in where it would be productive and income which could urgently take part in the debt crisis and also need to produce all the things that humanity urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars were invested in the US , in England and in the euro area , in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , gases , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sound after a lot of money until you compar@@ es it with 5.2 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions and absolutely nothing but the stock exchanges to mo@@ wers and real estate prices .
&quot; such a debt and un@@ productive capital make the twin summit , which are not the same through the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is st@@ agn@@ ant wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , like oil , the prophecy of O@@ ra@@ k@@ el could become true that his son would kill him if he will grow , &quot;
un@@ question@@ ing the circumstances leading to that oil is k@@ ills it .
that is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely wasted kind of art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth . &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
I believe . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to make the status of ath@@ ic democracy due to these degrees . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it was involved in the working arms , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but important and crucial that she grants them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal mood in questions of the government . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not held a long time --
&quot; like a candle , which glo@@ ws very bright , she is also quickly burned . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal democracies did not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process has been imposed on policy , while the economy -- and the world of corporations -- a democratic free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our democracies , democracies has been held since the time when this separation of politics and business began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two by the economy gradually emigr@@ ated and depri@@ ved them . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer like this before ?
it is not up to a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because it is possible to be in the government today and still not in power , because the power of politics is im@@ migr@@ ated to the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ des with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it is about such as a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , who are so sustainable the animals , of which they nour@@ ishes , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are at the end therefore star@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that the politics is so far beyond the self @-@ causing economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations grows , political goods increases , the economic demand rises , the overall economic demand and the managing director of the corporations are too sc@@ ared to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; exp@@ elled from democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and of the wealth of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we have to bring about politics and the economy and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; control the control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea about 100 years ago and it was not very good .
&quot; the teaching from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain a position as in the ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance . &quot;
but there is one solution : to create the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ vals through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is that long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation of the twin summit will be higher , the wast@@ age and social conflicts are deeper , as I think -- as soon as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we need to re @-@ create the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and in doing so , we take care of the re@@ united area , otherwise we will be able to appear in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that leaves the film &quot; matrix &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
so the question is not whether capitalism has brought up the technical achievements that he has brought out .
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; in which machines serve the people and the people put their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we may be optimistic .
&quot; so what do it look , how could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation I would like to call you , in a nut@@ shell , a few examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies , please ask a capital market in which you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
then all incomes come from capital and from fatigue and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but no exchange between capital and labour , no major gaps between capital and austerity , and ultimately no up@@ ra@@ ging twin summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely wa@@ vering exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; . &quot;
&quot; continue to face that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the deficit of commercial deficit or the commercial net income of the country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are scarce . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in Br@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one was not the technical means to realise it .
&quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world which I describe is at the same time liber@@ ating , in which they fav@@ ored privileged people , and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and labor in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ically , global key@@ chains . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or are we in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ed ?
the answer depends on how we can decide politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic . &quot;
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anyone of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... we do not do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in overall economic demand that Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mer@@ it is called &quot; long @-@ term stagnation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transmission of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only destabili@@ ze our democracies , but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ ary Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and this is why I am absolutely comfor@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; BG : in fact , and now we are at ease . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ ling , you do not think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you think from the perspective of the West in China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracies we have the semb@@ lance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics while the area where most of the economy is playing , -- the area of economy -- a totally democratic free zone . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles today the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; because -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was very skep@@ tical regarding the democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed now in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; today , China is now proposing to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century itself , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many list@@ ener are curious about your experiences as the Greek finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to say goodbye to self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the continuous denial made that massive distor@@ tion of the euro zone ran and continues to massi@@ vely threaten the development of the whole of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal was that this denial revealed . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the forces within the euro zone , within the European group , continue to be elected . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try a business system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism into life , one may perhaps delay a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what change do you see in advance ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its layout .
BG : did you make any mistakes made in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriousness ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or anyone who exists after 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , claims , he did not make any mistakes , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake had to sign the request for renewal of the end of February at the end of February .
&quot; I believed that there was an honest interest in the don@@ or , a common solution . &quot;
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government to the case only because they did not want to deal with the enforcement of the euro zone .
they did not want to confess that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; that &apos;s worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot;
&quot; none from the Troika of the don@@ ors who imposed on us this policy , stressed : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive table of talks , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the shared tile forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be disastrous for Europe alone , but for the world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we surrender ourselves to the path of a post@@ modern 1930 what it appears to me , it will be equally well toler@@ ated for the future of Europeans and the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you very much , that you were at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; by Roy Price , most of them have never heard , though he probably is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for so many of you . &quot;
that &apos;s going back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leader at Amazon Studios
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an iter@@ acy and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for making the shows and the content of the Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series you can &apos;t choose any one .
&quot; he must find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve . &quot;
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this evaluation .
&quot; if your show is rated at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ one , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , addic@@ tive , where , after having looked at a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ ler and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what goes on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think that you already have special intelligence to offer &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ ler and Ti@@ aras &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the average yield , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they are simply not enth@@ r@@ alled . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon does something , that &apos;s why Roy Price is nothing to risk . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and choose eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online where they can look at each other free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon gives out a lot of things , one does not attack properly ? &quot;
millions of viewers look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they will be observed at the look of these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who will record everything .
&quot; you can grasp how to start the show when you are pressing , which parts you ski@@ ps and look again . &quot;
&quot; they collect millions of data , in order to decide on these data which show them should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com via four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many will remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lan@@ ced at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time with another company , another manager placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it but he makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a competition , he and his team saw the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they show the shows , their course , what shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which actors , what actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com of four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; house of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what is happening here ? &quot;
&quot; it has two very powerful peti@@ tive , data irreversible companies . &quot;
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data for a decision which one meets , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized with very powerful computers .
&quot; what you can expect is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so , then this is a bit scary because we are living in a time where we can take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does someone know the company multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; nobody . OK , this is even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into touch with this software . come in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison here and ask for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ mis@@ sal is made or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; mid @-@ sized TV , 22 minutes , this can be real bad but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results generated . this is not the fact that a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the dates of the most rep@@ uted companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; 2009 , Google announced that they can pre@@ dict data analysis kinds of flu , the terrible kind , pre@@ dict -- by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked flaw@@ lessly , year round year until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data irreversible companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors flows into decisions of life - at work , in the workplace , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for anti @-@ cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a medicine . over the years I recognized several samples of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , just do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , put this problem in its parts , so you can analyze the items ; as a result , you put the parts again together to write a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; when there is something that the brain is good , it is possible to add parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision - especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful , because they have used data and minds where they belong to the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , why they would otherwise have been able to do better . but the decision , how to put all these parts again , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; which was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their choices , first as they are called for TV ideas , then as she chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and not to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ issue , you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- just here at this moment . &quot;
I will discuss it later with a technology demo .
&quot; so far I met some decisions in my life , while I should hear in retrosp@@ ect on the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them by something much more cl@@ oned , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; perhaps the ball becomes wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news , that despite the large amount of data still pays out , decisions to be an expert in what you do , and risk . &quot;
&quot; in the end it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks beautiful .
