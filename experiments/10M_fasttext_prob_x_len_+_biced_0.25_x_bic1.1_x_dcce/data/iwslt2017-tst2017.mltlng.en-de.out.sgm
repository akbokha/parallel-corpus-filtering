<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They perhaps know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone of Edward Snowden had heard, Risen wrote a book in which it was spectacular, that the NSA heard illegal phones from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, where the CIA has literally been drafts for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the crazy sounds, you can read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not fall at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for nearly 10 years, the government has chosen against Risen and called it to name its alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol for the pattern of government, whistleblowers to condemn and escalate journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right, if media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of those who they would like."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so as the government of Risen anchors, he did something that many courageous reporters already did before him, he refused and said that he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they were for years that it would be indispensable for their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can still hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of having to fail and bring forth Risen statements, that could do its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without its consent, his phone call is secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its loan agreement, and even rice-wise with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to denounce Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistle-whistle and Risks supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect against his attack, whistleblowers to protect. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a whistle-blower that went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we set the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional bodies, because the government has more and more possibilities to pronounce all of them."</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, just like technology of the government allowed the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"while they can do that from the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today, there are communication software that has not yet been written when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than regular e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transfer system for whistleblowers who was originally developed from the internet-famous, which by us received Aaron Swartz, has been developed and today was developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents uploading or send information, just as in any common contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these will be encrypted and stored on a server, where only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot collect more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that are all endanger us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is up to us to ensure that not only technology denominator like Edward Snowden have a way to put iniquity. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"the information about disappearances in the supply of soldiers is humble and he wants to report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental laborers, which suggests alarm to contaminated water from Flint. or a pilgrimage insider that warned us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the biggest Datleck of History was released.] [the" "Panama Papers" "revealed that friction and powerful] have hidden in tax havens.] [what does that mean?] we were sourced by news about a leck of 11 million documents of the estate law firm in Panama in Panama.]"</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca go and say," okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works, how it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad Briefkastenames has in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it claims that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin performs, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous about the next release, and to the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">"well, it sounds like the Plot of an agency's name or a John-Grisham-novel."</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address what?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is, if the rich and powerful is able to hide their assets in tax havens and do not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Ward, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"the whole world will discuss media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens to hide from a few times to hide their assets and wear it -- something that we have been discussing and revealing it for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people appear this whole world very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens function."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always place it like a Matrjoschkapsel.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a firm in another company, in another company, in another company that makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably, because there were no prominent Americans in this revelations, that scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle, after which these tax havens function, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a database of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is that you need less information in some US-states to provide less information to establish a company than to obtain a librarian."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparent in the US has allowed employees from school districts to pick school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed to scams especially tense investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Ward we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent a covered investigator in the offices of 13 lawyers companies in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator was born as an African Minister, who wanted to bring money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we truly pointed out that all up to a lawyer of our investigator proposals made proposals, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all predictations. none of these lawyers participated us as clients, and of course, no one was handed over to it, but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our deceived investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single market policy, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very dreamy, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing has ever been altered, as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"however, as a born optimist, I see that some changes have begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen more transparency towards more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the topic took place political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has captured central registers at the national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Ward this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlines."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy, who stand up and say:" Intransparent is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and campaigning for it, to end laws these kinds of transparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finally terminate the intransparent that allows us to finish this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazdas."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard resale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city, and just made a roadtrip all the country. after that, he would go to the peaccorps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where sleeps you tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse:" "I do not know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who knows the situation not?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to land in the trunk of a mazest!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," äh, as please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was in bed, I was sitting at the ceiling and thought:" Oh dear! what did I get into it? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild sea sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, shut up on toe nails, and my sleeping room door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork that he had bought from me today in his classroom, he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered."</seg>
<seg id="122">"people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"do we make a jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates withdraw from and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I survived how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk inclusive, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We asked a website and set so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors with us for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure about our cheeses of ham and melted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we had passed the last guest, and the door to the castle fell, rocking Brian and I am approaching."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to the reels.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make this a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented to investors:" "we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms, their doors, whose doors are closed if you visit."</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite the wild people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"act, however, it is not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still very consolation, would invest in a business that allowed strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, one feels on the things you can get good. we could designate."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to designate objects but now we wanted to create trust through design and trust, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a difference?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a precious sample, which degree we give confidence."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlockout mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this silent approach of panic, you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the conceal cell of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of them feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most of the guests feel when they stay elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"only so, who now has Al Gorit's cell phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce to Twitter that he is canalded to the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now reset your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour would only be presented with his name: if he had told, whence he comes, how his dog or his children would be called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine, you would have 150 assessments that are all saying:" "he really can hold very well depressed phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">For a well-designed feedback system strengthens the confidence crucial.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to prevent negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their ratings before we created them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined, how most likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are about age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Very surprising we trust the people most who are most like.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social lecture.</seg>
<seg id="181">Thrilling will add it when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by Beurals.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three ratings does not change.</seg>
<seg id="183">"but, one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get off."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little about how" "hi!" "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"tell too much, like for example:" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is also not accepted. "</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." Tolle artworks in your home! I do my family vacation. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics one should write some.</seg>
<seg id="193">"our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help, overcome our prejudices against foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we had not reckoned, was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, I am incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"third: a need, which had not been covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have dwelled dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">"at the beginning of the project, I have been working in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing bad than these calls. it already hurts if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment, which you hear in the voice of the attack, was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, the 123 million left nights had only a fraction of the problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trust each other right.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, it can be wonderful."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host took him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donates blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, who tend to be cohabitual due to sitting activities."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra, Javier and Alejandra are real protector that can save life even though they do not know a real thing."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you go to hospital in your own car when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you feel lonely and they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without charge the extra-night stay.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course not every stay will run away.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind pure money transfer are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about economic commerce.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now just a" "rent industry", "the thing will not do justice."</seg>
<seg id="228">"Share Economy describes a trade, the human relationship promises."</seg>
<seg id="229">"humans put a part of himself open, and that changes all."</seg>
<seg id="230">"if you travel nowadays, this is fast to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"what would, however, if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place you visited, a group of Answer would wait to refill a thoroughly and to show a pub in a pub that has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cook cooking of a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">These days are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to design apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have to take the thought of a common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships, instead of loneliness and depreciation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the Government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"now, the inhabitants were offered. students who were looking for a lead,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"to convey to people whose children were moved. there were Incubator programs,"</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new Start-ups in the Share Economy. about our platform alone will be 785 000 people in 191 countries guest at a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">"hospitality, there was also before."</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find the amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I need to think about it when a red Mazda goes over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We of course know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brain-washing, a terrorist militia?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">This is how the media represent people look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think the most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met a Moslems, It is great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">"a Möchteat-Fitness-fanatic,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslimin."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as Muslimin. I chose to wear the Hijab, my head coverage."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified," Why do you suppressed yourself? "</seg>
<seg id="278">"the somber was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, namely against the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old, to suit me a perfect and untouchable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not just accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have moved with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, was in question, doubted and believed in the end."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the corans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to the wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I see myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"had you ever had the feeling that someone you perceives you fully understand, and yet somehow love?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" "Egyptian-American dream". ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I was sitting in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" Eilmessage. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flowed in buildings, people rankings from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do something like this?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the television channel and heard:" "Muslim terrorists"... "..." "Muslim descendage"... "..." "niasted descent"... "..." "bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked my country but in the Nu, the deeds of others gathered me from a citizen into a suspicious."</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the Middle East in the USA to move to a new city and start up with the integration of studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I found myself -- so deep it went into my seat, and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslimin."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard that I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations, the said," "are alert," "lead in good lighted areas," "Versammmelt not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then, it was Friday that week -- the day in which Muslims gather for prayer."</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" do not go on this first Friday, the mosque might be a goal. "</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims and people who held for Muslims, forced into the free place."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fireplaces on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because the people, who had attacked this country, have attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I have conquered the fury of the people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations which are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is said Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only poses the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour as a whole and a benign tumor one can only be under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthelfer, and Olympionians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Moscheen America safer to make?</seg>
<seg id="331">"maybe there will be a few parking available, but not the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to the people of other faith tolerant, and to show greater citizens' participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a director of the police in the Washington, D.C. recently told: people will actually not be radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They will be radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"the radicalisation process has established that he begins online. as a result, the person is cut off by her church, even from her family, so that the person believes that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who despises their behavior and ideology, is a traitor, or of faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to avoid radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a non-violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a person, as a person, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to their imagination if one recognizes it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-club Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when one casts a look at it, it is not driving them what they were in their" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she would prefer to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every man who had spoken to her, she brought to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given sense to their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalisation through extremists who spoke to their solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam set the connection with God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing it for their anger, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what they learned in the mosque, did it to close to the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight that the Islamophobia is about me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day affects our democracy and our freedom of thoughts?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear that at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian governmental system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study reveals: if you report the people news in which negative about Muslims has been reported, they are rather than military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you look at when the mood against Muslims came up at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- it happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of Iraq war and during two choices.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to make the foundation of a free society that has sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we perhaps sense it as the first, but the toxic air is frightened to all of us."</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collectivcence it is not just about being able to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental faculty, talented, much promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me, that he was the sweetest, grgiest man was, whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a sealed young man from my fraternity?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan who had arrived in the afternoon. he did it in their apartment, as with a execution, after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He was eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we think it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or someone in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we drove silent, with high pressure on the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, drew my shoes off, went into prayer shalle, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, printed and welcomed our guests, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I broke down.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to make sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those that mean: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia; you seem to have taken a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">"but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you're using a TEDTalk, a denkerk with deep underground work, i.e. an exception and not the rule."</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say that you don't. I am absolutely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am not an exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">"looking at Muslims around the world, and I did that with the greatest ever done study of Muslims around the world, people want ordinary things."</seg>
<seg id="403">"they want prosperity for the family, they want to work and they want to live in peace."</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">"if people appear as an exception to the rule, then the rule is usually broken and they are not the exception to the rule."</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">"what began as a platform for crafting, is just before, to become a billionaire business."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for professional drones. made possible in research institutions worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air parcitations to our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of aircraft engines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they started to fly with sidebars."</seg>
<seg id="410">Through interconnecting air devices high speed and acceleration in the narrowest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to wear burden sharing with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"so that a system works autonomous, it must know collectively, where in the room the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on rapid development dynamically."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, an all of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available in the highest image, e. g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter.</seg>
<seg id="422">"a flight, which tries to beat two flying with a cap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starter regulator, it is efficient in advance-moving efficiently, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most startippers, it can float, and therefore has great benefits in the start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of taillight is that it is sensitive to turbulence like wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft is not able to regain the optimum position and improved the performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often place fundamental abstract questions, which is at the heart of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smaller number of common parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts that gather mentun to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilot controlled air-controlled flight devices were flying, which had only two mobile parts: a propeller and a tailgate."</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospinner, the mechanical easiest-controlled flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propane,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no lobes, hinges and crosscrues, no further actuator or controllers, just a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, happens in the inside life very much so it can fly stable and can move around in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to flies, I have to throw it exactly right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability to throw it exactly properly, if all of me watch, is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the moneinner is an exercise in pleasure, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellants, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"in this way, he will receive the proper ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space to all directions - no matter what direction it is rotated or even as it rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellants."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is adjustable in models, the rest is learned directly at flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our daily life, they must be extremely secure and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate two-propellers aircraft engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"if you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery - the machine can continue to fly, albeit constrained."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by making a half of the airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration studied synthetic swarming.</seg>
<seg id="459">"large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than a disk of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine da drush would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">"for types like us, the wage is in the development and the work of creation."</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures, to shape it in so spectacular ways."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1,3 billion years ago circlists in a very far distant Galaxy two black holes are getting closer each other getting faster, they walked as the mass of three suns in a tenth of a tenth of a strife in pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment shining brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not put them in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let's arrange the events first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">About 1.3 billion years ago there was a multi-celestial life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the earth brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God present us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss of MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech - build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which arise by colonized black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people realized it as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation was funded by their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser-interferometer - gravitational-waves."</seg>
<seg id="482">"during the subsequent time, the precision of LIGO could considerably increase what the recognition output was greatly improved."</seg>
<seg id="483">That is why we call it Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in early September 2015, LIGO was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes passed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">You went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell with my todill's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"all this, what I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he studied since 23 years of gravitational-waves from black holes and their through observatories such as LIGO measurable signals?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crows in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the wave, the space and its total content will be stretched towards one direction and fold into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for reflection, lecturers in courses for relativity-theory is often a really alberant dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusty, stretching and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched out at the meeting of the waves and the stretching of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is called 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1 Darum, you declared the LIGO staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometers long laser detector, and this is absurd, this length should be measured in less than a thousandths of a nuclear plant. that's grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"described Kip Thorne, a co-founder Ligos, the hunt for the waves:" the technical difficulties when building such detectors are tremendous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"physicists are sinful, and with the support of the public, certainly all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Coming back to LIGO. Scott maintains that LIGO is more a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: visual elevators, the size of your cell phone."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient. for so you can customize an image or a map of things by taking the light from multiple points coming around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With notes is that different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that offer you particularly much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child about.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain properties like recording and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just speak Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">And Bob breaks them.</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can make no simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"however, considering changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so, if we convert wave patterns into circuits, we can listen to the All literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"to listen to the gravitation, this can betray us much about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy very long."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-revolving holes, circular pen simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly and you hear the same circus with an additional key change. that sounds like: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a sort of movement vocabulary into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date, that at least I will never be forgotten -- I heard LIGO following:... two black holes with each 30-fat solar mass, which revolve about as fast as the rod of your mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 sones, the other with a mass of 36 sones, revolve each one hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">"and we know of it, because we have heard it."</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO paves a completely new way to study the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">"on this way, we can hear the space and hear the invisible."</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practical or basically - do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a super-nova, for example. I would like to know why masking stars in super-novae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the space.</seg>
<seg id="538">"however, the exciting physical processes occur however at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would be more transparent glass. the Urbang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the jungle is covered by its own flashing glow."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and most importantly: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we will never see and of whom we don't have any idea, that we can only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO first found things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: Me: the kind of stars, the black holes, like LIGO they are observed are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient physique from prehistoric times. the black holes are called the Saurierbones for our archeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO offers us a completely different point of view on the events occurring in space, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the predatory and circus of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">"for what could be nicer, than to listen to the jungle?"</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"for a year I would say to all" "Yes!" "in front of which I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="556">"whether it was me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say" "yes". ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I be live on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Would I start playing with the swing?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly that before I feared to eliminate my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, talk to keep my social fear -- Puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes, that my life was deeply changing, to an unexpected. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, called for unexplained reasons"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimation, I need milk for my beak-up."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me once if I could play with her, when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"I swear to a new attitude in my family. from there I swear to always play with them once you call me up. no matter what I am doing, or wherever I go, I say always yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am trying too."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has a astonishing side effect: first of short, I actually understood that the" "yes" "to play with my children my career saved."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am authoress. I am thinking of things, weave to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Create television. I produced television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I do TV, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for releasing 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">"every broadcast offers hundreds of jobs, which previously did not exist."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV unit can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days times four shows, i.e. every nine days 20 million dollar television, four TV programs, four hours TV, three broadcasts, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are running on Thursdays.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so still obendlessly. I must find time, really stille, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and to tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires, which are around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who this is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say to it, because I know what you think, when the word" "author". ""</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say to you so that all of you who are working so hard if you are now a company, a country or a household, take me serious when I speak of work, so you understand that I don't just talk around the computer and imaginative, and it is right when I say, I understand that at a dream job does not go to dreams."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all perspiration -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work much, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I have deepened in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set troops on, as painted me on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"so when you get a high sound, one lieder a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, tiring and intoxicating, funny and intoxicating, soundly and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me if work is well running.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could always drive on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I declare to them the sums that I am writing about writing, that writing me pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong you do it.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buzz -- when I started working with television production, when I began working and to work and work, build up and work together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the buzz!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The totals is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzz, you cannot just strive for size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feel no different to be able to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is said ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of the failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not for failure, and I just know that I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know I will not ask it to question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make it clear: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more things the same, the more things are at the same time, the more observe me, the more I write history, all more expectations there."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to succeed, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love working, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land, which I created, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stops.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overclaimed, exaggerated, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums were stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that their mother is a single work of the institute."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people," "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" judging, I want to go to Shonda-Land. "</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums were recorded."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine is petted.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, no repentance, nothing deleability, a Titan sleeps, does not exist, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was an advertisement-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly verbally?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "Heul you out, blusout the author Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know, you are doing it, you are doing what you are doing a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love one another, and know how the buzz feels when you stopped the buzz, if the buzz stops, who is then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart listen, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then I put a question in my "southern states" waitress.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late dran and she says," Mum, Do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say No, when two things are aware of me: "</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not."</seg>
<seg id="675">It is called no more "estimation." "</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I betray it when I am Titan, and my buzz, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mum, Do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and see her sisters, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops "." "</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing unusual.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and the absence of the Summon, I can't do anything except that."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land, which I created, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists is sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, waalps and the song in which it can leave behind, or whatever the girl in" The kinggin "can be released."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door is going on and a energy panel comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is silent, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the buzz, but a buzz."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No secret. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working environment, the Titanium transmitter, this is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe me using shipments and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not a force and it is not working-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the stream that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the relied tasks, anticipation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but maybe God whispered me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child will play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so I can rid myself as workaholic of any fault."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice unless I want to hear the buzz again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"playing is not as easy to play, how to work."</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth is hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I am rather at home at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this entrance is painful, because what a human being is working rather than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we speen in the garden around, ahead and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we do small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We smashing soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel predominantly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.c.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the buzz of the universe filled me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also make it! tell you always yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you hold me for naïve, for a day-dreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"there you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me, until they einfalls that they want to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"there are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes I replaces a Marienkins or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teenage daughter all 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more needs it not."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can bring 15 minutes a bit, even at a bad mood!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a bit!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner that make children extra bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in store!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my wellbeing, my world. you don't have to be the children. it is true to feel the buzz of a place for his soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children. it is about joy</seg>
<seg id="759">To play "games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and keep it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I sheiters and I siege. friends meet books to enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">Want to play? "is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in education when I wanted to excel myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece why not treat yourself every 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong in it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums come back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months opens a door, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear a UFO melody, she fills me and my soul. she redirects me to new ideas. I use it in full gulps and love my job again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I do not love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sums, the money is not I... not anymore."</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap blowing and sticky fingers, dinner with friends. "</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the buzz of work is part of me, but just a part of it. and that is why I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is me that I am a Titan Poker. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clear is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the country I reach the marathon, the marathon, the troops, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the buzz: the buzz of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel the buzz, the more this unusual, cruel, naked and new feeling of life in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am authoress. I am thinking of things, I weep you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, that means to live its dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurologist.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke, or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon is it very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low ability of self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have an abiding, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I have functional neurosurgery in surgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through different surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"sure, they have heard of one of the most prominent, the" "woop-stimulation". "in doing so, you have an electrode deep in the brain to affect the circuits of the neurons so that the neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson which suffered under severe trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"Neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">"at the time, I was a leader and working day and night in the notation."</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-Hirn-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You need to imagine that at skull-deer-traumata the brain floating and the skull of the skull increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you have to diminish the skull of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">It is sometimes necessary to remove a part of the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the brained brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to be able to grow cells from a tissue piece, is comparable with quite small children that can be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts he managed Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you know from the biology lessons that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform into any cellular type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells tend to be different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly spread out slowly and after a few weeks she even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but turned out differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed long to understand, where they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our grandmaster-bowel cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of fetus they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe they take part in the healing of the brain because we find it near brain injury to higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain-healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area, and then to cultivate the cells as it Jean-François"</seg>
<seg id="853">And they are subsequently colored to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we returned to the recording of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransmtation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reproduce these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reproduce the same cells into obliging brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely, they go back home. the room is already occupied, so they will not disappear, so disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we added a violation and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells, which we were in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we were not able to stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Are these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we traded monkeys with a manual skill task."</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"as they achieved a stable skill level, we last in the motor cortex the handhelper area."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in people, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just as after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brainism. they recover a certain degree, just as with the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"as we were sure the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left side they see the monkey, which recovered spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now you see, when we reproduce the cells, the same monkey, two months after the implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting outcomes for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use it in other neuropathological models, for example for Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate her in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I will definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at human."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and try to get permission to start clinical studies. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can get into hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to launch the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it needs a long time to select patients select the treatments and evaluate whether it's useful to do this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply it to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, one has to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone."</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">"we in the West make a big mistake, as of course to look at."</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as the inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging danger.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have doubtless proven that it is definitely possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely non-democratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy overcomes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unambiguous to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not likely to influence the austerity programmes that were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my Ascended friends, told me that democracy would be abolished if they change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe in common with me, that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenceless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy our societies are painted, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of wastage, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which is currently threatened by our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognise the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twin-type.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the assets and corporations, which, however, are too anxious to invest in where it would be productive and income which could urgently take part in the debt crisis and also need to produce all the things that humanity urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in the US, in England and in the euro area, in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, gases, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sound after a lot of money until you compares it with 5.2 trillion US dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions and absolutely nothing but the stock exchanges to mowers and real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">"such a debt and unproductive capital make the twin summit, which are not the same through the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnant wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54 year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, like oil, the prophecy of Orakel could become true that his son would kill him if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unquestioning the circumstances leading to that oil is kills it.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely wasted kind of art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to make the status of athic democracy due to these degrees."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor of the Athenian democracy was and is that it was involved in the working arms, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but important and crucial that she grants them the right to political co-determination with equal mood in questions of the government."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not held a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which glows very bright, she is also quickly burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our current liberal democracies did not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy was concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process has been imposed on policy, while the economy -- and the world of corporations -- a democratic free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our democracies, democracies has been held since the time when this separation of politics and business began, a relentless struggle between the two by the economy gradually emigrated and deprived them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer like this before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not up to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because it is possible to be in the government today and still not in power, because the power of politics is immigrated to the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hades with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it is about such as a herd of carnivores, who are so sustainable the animals, of which they nourishes, decimated that they are at the end therefore starving."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that the politics is so far beyond the self-causing economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations grows, political goods increases, the economic demand rises, the overall economic demand and the managing director of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism the" Demos "[the people] expelled from democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and of the wealth of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that's true, it is obvious that we have to bring about politics and the economy and it would be better if the" Demos "control the control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea about 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain a position as in the ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and extravagance."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to create the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing Niedrivals through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is that long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation of the twin summit will be higher, the wastage and social conflicts are deeper, as I think -- as soon as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we need to re-create the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and in doing so, we take care of the reunited area, otherwise we will be able to appear in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that leaves the film" matrix "as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism has brought up the technical achievements that he has brought out.</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to a dystopia, similar to the" "matrix", "in which machines serve the people and the people put their energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora, "in long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what do it look, how could it look like this" star Trek "-like utopia rather than the" matrix "-similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation I would like to call you, in a nutshell, a few examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies, please ask a capital market in which you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all incomes come from capital and from fatigue and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but no exchange between capital and labour, no major gaps between capital and austerity, and ultimately no upraging twin summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely wavering exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G20 [Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets]."</seg>
<seg id="966">"continue to face that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- call it" the cosmos, "in units of" cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the deficit of commercial deficit or the commercial net income of the country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are scarce."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in Brton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one was not the technical means to realise it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have them, especially against the background of a united politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world which I describe is at the same time liberating, in which they favored privileged people, and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and labor in the dustbin of history, and keynesianically, global keychains."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we in a "matrix" - similar dystoped?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we can decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratic."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as a libertarian Marxist.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if anyone of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and the economy is... we do not do that, technological development will produce such a massive decline in overall economic demand that Larry Summerit is called" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transmission of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as Hayek, therefore I am a libertary Marxist, and like Keynes, and this is why I am absolutely comforting."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: in fact, and now we are at ease."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you are not wirling, you do not think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have said very clearly what you think from the perspective of the West in China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics while the area where most of the economy is playing, -- the area of economy -- a totally democratic free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some respects, if I may say that provocative, China resembles today the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"because -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill -- "</seg>
<seg id="997">He was very skeptical regarding the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed now in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"today, China is now proposing to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century itself, smells of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listener are curious about your experiences as the Greek finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to say goodbye to self-sufficiency, and the continuous denial made that massive distortion of the euro zone ran and continues to massively threaten the development of the whole of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal was that this denial revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the forces within the euro zone, within the European group, continue to be elected."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try a business system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism into life, one may perhaps delay a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see in advance?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its layout.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes made in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or anyone who exists after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims, he did not make any mistakes, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake had to sign the request for renewal of the end of February at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">"I believed that there was an honest interest in the donor, a common solution."</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government to the case only because they did not want to deal with the enforcement of the euro zone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to confess that they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"that's worse than during the" Great Depression. ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none from the Troika of the donors who imposed on us this policy, stressed:" that was a colossal mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all that, and despite the aggressive table of talks, you seem to be still quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they do not survive, the shared tile forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>

<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price, most of them have never heard, though he probably is responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for so many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">That's going back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leader at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an iteracy and describes himself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technique, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for making the shows and the content of the Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series you can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated at nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking bath, "" Game of Throne, "" The Wire "-- all the shows, addictive, where, after having looked at a season, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows how" Toddler and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what goes on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think that you already have special intelligence to offer" "Toddler and Tiaras". ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the average yield, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they are simply not enthralled."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon does something, that's why Roy Price is nothing to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs a guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and choose eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online where they can look at each other free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon gives out a lot of things, one does not attack properly?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they will be observed at the look of these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who will record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can grasp how to start the show when you are pressing, which parts you skips and look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"they collect millions of data, in order to decide on these data which show them should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom via four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," "Alpha House", "but it seems that not many will remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lanced at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"approximately at the same time with another company, another manager placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it but he makes it something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing a competition, he and his team saw the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they show the shows, their course, what shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which actors, what actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom of four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"house of Cards." Netflix has a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons. "</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what is happening here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"it has two very powerful petitive, data irreversible companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data for a decision which one meets, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized with very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good television, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so, then this is a bit scary because we are living in a time where we can take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone know the company multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, this is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into touch with this software. come in touch, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here and ask for dismissal, it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal is made or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"mid-sized TV, 22 minutes, this can be real bad but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results generated. this is not the fact that a company like multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the dates of the most reputed companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"2009, Google announced that they can predict data analysis kinds of flu, the terrible kind, predict -- by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked flawlessly, year round year until it suddenly didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data irreversible companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors flows into decisions of life - at work, in the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for anti-cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medicine. over the years I recognized several samples of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, just do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, put this problem in its parts, so you can analyze the items; as a result, you put the parts again together to write a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something that the brain is good, it is possible to add parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision - especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that's why I think, Netflix was so successful, because they have used data and minds where they belong to the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, why they would otherwise have been able to do better. but the decision, how to put all these parts again, and make it a show like" House of Cards "," which was not in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their choices, first as they are called for TV ideas, then as she chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and not to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball ". it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-issue, you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely "-- just here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will discuss it later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I met some decisions in my life, while I should hear in retrospect on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace them by something much more cloned, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"perhaps the ball becomes wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news, that despite the large amount of data still pays out, decisions to be an expert in what you do, and risk."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
